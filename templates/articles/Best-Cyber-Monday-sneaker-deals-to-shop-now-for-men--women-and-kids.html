The weekend following Thanksgiving is surely a time to sit back, relax and kick your feet up. But, how about shopping for new kicks?

Thanks to Cyber Monday, a roster of online retailers are hosting epic deals on sneakers for women, men and kids. That said, we’re fascinated by all the markdowns — so much so that we rounded up a must-have list of all the styles that we can’t stop glossing over.

From Amazon and New Balance to Nike and Nordstrom, we want you to be alerted of the best offers available now. Whether you’re looking for a pair to match with some of your favorite athleisure pieces or an all-white pair to match with some J.Crew classic clothing styles (side note: shop its Cyber Monday Sale for 50% off), we have you covered — well, from the ankles down, anyway.

Ahead, find all the deals to grab while they’re available.

Best Amazon Cyber Monday Sneaker Deals

Amazon

Meet one of the best Cyber Monday sneaker deals we found: the Guess Women’s Loven Sneaker. We’re beyond obsessed with its classic charm (for only $30 right now, may we add).

Amazon

You can’t go wrong with adidas, and the brand’s Men’s Daily 3.0 Sneaker is one of the nicest pairs we found — on one of the biggest markdowns on Amazon. Browse through other colors, too.

Amazon

Adorable and comfortable, the Under Armour Kids’ Sneaker has a velcro topper (a bonus, may we add) and is less than $50 for you to grab this Cyber Monday.

Best New Balance Cyber Monday Sneaker Deals

New Balance

Shop the New Balance Women’s Fresh Foam X Cruz v3 Sneaker — one of the brand’s most popular options. We love its durable, match-all exterior and versatility, most of all.

New Balance

Podiatrists recommend the New Balance Men’s Fresh Foam Arishi v4 Sneaker — as far as running shoes go — and it’s perfect if you’re on the hunt for a chic black pair that’ll hold up well. Say it with us: add to cart.

New Balance

Vibrant, athletic and — of course — spunky, the New Balance Kids’ DynaSoft Reveal v4 BOA Sneaker is a pair to add to your cart this Cyber Monday. They’re on a great deal and are extremely breathable, too.

Best Nike Cyber Monday Sneaker Deals

Nike

We have our eyes on this cream and white pair (with a purple pop). The Nike Women’s InfinityRN4 Road Running Shoes are 25% off with promo code CYBER at checkout — and, one of our favorites.

Nike

For a classic pair of men’s sneakers, this white-and-red pair is tough to beat. The Nike Men’s Air Jordan 1 Low OG Sneaker is just over $100 and a pair of swift kicks to gift to your loved ones (or yourself) this holiday season.

Nike

Grab the top-rated Nike Big Kids’ Court Legacy Sneaker for your child to be one of the most stylish at school. Better yet, they can be dressed up with a pair of chinos to a family dinner. #Score.

Best Nordstrom Cyber Monday Sneaker Deals

Nordstrom

Yes, Tory Burch is $100 off at Nordstrom right now, and we can’t stop glossing over the designer’s Women’s Double T Howell Court Sneaker. All white and embossed with the signature logo, they’re one of the most well-made pairs on this edit.

Nordstrom

We love On, and the brand’s acclaimed Men’s Cloud 5 Waterproof Running Shoe is now nearly 30% off at Nordstrom. For a trusty all-black pair (among other colors), this one’s your best bet.

Nordstrom

We can’t resist — the Vans Baby Old Skool Sneaker are simply too cute (and we want them in adult sizing!) For less than $35, they’re one of the easiest add-to-cart purchases you can make this Cyber Monday.
