                <textarea id="text" readonly> Michelle Williams and her husband Thomas Kail made a lovely couple as they made a date night out of the Gotham Awards held in New York City on Monday evening.

The 43-year-old actress — who narrated Britney Spears' memoir — wowed in a strapless black gown with a plunging bodice.

The top boasted shell cups at the chest before flaring out slightly at the hips with a peplum design.

The silver screen beauty complemented the look with a necklace featuring two strings of jumbo pearls and gold hardware.

Meanwhile, her husband of three years complemented her look with a spiffy black suit and a black skinny tie with subtle white stripes.

Michelle wore her signature blonde pixie in a sleek and chic tapered style.

Her makeup was soft with tones of a peachy pink dusted over her cheeks for a subtle flushed look.

She looked typically gorgeous with soft black eyeliner and a moisturizing lipstick giving her pout color.

She skipped earrings and wore a single statement-ring on one of her hands, which were sophisticated and simple as she opted to go without nail polish.

Williams added height to her petite frame with a pair of open-toe platform black heels.

The stunner and her theatre director husband kept close at the star-studded event as they walked the red carpet holding hands.

The mom-of-three is up for Outstanding Lead Performance for her role in the 2022 comedy-drama film, Showing Up, co-written and directed by Kelly Reichardt.

The dazzling event was held at Cipriani Wall Street and saw stars like Bradley Cooper, Margot Robbie, and Penelope Cruz step out dressed to the nines.

The Gotham Awards typically kick off the awards show season and the production can be enjoyed on YouTube.

2023 marks the first year the show removed the decade-old budget cap, which only honored films that were made for $35 million or less.

In August Jeffrey Sharp, executive director of The Gotham Film & Media Institute, announced that this season he's 'excited to include more voices from around the globe by expanding eligibility for the many brilliant international films and filmmakers who deserve to be in consideration.' </textarea>
