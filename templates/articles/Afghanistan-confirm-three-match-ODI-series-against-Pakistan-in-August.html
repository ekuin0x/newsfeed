                <textarea id="text" readonly> Afghanistan and Pakistan are scheduled to play a three-match ODI series in August, the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) said on Tuesday, according to a report by Pajhwok Afghan News.

Earlier today, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) also announced a revised Future Tours Programme (FTP) for 2023-2025.

In the revised FTP, Pakistan is supposed to play an away ODI series against Afghanistan in August, 2023. The venue and dates of the series are yet to be announced, but the series is likely to take place in UAE.

Earlier this year in March, the neighbouring countries also played a three-match T20I series in Sharjah, which Afghanistan won by a margin of 2-1.

The aforementioned series between the two countries will serve as preparation for the upcoming Asia Cup 2023.

Asia Cup is scheduled to take place from August 31st to September 17th, under the hybrid model, according to which, the first four matches of the tournament will be held in Pakistan, followed by a shift to Sri Lanka for nine matches, including the final.

Pakistan is expected to play their first group match in Asia Cup against Nepal on 31st August in Multan. The opening ceremony of the tournament will also be held in Multan on the same day. Lahore will be another venue for the Asia Cup matches in Pakistan.

The Men in Green will immediately depart for Sri Lanka after their first match against Nepal. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan will play their group matches in Pakistan before flying to Sri Lanka for the remaining matches.

The official announcement of the Asia Cup schedule will be made by the chairman of PCB management committee, Zaka Ashraf, on Wednesday. </textarea>
