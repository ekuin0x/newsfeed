                <textarea id="text" readonly> We independently selected these products because we love them, and we think you might like them at these prices. E! has affiliate relationships, so we may get a commission if you purchase something through our links. Items are sold by the retailer, not E!. Prices are accurate as of publish time.

Now that the dust of Black Friday has settled and Cyber Monday has yet to hit, we're now in the weekend sweet spot of Small Business Saturday. It's time to support the sellers, companies, storefronts and entrepreneurs out there with diverse backgrounds, community ties, and local fare. And what better place to start than with the small business finds in Oprah's Favorite Thing List. They all arrive with a different story to tell â€“ some are built on family traditions, some are newer on the scene, some started on farms, in kitchens, and more. This roundup includes our picks that would make great holiday gifts for loved ones (or for yourself).

From raw honey on a local bee farm to a home pedicure kit designed by Oprah's own pedicurist, you'll find a range of items for beauty, wellness, style, the kitchen, kids, pets, and more. And if Oprah picked it, you know it's going to be good. These might just be your next fav brands and best of all, they're available on Amazon. So start scrolling, start adding to cart, and start enjoying these small business finds that are Oprah-approved. </textarea>
