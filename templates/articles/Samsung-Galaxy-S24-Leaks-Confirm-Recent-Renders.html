                <textarea id="text" readonly> If you liked the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra renders that were floating around a couple of weeks ago, then there’s good news for you. A few recently released leaks of the upcoming phone allegedly show that it is going to look exactly like the renders. These leaks were originally posted by DavidMa05368498 on X (formerly Twitter) and later, the renowned Samsung leaker, Ice Universe, confirmed the legitimacy of those pictures.



According to the leaks, the phone features a flatter design on both the display and on its back as compared to its predecessors. And interestingly, while its frame is slightly curved, the display is not. Also, it’s already been reported that Samsung is coming for the iPhone 15 Pro with its own titanium build in the Galaxy S24 Ultra, so you can expect a body that should be around 10% lighter than its aluminum counterparts. Earlier rumors also reported that the Galaxy S24 Ultra would have slimmer bezels and that is another feature that the leaks confirm.

In terms of similarities to its predecessor, the camera on this phone doesn’t appear all that different from the one on the Galaxy S23 Ultra. Also, you can, of course, expect the same configurations you have been seeing in the past few years: the Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24 Plus, and Galaxy S24 Ultra. The prices are reportedly similar to the recent S23 phones too with the Galaxy S24 starting at $800, the S24 Plus model at $1,000, and the S24 Ultra at around $1,200.

The Galaxy S23 was released earlier in February, and we can expect the S24 to be released around the same time, which means it will likely be announced soon. According to some insiders, Samsung will announce the phone next year on January 17 at an Unpacked event in San Jose, California. </textarea>
