                <textarea id="text" readonly> Marty Krofft, the creator of iconic children's TV shows including "H.R. Pufnstuf," "Land of the Lost," "Lidsville" and "The Bugaloos," has died. He was 86.

LOS ANGELES -- Marty Krofft, the creator of iconic children's TV shows including "H.R. Pufnstuf," "Land of the Lost," "Lidsville," and "The Bugaloos," has died. He was 86.

Krofft was known to many as the "King of Saturday Mornings." He and his brother Sid were behind classic TV shows like "Sigmund and the Sea Monsters" and "D.C. Follies." They produced family entertainment for more than 50 years.

Krofft died on Saturday afternoon in Los Angeles. His representatives said he passed away from kidney failure.

Marty Krofft and Sid also made their mark in prime time. They produced "Donny and Marie," "Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters" and "The Brady Bunch Variety Hour."

When Sid and Marty got their star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Marty joked about all the TV they'd done over the years.

"For those of you standing here that didn't like some of our shows, keep your big mouths shut!" he said at the time.

Marty said some of the best advice he ever got in show business came from the late Walt Disney.

"He came to our show with Judy Garland. He said, 'Kid, let me give you some advice. Don't ever sell anything you create, and always fight for your name above the title,'" he said.

After Marty's passing, big brother Sid told KABC-TV, "I had my dreams and Marty got them done. I am so grateful for the time I got to work with him on the shows that took you on a trip," adding, "I'm heartbroken."

He's not alone. </textarea>
