                <textarea id="text" readonly> In this piece, we will take a look at Goldman Sachs' top 15 stock picks for 2024. If you want to skip our introduction to the investment bank and the latest saga surrounding its business, then take a look at Goldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024.

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is one of the biggest investment banks in the world. It is also one of the oldest banks around since the institution traces its roots back to the 19th century in 1839. While Goldman Sachs' operations have stood the test of time and the bank is still managing money for clients nearly two centuries after its founding, these days, the bank has landed itself into quite a bit of turmoil.

This is because the bank's plans to target consumer banking turned out to be rather disastrous, forcing Goldman to take multi-million dollar hits to its income statement. The bank's first quarter of 2023 earnings report revealed that it had taken a massive $470 million loss to its loan portfolio as part of an effort to reorganize the retail banking division. The first quarter was particularly hard for Goldman and the banking industry as a whole as several bank collapsed in the U.S. creating worries about the stability of the entire system.

Goldman's second quarter results weren't impressive either as it reported $10.9 billion in revenue and $3.08 in earnings per share, beating and missing analyst estimates for the two segments, respectively. While the first quarter earnings were marred by the consumer banking loan impairments, Q2 was marked by an equally stunning $504 million impairment for the bank's GreenSky buy now, pay later service and $485 million of write downs in real estate. This made it unsurprising that Goldman missed analyst EPS estimates. At the same time, its profit tanked by a painful 60% annually, to touch a three year low. Yet, during the earnings call, Goldman's embattled chief executive officer Mr. David Solomon was in fire control mode as he stressed that momentum in the investment banking business was picking up. During Q2, Goldman's investment banking fees fell to $1.43 billion to miss analyst estimates of $1.49 billion.

Story continues

Unfortunately for Goldman Sachs, the double digit percentage drops during the second quarter wouldn't be its last. The bank's financials for the third quarter saw its profit drop by 33% annually to sit at $2.1 billion for earnings per share of $5.47. This allowed Goldman Sachs to beat analyst EPS estimates during Q3 by a hairline of five cents. The quarterly profit results showed the scale of its troubles since it completed two consecutive years of quarters of annual profit drops. For Goldman, the earnings troubles came at a particularly painful time for the U.S. banking industry which was (and still is) dealing with historically high interest rates and slowing economic output. The bank joined its peers to cut jobs in June 2023, when its chief operating officer shared that a fresh bout of layoffs would cut 250 jobs and build over the thousands more that it had laid off in January.

So, what are Goldman Sachs' views about the future? Well, here's what its management had to say during its third quarter of 2023 earnings call:

Most recently, we announced the sale of GreenSky. We also announced the sale of Personal Financial Management this summer. We sold substantially all of our markets loan portfolio. We have reduced our historical principal investments by $9 billion this year. We are confident that the work we’re doing now provides us a stronger platform for 2024 and beyond. As we assess the operating backdrop, the US economy has proven to be more resilient than expected, though there are reasons to remain vigilant. Treasury rates have risen sharply over the past few months with 10-year yields up 75 basis points in the third quarter. On top of that, recent inflation and employment data has come in above estimates, driving market expectations of higher for longer interest rates. And there still are a number of sectors in the economy that have yet to absorb the impact of higher rates, especially in light of the further tightening in financial conditions we’ve seen over the last quarter. At the same time, there has been an escalation of geopolitical stresses around the globe, the [indiscernible] war in Ukraine, tensions with China and now the conflict in the Middle East. Overall levels of risk are more elevated than we’ve seen in quite some time. While we don’t know where this will all lead, it could impact economic growth and stability in the U.S. and around the world, and we remain cautiously positioned.

So, with the future still uncertain, what are Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2024? We took a look at the bank's latest portfolio and found that its top three picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).
