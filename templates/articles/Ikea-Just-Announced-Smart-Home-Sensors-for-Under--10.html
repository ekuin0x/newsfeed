                <textarea id="text" readonly> Ikea just announced a set of smart home sensors all for under $10. The set includes a door and window sensor named Parasoll, a motion sensor called Vallhorn, and a water leakage sensor called Badring. These are set to be globally released in the first half of next year.

Parasoll is a standard door and window sensor. It can be mounted on any of the two and will let you know when it detects an open or closed action. The cool thing about this sensor is that it can be paired with an Ikea light bulb right out of the box without any additional hassle of investing in and programming a whole Ikea Home smart hub. Parasoll is priced at €9.99 in Europe, and the US pricing hasn’t been announced yet. In fact, the US pricing for all three sensors is yet to be announced.

Vallhorn works like a typical motion sensor and turns on lights or performs other activities when it detects movement. The IP44 splash protection against rain on the Vallhorn means it can be used indoors and outdoors. It is dirt cheap, and its overall setup is extremely economical and simple. It uses three AAA batteries to function and can be paired with up to 10 Ikea smart bulbs straight out of the box.

That’s pretty impressive, considering its €7.99 price tag. Even though we don’t know how much it costs in the US, you can still get an idea of what a good deal you’re snagging when you take into consideration Ikea’s existing motion sensor, which costs $14.99 and senses less room than the Vallhorn, is only usable indoors, and requires its batteries to be replaced more often.

Badring has the potential to be nothing less than a lifesaver for just €9.99. By alerting you as soon as it senses a leak, it can end up saving you a lot of money at its very reasonable price. Badring works by featuring a built-in siren that goes up to 60 dBA upon sensing a depth of at least 1m. </textarea>
