                <textarea id="text" readonly> We're now in the period where Black Friday is over, and we're preparing for Cyber Monday deals – but there's no lull between these two big sales days. Not only are there tons of offers on right now, but they include some of the lowest prices we've seen on some of the best OLED TVs.

In the US, the prices of the Samsung S90C are some of the best value you can get in any TV, in terms of quality for the price. The new prices for last year's LG C2 (formerly out pick as the best TV for most people) make it an incredible buy too. And the super-low price of the LG A2 is just astonishing.

In the UK, the Samsung S90C is even better value, somehow, thanks to fresh price drops combined with a cashback deal. Meanwhile, the 42-inch LG C3 is a phenomenal small TV with elite picture quality.

Early OLED TV Cyber Monday deals in the US

LG C2 65-Inch 4K Smart TV (2022): was $1,899.99 now $1,399 at Walmart

The LG C2 OLED is our best-rated TV, and Walmart has dropped the 65-inch model to a stunning price of $1,399 - a new record-low. The stunning display is praised for its intense brightness and vivid colors in our LG C2 OLED review. The 65-inch TV also packs an a9 Gen5 AI Processor, Dolby Atmos, and voice control – all for under $1,400, which is an incredible value for this highly-rated OLED TV.

Samsung 55-inch S90C Smart UHD 4K OLED TV: was $1,899.99 now $1,299.99 at Samsung

The S90C OLED is the slightly more budget-friendly cousin to the S95C, and it's now on sale for a record-low price of $1,299.99 at Samsung's Black Friday sale. Don't be mistaken in thinking this is the inferior set, however, as it's still one of the best OLEDs you can buy right now. Our Samsung S90C review awarded this one five stars out of five, praising its gorgeous picture and gaming features. It's not as bright as the 95C, and its sound is a little weaker also, but it's a fantastic choice in its own right that anyone would be happy to have in their living room.

It also supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos for movies and the Alpha a9 Gen 5 processor for smoother, cleaner image processing.

Named as one of our best OLED TVs and rated four out of five stars in our LG A2 review, it packs an Alpha α7 Gen5 processor that delivers sharp images and great upscaling from HDR, and Dolby Vision HDR support makes the most of movies and TV. LG's smart software is also excellent, and the included Magic remote allows you to navigate your TV seamlessly.
