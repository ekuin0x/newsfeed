                <textarea id="text" readonly> Some streaming services are offering their best deals of the year.

WASHINGTON — Black Friday is upon us and with it comes sales, deals and discounts on just about everything.

Over the years, Black Friday deals have extended outside of the Friday after Thanksgiving. This year, many retailers were shelling out early Black Friday deals or weeklong "cyber sales" during Thanksgiving week.

During this period, streaming services launched some of their best deals of the year. Here are some streaming Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals to consider.

Hulu Black Friday deal

Hulu is offering a $0.99 per month plan for Black Friday.

The deal, which must be claimed before Nov. 28, is for Hulu's ad-supported tier and is valid for 12 months.

There are some caveats to the deal. The offer is for new customers who sign up for Hulu, meaning it's only available for new accounts and accounts that canceled more than a month ago.

Hulu typically charges $7.99 per month for its regular ad-supported plan. New customers can also add on a Starz subscription with additional programming for another $0.99. Usually, Starz is $9.99 per month.

Disney fans can also add on a Disney+ subscription for $2 more dollars a month. The bundled Hulu and Disney+ subscription, which is for both of the ad-tier plans, would be $2.99 per month.

After the first year, customers will be charged the usual $7.99 unless they cancel their subscription beforehand. It could be more, as streaming services have been raising prices in recent years to keep up with increased competition cutting into their userbases.

MAX Black Friday deal

For Black Friday, MAX is discounting its ad-supported plan to $2.99 per month.

The offer, valid for new and returning customers, is valid for six months and must be claimed before Monday, Nov. 27. The ad-supported plan is usually $9.99 per month.

MAX is also throwing in a B/R sports add-on for a limited time with the offer.

Peacock Black Friday deal

Peacock is offering a $1.99 per month deal for its premium plan.

The deal, which is good for up to a year, ends on Monday, Nov. 27. Peacock's premium plan is their ad-supported tier and is usually $5.99 per month.

Those wishing to shell out the yearly amount all at once can also take advantage of Peacock's annual premium deal. Instead of $1.99 per month for the next 12 months, customers can pay $19.99 for the entire year.

After the first year, customers will be charged the usual streaming fee for Peacock.

Paramount Plus Black Friday deal

For new and former subscribers, Paramount Plus is offering their ad-supported plan for $1.99 per month.

The deal, which expires on Dec. 3, is valid for three months. Those looking to bundle their deal, can get Paramount+ and Showtime for $3.99 per month.

The bundled Paramount+ and Showtime deal has no ads, except for live TV and a few shows, according to the offer details.

The ad-supported tier for Paramount+ is usually $5.99 per month. The bundled plan with Showtime is usually $11.99. </textarea>
