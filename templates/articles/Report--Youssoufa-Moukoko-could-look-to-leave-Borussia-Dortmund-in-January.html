                <textarea id="text" readonly> Youssoufa Moukoko could look to leave Borussia Dortmund in January after being reduced to a bit-part role at the club.

It has been a difficult start to the season for Youssoufa Moukoko, who has been limited to just 66 minutes of playing time in the Borussia Dortmund first-team. The highly rated striker has only been used sporadically by Edin Terzic, with Niclas Füllkrug and Sebastien Haller both ahead of him in the pecking order.

According to WAZ, Moukoko could look to leave Borussia Dortmund in the January transfer window in search of more playing time.

The 18 year old attracted the interest of a number of big clubs before signing a contract extension with Borussia Dortmund earlier this year. However, he has found playing time hard to come by since signing a new three-year contract with BVB. It was reported last month that the BVB bosses would be open to selling Moukoko in January for a substantial transfer fee.

The likes of Chelsea, Real Madrid, Liverpool and RB Leipzig have all been linked with a move for Moukoko in recent months. Werder Bremen and FC Köln were also interested in signing him on loan towards the end of the summer transfer window. But he decided to stay at BVB and fight for his place in the starting XI.

It will be interesting to see what the future holds for Youssoufa Moukoko, who has shown glimpses of his incredible potential since making his first-team debut for Borussia Dortmund in 2020. The striker has made 78 first-team appearances for the Black and Yellows, and has found the back of the net on 13 occasions. </textarea>
