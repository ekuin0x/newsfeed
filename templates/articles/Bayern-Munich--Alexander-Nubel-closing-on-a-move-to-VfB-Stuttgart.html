                <textarea id="text" readonly> Bayern Munich may have significant work to do in the goalkeeping department over the next few days when it comes to transfers. The Bavarian club is facing the prospect of parting ways with two senior goalkeepers. Alexander Nubel is likely to be the first senior goalkeeper to leave Bayern this summer.

According to Sky Sports in Germany, Nubel is closing on a move to VfB Stuttgart. The former Schalke goalkeeper is unlikely to be part of the team presentation at Allianz Arena on Sunday. Nubel may not travel with the squad to Japan for the pre-season tour.

Previously, Bild had reported that Stuttgart is set to sign Nubel on a season-long loan deal. The loan deal has a clause that may see the loan fee decrease depending on the number of matches Alexander Nubel will play next season. The 26-year-old shot-stopper is ready to take a pay cut to join Stuttgart.

Apart from Stuttgart, Leeds United was also interested in signing Nubel. The English club was reportedly ready to sign Nubel on a permanent deal. However, he would have to play in the Championship since Leeds were relegated from Premier League last season. With Stuttgart, Nubel can play at the top level in the Bundesliga this season.

❗️Excl: Secret meeting! Alexander Nübel was on site in Stuttgart yesterday to meet the people in charge: Wehrle, Wohlgemuth, Hoeneß, Krebs. ➡️ @VfB pushing for a loan with an option to buy

➡️ He’s the desired No. 1 for manager Hoeneß

Alexander Nubel has been hell-bent on leaving Bayern this summer. After a productive loan spell of two years in Monaco, Nubel wants to play regularly. The German goalkeeper is aware that the presence of Manuel Neuer in Munich will never allow him to get consistent playing time throughout the season.

Bayern was also ready to hear permanent offers for Nubel. However, it does look like all parties will settle down for a loan deal. It remains to be seen if Bayern wants to extend Nubel’s contract to protect his value. The former Schalke goalkeeper currently has two years left on his contract in Munich.

Yann Sommer is the other senior goalkeeper that is expected to leave Bayern in the current transfer window. The Swiss goalkeeper will become number two next season once Neuer returns to complete fitness. Ahead of Euros next summer, Sommer will prefer a transfer this summer to play regularly next season.

Inter Milan has shown concrete interest in Sommer. However, there is no agreement between the two clubs. Sommer will travel to Japan with the squad on Tuesday. Since Neuer is still recovering from a serious leg injury, Sommer’s move away from Munich may take place later in the window. </textarea>
