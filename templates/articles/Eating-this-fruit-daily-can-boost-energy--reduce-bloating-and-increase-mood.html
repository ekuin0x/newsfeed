                <textarea id="text" readonly> This is bananas!

If you’re looking for a simple way to increase your nutritional intake, all you have to do is have a banana a day.

The fruit has a long list of nutrients, such as potassium, vitamin C, vitamin B6, fiber and more.

The good news is that bananas are easy to add to your diet. Just add one to a smoothie, yogurt or cereal, or use them as a topping for toast with peanut butter. If you’re in a hurry, grab one and eat it plain on the go.

Eating a banana every day is a healthy diet choice, but be sure not to overindulge since the calories from carbs could lead to an overload in sugar intake, resulting in high blood pressure.

Adding bananas to your daily diet can have a wide range of benefits — here are just some of those benefits:

Nutrients

Bananas may have little protein and no fat, but they are rich in carbs, water, fiber and antioxidants. According to the US Department of Agriculture’s FoodData Central, one medium banana contains 1 gram of protein, 29g of carbs, 3g of fiber and 112 calories.

The fruit also contains 12% of the Daily Value (DV) of vitamin C, 7% of the DV of riboflavin, 10% of the DV of potassium and 8% of the DV of magnesium.

Improved blood sugar levels

Bananas have high levels of soluble fiber, which dissolves in liquid to form a gel during digestion. Unripe bananas have resistant starch, a fiber that isn’t digestible.

These two types of fibers can work together to moderate blood sugar levels and regulate appetite.

Digestive health

Bananas have high levels of dietary fiber, which has been linked to improved digestion.

As noted, unripe bananas contain resistant starch, a prebiotic that goes to your large intestine and becomes beneficial food for the gut bacteria (probiotics).

Pectin, a fiber found in both ripe and unripe bananas, can help soften stools and prevent constipation — and could potentially reduce the risk of colon cancer.

Bloating

Leigh Weingus, a reporter from Parade, ate a banana every day for a week and discovered that it helped reduce bloating. She noted that during this time of year, she is typically eating more sugar and nutrient-void foods, resulting in more bloating and less regulated digestion.

Thanks to the fiber and prebiotics in bananas, both of which are known for gut health and digestion, the reporter found that the bloating significantly decreased by the end of the week.

Natural energy

The trio of natural sugars in bananas — glucose, fructose and sucrose — combined with the carbohydrates make the fruit a perfect way to give yourself long-lasting energy for the day.

Weingus also noted that she felt less exhausted and had more energy than she did on a normal basis when she had a banana daily.

Weight loss

While there are direct studies analyzing the link between bananas and weight loss, many of the fruit’s traits point to it being helpful for losing weight.

At just over 100 calories, bananas are nutritious, filling and packed with fiber, which could make you feel full longer.

The soluble fiber adds bulk to the digestive system and slows digestion. However, since the fruit is low in protein, it’s important to pair it with a protein-rich food.

Weingus noticed this as well. “While I usually reach for a 10 a.m. snack, when I had a banana with breakfast, I noticed that I was able to make it all the way to lunch without grabbing a snack,” she wrote.

Heart health

Bananas are a great source of potassium, which can help lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of hypertension.

Magnesium is another nutrient important for heart health, and a deficiency of the nutrient (hypomagnesemia) could be linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure and high levels of fats in the blood.

The fruit counteracts the sodium and brings balance into the diet.

Source of antioxidants

Flavonoids and amines are some of the antioxidants found in bananas and have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease and macular degeneration.

Bananas are also a source of dopamine and catechins, which can prevent the onslaught of oxidative stress and can be anti-aging.

Mood booster

Bananas are rich in tryptophan, which is converted in the body into serotonin, naturally boosting your mood — making it a literal comfort food.

Improve insulin sensitivity

Particularly important for those with several chronic diseases, especially type 2 diabetes, studies have shown that making resistant starch a regular part of your diet can improve insulin sensitivity, allowing the body to be more responsive to the hormone.

Kidney health

The potassium levels in bananas could be beneficial for keeping the kidneys in good health. Potassium has also been linked to lower blood pressure.

A 2019 study found that participants with early-stage chronic kidney disease linked potassium with a slower development of kidney disease.

Supports post-exercise recovery

With easily digestible carbs and high levels of potassium and magnesium, bananas act as a source of electrolytes, which are lost through sweat during exercise.

Putting potassium and magnesium into your body after a workout can reduce muscle cramps and soreness. </textarea>
