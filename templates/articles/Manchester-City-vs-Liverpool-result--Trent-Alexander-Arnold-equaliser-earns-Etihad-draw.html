                <textarea id="text" readonly> Just two points separate the Premier League’s top four (see table below) as top flight football resumes after the international break, and this game between Manchester City and Liverpool can set the tone for what is to follow.

With no interruptions until mid-March, this period promises to shape the title race. Pep Guardiola’s team are odds-on favourites, but the next few months will reveal whether Liverpool, Arsenal or the pair of them will be City’s closest challengers.

Jürgen Klopp was unhappy with such a big fixture being given the Saturday lunchtime slot, but there are reasons for Liverpool to be optimistic. They sit just one point behind City, but have amassed more expected goals and shots per game. Liverpool could well have the division’s most potent attack, with Mohamed Salah producing goals and assists at a frightening rate and Darwin Núñez training on from his debut season. The numbers say they are more porous than City though, and a midfield short of a high-class No 6 faces a stern test at the Etihad. Liverpool have won just one of their last eight league visits to City.

There was a small injury scare for Erling Haaland over the international break, but the City striker is expected to be available. Striking the right balance in midfield could be key for Guardiola. They were too blunt at Arsenal but too porous at Chelsea, when a team featuring Haaland, Julián Álvarez, Phil Foden and Jeremy Doku was cut apart.

City will be hoping John Stones is fit again. Their 4-1 victory in this fixture last season was one of the first occasions they deployed Stones in a midfield role alongside Rodri, in something like a 3-2-4-1 shape. Guardiola has asked Manuel Akanji to perform the same function, but there is no doubt that Stones is the more suited to it.

Full team news on the way shortly. </textarea>
