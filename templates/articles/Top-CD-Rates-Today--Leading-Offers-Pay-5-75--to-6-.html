*Indicates the highest APY offered in each term. To view our lists of the top-paying CDs across terms for bank, credit union, and jumbo certificates, click on the column headers above.

Note that jumbo CDs don't always pay a higher return than standard certificates. Sometimes you can do just as well—or better—with a standard CD. That's currently the case in five of the eight terms above, so it's smart to shop both certificate types before making a final decision.

How High Will CD Rates Go This Year?

The Federal Reserve has been aggressively combating decades-high inflation since March of last year, raising the federal funds rate with fast and furious hikes in 2022 and then more moderate increases in 2023. This has created historically favorable conditions for CD shoppers, as well as for anyone holding cash in a high-yield savings or money market account.

The Fed opted to hold rates steady on Nov. 1, its second such move in as many meetings. That maintains the central bank's benchmark rate at its highest level since 2001. But in his post-announcement press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell made it clear that holding rates in place right now does not necessarily mean the committee is finished with increases.

"Inflation has moderated since the middle of last year and readings over the summer were quite favorable," Powell said. "But a few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal."



However, monthly inflation data released last week was encouraging, coming in below expectations. As a result, financial markets now predict the Fed will not make any further rate increases, with odds for an increase at the committee's December and January meetings down to 5% and 12%, respectively, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.



As we always caution, trying to predict the Fed's future rate moves is an unreliable exercise. But for now, it seems CD rates are unlikely to climb and could ease down from their historic peaks.



Note that the "top rates" quoted here are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research on hundreds of banks and credit unions. This is much different than the national average, which includes all banks offering a CD with that term, including many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, the national averages are always quite low, while the top rates you can unearth by shopping around are often five, 10, or even 15 times higher.

How We Find the Top CD Rates Today

Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying certificates in every major term. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the CD's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000.

Banks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.
