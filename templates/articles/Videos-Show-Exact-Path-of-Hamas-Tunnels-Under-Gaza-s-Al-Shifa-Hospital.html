                <textarea id="text" readonly> Videos taken by Israeli army spokesperson and journalists who toured the tunnels underneath Gaza's Al-Shifa Hospital make it possible to chart the underground routes Hamas has constructed in the compound.

The tunnels that were shown to journalists on Wednesday stretch for about 160 meters and lie underneath the northeastern part of the Al-Shifa compound. The underground network begins under the southeastern part of the Qatari building, which houses the internal medicine wards. The tunnel is blocked from the side leading to the Shifa – Ezz Aldine Al-Qassam Street.

The tunnel continues to the northwest, veering right after some 50 meters. Still underneath the Qatari building, the tunnel leads to a room equipped with electricity and comms infrastructure, with a toilet across the room. A sink has been installed further down the tunnel. A large room opens up after a few more meters, containing beds, a table and air conditioning, and another toilet.

The tunnel continues to the northeast. In videos from the ground one can see the Israeli army broke open an entrance to the tunnel, between the Qatari building and the nearby building housing an emergency generator. That is where journalists descended down to the tunnels.

Underneath the generator building, inside the tunnel, a circuit box has been installed. The tunnel continues northeast toward Ibn Sina Street, yet the passage is blocked. IDF spokesperson explained in the video that across the street – outside the hospital – another tunnel has been found.

At this point, the tunnel underneath the hospital turns left to the northwest, where a blast door was located. This blast door appeared in a video the IDF released earlier this week. A K9 equipped with a camera reached this door – from the other side - after being lowered from a shaft located under a destroyed building, near the fence, inside the hospital compound.

From the early stages of the war, Al-Shifa Hospital drew global attention, embodying the global dispute over the legitimacy of the IDF's actions. Army Spokesman Brig. Gen. Daniel Hagari had announced that the IDF obtained precise intel, proving that Hamas operates from inside the compound – the most important medical institution in the Gaza Strip. Hagari presented illustrations to support his claim that a central Hamas HQ lies under the hospital, but these claims were denied by both Al-Shifa's management and by Hamas. Meanwhile, international opinion was divided over the legitimacy of the army's entrance into a hospital compound.

Several days ago, as Israeli troops entered the compound, Hagari presented his initial findings. Yet these did little to put the international debate to rest. Only after several days of operating in the area did the army locate the Hamas tunnels passing through the heart of the compound, and invited journalists to see them with their own eyes. This serves as the unequivocal proof that the terror group used the hospital for its military needs.

The Israeli army believes that Al-Shifa houses more tunnels, as well as additional Hamas equipment. Israeli troops have yet to enter many areas in this array, yet Haaretz correspondent Yaniv Kubovich – who toured the tunnels on Wednesday, reported that the IDF is considering ending its operation in the area. </textarea>
