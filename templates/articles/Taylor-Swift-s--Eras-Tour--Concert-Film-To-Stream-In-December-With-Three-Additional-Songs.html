                <textarea id="text" readonly> Taylor Swift‘s Eras Tour concert film will begin streaming on Dec. 13 – the superstar’s birthday – and will include three additional songs not included in the theatrical release.

The extra songs, Swift announced on social media today, are “Wildest Dreams,” “The Archer” and “Long Live.”

“Well, so, basically I have a birthday coming up and I was thinking a fun way to celebrate the year we’ve had together would be to make The Eras Tour Concert Film available for you to watch at home!,” Swift wrote on X/Twitter. “Very happy to be able to tell you that the extended version of the film including ‘Wildest Dreams,’ ‘The Archer’ and ‘Long Live’ will be available to rent on demand in the US, Canada & additional countries to be announced soon starting on … you guessed it, December 13.”

The film’s theatrical release has been a big success: Earlier this month, the film’s box office grosses passed $232 million globally, AMC CEO Adam Aron said Wednesday.

The streaming announcement was a surprise for fans, who have been anticipating that Swift’s next big reveal would be the release date for a new “Taylor’s Version” album re-recording, this time the Reputation album. No word on that project just yet. </textarea>
