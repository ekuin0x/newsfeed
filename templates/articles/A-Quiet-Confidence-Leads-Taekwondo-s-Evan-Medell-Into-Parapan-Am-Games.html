                <textarea id="text" readonly> There is no doubting the confidence of Evan Medell. The 26-year-old from Grand Haven, Michigan, has earned the right to have that level of self-assuredness due to the success he’s had both nationally and internationally.

It isn’t a cockiness, either. He just knows that he’s one of the best Para taekwondo athletes in the world. After all, he brought home Team USA’s first Paralympic taekwondo medal when he won bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Games. He’s been a force in his weight class for years.

“I would say my confidence comes from how much work I put in,” Medell said Tuesday.

Medell will be putting in work this weekend representing Team USA at the Parapan American Games in Santiago, Chile. Coming off a rare loss in the gold-medal bout at the world championships in September, Medell is seeking to regain the top spot on the podium Saturday in the men’s +80 kg. K44 class.

He is in competition shape based on eight weeks of training in Miami for the worlds, and he’s definitely motivated. Of his expectations in Santiago? Simple.

“I guess to win,” Medell said. “I’ve done pretty well in this region. Just have a good tournament.”

Losing at worlds in Veracruz, Mexico, had much more to do with Medell’s opponent. In sizing up the bracket, Medell had pegged Ivan Mikulic, the Paralympic silver medalist of Croatia, to come out of the other side. After all, they were the top two seeded competitors, with Mikulic No. 1 despite Medell being the top-ranked athlete in the division earlier in the year.

However, the weight classes underwent an overhaul this year in the lead-up to the Paralympic Games Paris 2024. Previously, Medell was in the +75 kg. division. It’s basically an 11-pound difference, going from 165 to 176.

With the hierarchy of the new class still sorting itself out, Mikulic was upset in the quarterfinals by eighth-seeded Alisher Garipollayev of Kazakhstan. The Kazakh was then knocked off by 12th-seeded Matt Bush of Great Britain. That set up the battle for gold between Bush, a 34-year-old from Wales, and Medell, who had won his three bouts handily. While Medell had more experience than Bush — he has been competing internationally since 2015 — his foe from Great Britain had a significant size advantage. </textarea>
