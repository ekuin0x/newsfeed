                <textarea id="text" readonly> Being in a couple can be tricky, but a Hollywood couple? Where you have virtually no privacy, the insane amount of obligations, and more? Forget about it. That’s why people are so impressed when celebrity couples last decades upon decades, it can be hard with all that added pressure. While Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck have been making the media rounds with their reported fights, pals say they’re just navigating it all together. However, there’s reportedly one issue brewing that may end up being one of the couples’ biggest fights yet.

If you’ve been keeping an eye on Bennifer 2.0 since they rekindled their romance, chances are you notice a few things: Affleck’s perpetually tired expression, their body language, and, of course, that Affleck seems to always be the one in the driver’s seat.

Even on Nov 24, the Good Will Hunting star was pictured dropping Lopez off at the gym, in photos obtained by Page Six. And his constant chaffeuring is allegedly causing issues for them.

“She hates driving and feels much safer riding shotgun. From J.Lo’s point of view, it’s her man’s duty to get her from place to place safely,” the insider said to OK. “Ben’s getting a little tired of being her chauffeur. He might hire himself a driver — maybe she’ll get the hint!”

They added, “He’s behind the wheel twice as much, it’s no wonder he’s having fender benders.”

For those that don’t know, Lopez and Affleck were together from 2002 to 2004 after meeting on the set of Gigli. A few years later, they called off their engagement. But they rekindled their romance in 2021, and they tied the knot a year later.

Since then, there have been reports that they’ve fought over his relationship with his ex-wife Jennifer Garner, his smoking, and more.
