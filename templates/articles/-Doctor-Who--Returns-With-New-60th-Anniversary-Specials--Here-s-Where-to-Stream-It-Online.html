Two years after the end of season 13 and the 2022 Specials, Doctor Who is back with David Tennant as the new Doctor, and Russell T. Davies, who helmed the revival series back in 2005, as a returning writer and showrunner with the new Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials — which drops exclusively on Disney+ today.

The three-part special follows Tennant as the Fourteenth Doctor (who has a striking resemblance to the Tenth Doctor), teaming up with Donna Noble, played by Catherine Tate, on a new sci-fi adventure. The specials will then lead into the TV show’s season 14 with Ncuti Gatwa taking the role as the Fifteenth Doctor.

The anniversary specials also star Neil Patrick Harris, Jacqueline King, Karl Collins, Bernard Cribbins, and Jemma Redgrave, Yasmin Finney and others.

If you’re looking for a way to stream the Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials, Disney+ starts at $7.99 per month with ads. However, you can go ad-free for $13.99 per month, or $139.99 per year. The streaming service is also home to movies and TV shows from The Walt Disney Company, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm (Star Wars), Pixar Animation, National Geographic and more. Watch the trailer, below:
