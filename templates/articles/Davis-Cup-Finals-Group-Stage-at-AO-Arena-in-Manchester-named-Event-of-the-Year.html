The Davis Cup Finals, which took place at the AO Arena in Manchester on 12-17 September has been awarded Event of the Year at the MCR Active Manchester Sports Awards.

The event saw the Lexus Great Britain Davis Cup team joined by teams from Australia, Switzerland and France competing for a place in the knock-out stage of the historic and prestigious Davis Cup competition.

The unique atmosphere of the Davis Cup was on full display as five days of competition culminated in a thrilling victory for Great Britain over France in front of a record crowd of 13,000 fans – Britain’s biggest Davis Cup crowd in the 123-year history of the competition.

The Davis Cup which was delivered by the LTA in partnership with Manchester City Council and Manchester Active, not only brought an inspiring week of world class tennis to Manchester, the first time the event has been played in the city since 1994, but has also helped drive grassroots participation with activities throughout the city, before, during and after the event.

Wider impact of the event can be seen in a number of areas:

Our engagement with schools across Greater Manchester has seen the number of schools delivering our LTA Youth Schools programme rise to over 500 schools across Greater Manchester with a 20% uplift in engagement around the Davis Cup

LTA Youth Schools Just under 500 tickets to the event were used by local schools to attend matches

Since the Davis Cup in September, LTA Youth taster sessions have been delivered in 30 more schools, with 1250 pupils engaged

LTA Youth Team Challenge – Venues in the region were provided with resource packs to deliver special ‘Back the Brits’ team challenges for junior players. Over 50 venues ran Davis Cup themed team challenges throughout the summer, with 837 players taking part, and more Back the Brits events scheduled to coincide with the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga

With 89 park courts in Manchester benefiting from refurbishment and improvement via the LTA Park Tennis Project , the Davis Cup has coincided with a new lease of life to facilities in the area. The event also provided an opportunity to identify and engage with potential new volunteers, including those who could deliver free sessions on Manchester’s park tennis courts

Local players and volunteers were given experience of a lifetime through opportunities to do coin tosses throughout the week, including Thomas Painter an active LTA young leader at The Northern Club and Pride in Tennis ambassador Zak Corbishley.

The LTA Fan Village in Cathedral Gardens saw over 1,500 people give tennis a go on the pop-up courts throughout the week

Chris Pollard, LTA Director of Digital and Major Events, said: “The Lexus Great Britain Davis Cup team delivered tennis that delighted the fans in Manchester throughout the week, and Sunday saw one of the most thrilling and heroic days of Davis Cup tennis we’ve seen. But our vision to open up tennis by hosting major events in more areas of Britain is about a lot more than the on-court action.

"We want to deliver a legacy that lasts beyond the event and through collaboration with our local partners we have delivered tennis to more adults and children, introducing more people to the sport for the first time, and deepening the experience for those already engaged with the sport.”

Tennis was also celebrated with nominations in the MCR Active Club/Organisation of the Year (The Northern & the University of Manchester Tennis Club) and Young Volunteer of the Year (Siddharth Mahala) categories.

The Lexus GB Davis Cup team now head to Malaga as they continue their bid to become 2023 Davis Cup Champions, and face Serbia – who will be led by world No.1 Novak Djokovic – in the quarterfinals on Thursday 23 November. </textarea>
