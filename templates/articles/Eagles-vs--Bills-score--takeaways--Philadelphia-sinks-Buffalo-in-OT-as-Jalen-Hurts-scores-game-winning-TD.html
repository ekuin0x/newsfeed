                <textarea id="text" readonly> PHILADELPHIA -- Jalen Hurts contines to win -- no matter the deficit.

Hurts led the Eagles down the field on a nine-play, 75-yard drive to give Philadelphia aa 37-34 win in overtime over Buffalo. He capped it with a 12-yard touchdown run to give the Eagles the win. This was his 14th straight win against a team with a winning record and his eighth double-digit comeback win in a row -- extending an NFL record. He finished with 200 yards and three touchdowns and 65 rushing yards and two touchdowns.

Allen and two key plays on third down in overtime, a throw for 13 yards to Gabe Davis and a 15-yard scramble to extend the Bills possession (Buffalo won the toss and got the ball first). The possession ended in a Tyler Bass 40-yard field goal to put Buffalo up 34-31 with 5:52 left in overtime.

Two Jason Kelce false starts significantly hurt the Eagles' drive to tie it or potentially take the lead. The false starts put the Eagles back in a fourth-and-17, which Jake Elliott had to kick a 59-yard field goal for the tie -- and force overtime. Elliott converted the kick to tie the game at 31-31 with 20 seconds left.

Allen threw a go-ahead touchdown pass to Gabe Davis for a 7-yard score to give the Bills a 31-28 lead with 1:52 left. He had a phenomenal game for the Bills, throwing for 315 yards and two touchdowns while rushing for 63 yards and adding two rushing touchdowns. He had multiple big passes throughout the day as the Bills finished 11 of 19 on third down, with the only hiccup being the interception to James Bradberry deep in his own territory that set up the Eagles to take the lead.

Hurts brought the Eagles back from another 10-point deficit, throwing for three touchdowns in the second half to give the Eagles a 28-24 lead midway through the fourth quarter. The Eagles quarterback threw touchdown passes to A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith, and Olamide Zaccheaus to give the Eagles the lead. Zaccheaus's 29-yard grab in the back of the end zone with 11:07 left put the Eagles in front, a stretch where Hurts had three touchdowns on his four pass attempts.

Check out takeaways below from this thriller from Philadelphia.

Why the Eagles won

Jalen Hurts went on an unbelievable run in the second half to lead Philadelphia to its fourth consecutive double-digit comeback victory -- the most to begin a season in NFL history. Hurts led the Eagles to 31 second-half points, throwing for three touchdowns and rushing for the score (which was the game-winner).

Hurts finished 14 of 20 for 137 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions in the second half and overtime, along with seven carries for 43 yards and a score. This after going 4 of 11 for 33 yards with an interception in the first half -- having a 7.0 passer rating. He finished 18 of 31 for 200 yards with three touchdowns and an interception (96.2 rating), while rushing for 65 yards and two scores.

Why the Bills lost

The Bills dominated the first half of this game, but miscues on two Tyler Bass field goals kept the Eagles within striking distance. Bass had a 34-yard kick tipped at the line by Jalen Carter that resulted in a miss and would have put Buffalo up 13-7 and a missed 48-yard kick early in the third quarter that would have given Buffalo a 20-7 lead.

The second miss was costly, as Jalen Hurts led the Eagles on three straight possessions with a touchdown. The Eagles scored on five of their last six possessions, staying within 10 points because of two missed field goals when Buffalo could have put them away.

Hurts woke up, but the Bills helped awaken him.

Turning point

Jake Elliott's 59-yard field goal to force overtime is in conversation for kick of the year. Kicking in the pouring down rain, Elliott's boot looked to be short, but he ended up making it by a few yards.

The Eagles were driving for the winning touchdown before two Jason Kelce penalties backed up the offense, setting Elliott up for the long kick (the third-longest field goal in Eagles history and the longest to tie a game). Elliott said it's the hardest kick he's ever made.

Play of the game

Jalen Hurts' 12-yard touchdown run to win the game for the Eagles and cap the double-digit comeback victory. Hurts led the Eagles on a nine play, 75-yard drive, sealing the win on a first-and-10 from the Bills' 12-yard line.

Jason Kelce had a pancake block to set Hurts up for the winning score.

The quote

"Experience is the biggest teacher. I think that's for y'all to decide, truly." -- Jalen Hurts on his ability to rally the Eagles back and being labeled a clutch quarterback. Hurts finished 14 of 20 for 137 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions in the second half and overtime, along with seven carries for 43 yards and a score.

Up next

The Eagles (10-1) play host to the San Francisco 49ers in a matchup between arguably two of the NFC's best teams next Sunday. The Bills (6-6) have their bye before facing the Kansas City Chiefs on Dec. 10. </textarea>
