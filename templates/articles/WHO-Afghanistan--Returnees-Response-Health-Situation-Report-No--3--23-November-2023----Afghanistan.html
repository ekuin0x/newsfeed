An influx of Afghan returnees from Pakistan started in September 2023, with the daily average of over 17,000 in early November.

As of 18 November, 374,600 returnees were recorded.

Approximately 48% are females.

Between 15 September and 18 November 2023, a total of 255,500 returnees have arrived at Torkham (Nangarhar Province) and 116,000 at Spin Boldak (Kandahar Province)

Since 1 November 2023, WHO and its Health Cluster partners have reached 92,138 returnees (31,846 women, 22,329 men, 19,952 girls and 18,011 boys) with various health services.

SITUATION UPDATE

As of 18 November 2023, over 374,600 returnees have arrived at the Afghanistan borders since September 2023, when Pakistan decreed to repatriate illegal foreigners. These returnees stay in temporary shelters in reception centers or camps before reaching their intended destinations (mainly Nangarhar, Kandahar, Kunar and Kabul), exposing them to vulnerable living conditions, with almost 24% being children under five years of age and 48 % are women.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and its Health Cluster partners have ramped up efforts to deliver essential healthcare services to the returnees. Between 1 and 21 November 2023, they have provided various health services to 92,138 returnees (56.2% female) across six regions: eastern, southern, western, southeastern, northern and central regions.

Aligned with the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005), WHO has actively worked to enhance core capacities at points of entry (PoE) in the country, closely cooperating with authorities. Two emergency hospitals in Torkham and Spin Boldak have been operationalized, providing emergency healthcare services and referrals for those crossing borders.

Additionally, WHO has deployed surveillance support teams (SSTs) at PoEs to detect alerts and respond to any potential outbreaks promptly. To mitigate the risk of disease outbreaks and transmission of wild poliovirus transmission, WHO supports enhancing immunization services for returnees. Between 12 and 18 November (week 46), around 53,671 returnees were vaccinated with oral polio vaccines (OPV) in Nangarhar, Kandahar, Hilmand, Zabul, Herat,

Paktika, and Kabul by 59 vaccination teams.

Despite these efforts, public health risks persist among the vulnerable returnee populations, including infectious disease outbreaks, noncommunicable diseases, malnutrition, and mental health problems. Critical challenges include a lack of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities, posing immediate threats. WHO has developed a strategic response plan for the returnees. To provide urgent support, WHO has requested US$10 million for six months. </textarea>
