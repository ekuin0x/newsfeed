                <textarea id="text" readonly> Actor and comedian Tiffany Haddish has been arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence.

The Beverly Hills Police Department confirmed to USA TODAY Friday that officers arrested Haddish, 43, following a DUI investigation in the morning. Police said she appeared to be found slumped over the wheel of the vehicle while the car engine was still running.

The precinct had received a call at 5:45 a.m. about a vehicle stopped on Beverly Drive with an unresponsive person inside.

The "Girls Trip" star was arrested around 7:30 a.m. and faces a misdemeanor DUI charge, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's records. Haddish was released in the afternoon with a citation, per her booking record.

USA TODAY has reached out to representatives for Haddish for comment.

Haddish appeared at Los Angeles' Laugh Factory for its free Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday night. Local news station KTLA reported Haddish cracked jokes and helped serve the comedy club's dinner guests.

“When I first started here, I was sitting at the tables eating, I was receiving a meal,” Haddish, who previously experienced homelessness, told the outlet. “Full circle, and I’m so glad to keep doing that.”

This is the second time the Emmy- and Grammy-winning performer has been arrested for such an infraction.

In January 2022, Haddish was arrested in Peachtree City, Georgia, about 40 miles outside of Atlanta. After authorities received a call about a person asleep in a car. Later, an officer saw a vehicle matching the caller's description and stopped Haddish as she pulled into the yard of a residence, Assistant Police Chief Matt Myers said in a news release at the time. Haddish later posted $1,666 bond and was released from the Fayette County Jail.

That same month, she made light of the arrest on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon."

"I can say this, Jimmy: I've been praying to God to send me a new man, a good man," said Haddish, referencing her breakup with rapper Common. "And God went ahead and sent me four in a uniform. I wasn't expecting it."
