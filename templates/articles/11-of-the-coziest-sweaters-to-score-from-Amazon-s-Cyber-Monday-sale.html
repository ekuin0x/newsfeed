                <textarea id="text" readonly> As the first day of winter draws closer and the weather starts to get even colder, stocking your wardrobe with cute and cozy sweaters is just as big of a necessity as a good pair of snow boots and a heavy coat. If your sweater collection is in need of a refresh, you're in luck. Amazon's Cyber Monday sale is in full effect and tons of its most popular sweaters are on major markdown.

From oversized toppers to cute cardigans to sleek turtlenecks, Amazon’s got the goods — and for a fraction of their original price! The only catch? Certain sizes and colors are selling out quickly, so we suggest adding your favorites to your shopping cart ASAP.

MIHOLL Miholl Long Sleeve Loose Blouse $19 $38 Save $19 This versatile femme top is light and flattering, yet keeps you fully covered. You can get it in 42 colors and styles. Tops that are pretty and affordable are tough to come by, but this one's both. At nearly 50% off, we haven't seen the price drop this low since May. $19 at Amazon

MEROKEETY Merokeety Long Sleeve Soft Chunky Knit Sweater $28 $50 Save $22 Get comfy in dozens of colors with this cozy cardi made with soft yarn in a popcorn knit. This super-soft cardigan, which has garnered some 18,000 five-star ratings on Amazon, is just $28 (originally $50) with the on-page coupon. Aside from Prime Day, this is one of the best prices we've seen it marked down to, so take your pick of the many colors and even give one (or two!) as a gift — especially now that the holidays are just around the corner. $28 at Amazon

GABERLY Gaberly Boat Neck Batwing Sweater $33 $60 Save $27 No need to worry about size, because just one size beautifully fits all. This is the lowest price we've seen on this versatile wonder since Prime Day. Prices vary by color, but for nearly 60% off thanks to Cyber Monday sales, you get a gorgeous knit sweater that's cozy and sexy at the same time. It looks sensational and feels just right for winter, with its one-size-fits-all magic taking the guesswork out of finding the right fit — which means it's time to stock up for your wardrobe. $33 at Amazon

Urban CoCo Urban CoCo Women's Drape Front Open Cardigan $23 $50 Save $27 No cheap polyester here — this stretchy cardigan is made with spandex and super-soft viscose and it’s over 50% off. A great deal considering similar cardigans are in the $40 range. And here's your chance to stock up, because this sale won't last, and with 26 colors to choose from, you're bound to find ones to fit your wardrobe and your budget! (Note that prices vary slightly by color.) $23 at Amazon

ANRABESS Anrabess Oversized Crewneck Sweater $34 $63 Save $29 This luxe-looking sweater has a soft knit fabric with a slightly fuzzy texture that doesn’t snag or pill. It’s available in over 20 mostly solid colors, but there are a few striped options. It also comes in sizes extra small to extra large — and according to reviewers, you should order your regular size. $34 at Amazon

ANRABESS Anrabess Long Sleeve Turtleneck $29 $43 Save $14 With 31 colors to choose from, it will be hard to pick just one. With temperatures dropping rapidly, now is the time to start sweater shopping — if you haven't already. But nothing puts a damper on stocking up your closet like seeing eye-popping price tags. At over 30% off, this is a deal you'll want to jump on, $29 at Amazon

LILLUSORY Lillusory Open Front Cardigan $24 $40 Save $16 with coupon This oversize cardigan is so versatile, you'll be able to wear it all year-round. Five-star shoppers say they pair it with leggings and boots in the fall, wear it on freezing winter days, put it on over dresses in the spring and pop it on when the A/C is too cold during the summer. For a sweater that has so many options, it's priced just right, Save $16 with coupon $24 at Amazon

BTFBM Btfbm Ruffle Knit Pullover $34 $54 Save $20 Along with a flirty ruffled neckline and cuffs, this chic sweater also has subtle ribbing at the hem, that helps show off your waistline. The buttons at the top allow you to decide how much skin you want to show and there are 26 styles to choose from. And the fact that it’s nearly 40% off right now makes it one deal that’s too good to miss. $34 at Amazon

ZESICA Zesica Long Sleeve Crew Neck $34 $62 Save $28 with coupon Shoppers are raving about this comfy sweater for its easy fit — the arms are loose, not snug — and flattering cut. It’s everything you want it to be, according to Amazon reviewers, and it is on double discounts right now when you use the on-page coupon. Save $28 with coupon $34 at Amazon

Amazon Essentials Amazon Essentials Lightweight Crewneck $17 $25 Save $8 There are 39 different options to choose from, including fun animal prints, classic stripes and simple solids. And you don’t need to break the bank to shop the top-rated sweater, either. You can get one for as little as $18 depending on which style and size you choose, which is a reasonable price point if you’re already thinking about buying a few. $17 at Amazon

BTFBM Btfbm Half Zip Pullover $32 $42 Save $10 This cute topper has been racking up rave reviews on Amazon, and it’s easy to see why. Not only is it made from a super soft material, but the chunky knit sweater can be worn zipped up or half unzipped over a T-shirt or tank top. Even better, there are 21 styles available. $32 at Amazon
