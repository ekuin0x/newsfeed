                <textarea id="text" readonly> Borussia Dortmund could qualify for the UEFA Champions League round of 16 with a win away to Group F rivals AC Milan on Tuesday (kick-off: 9pm CET).

Latest

Dortmund could secure qualification to the knock-out rounds with victory, having beaten Newcastle in back-to-back games to sit atop Group F - the would-be Group of Death - ahead of Paris Saint-Germain, Tuesday's opponents Milan, and the Premier League side now propping up the rest. Brandt has been Dortmund's primary attacking outlet this season with six goals and six assists in all competitions, but Niclas Füllkrug, a summer signing from Werder Bremen, is coming onto a game having scored one and made another as BVB came back from two goals down to beat Borussia Mönchengladbach 4-2 on Saturday. The Germany No.9 will almost certainly lead the line at the San Siro with Sébastien Haller struggling with a bug. The Ivorian missed the Gladbach game, as did Karim Adeyemi for the same reason. Captain Emre Can has returned to full fitness and Edin Terzić isn't likely to change much as he looks to punch his side's ticket into the next round.

Milan are still alive, and victory could even take them top provided PSG don’t beat Newcastle in the other group game. The Rossoneri are injury-ravaged, however, with former Wolfsburg man Simon Kjær one of five first-team members definitely ruled out, with another handful hopeful of shaking off injuries. One of those is Rafa Leão, who will need handled with care down Milan's left. To that end, the more defensively-minded Niklas Süle should be preferred to Julian Ryerson at right-back. Christian Pulisic is a familiar face for Dortmund, meanwhile, and the USMNT star is in form with six goal-involvements from 10 Serie A games this season. Olivier Giroud missed the 1-0 win over Fiorentina with a domestic suspension, but is available here.

Watch: Brandt in red-hot form

Match stats

Brandt has scored, assisted or both in 11 of his 17 appearances for Dortmund this season.

Marco Reus is Dortmund’s 22-goal record scorer in the Champions League. He has scored twice against Italian opposition (Napoli and Juventus).

With just two goals conceded across four games, Dortmund have the joint-best defence in this season’s groups, along with Inter Milan and Barcelona.

Dortmund celebrated the greatest success in their history against a team from Italy, beating Juventus 3-1 in the 1997 UEFA Champions League final.

Die Schwarzgelben were the last German team to win away to AC Milan, with Jan Koller the matchwinner (18 March 2003).

Pulisic made 127 competitive appearances for Dortmund, registering 19 goals and 26 assists.

Probable teams

Milan: Maignan - Calabria (c), Thiaw, Tomori, Hernández - Krunić, Musah - Pulisic, Reijnders, Leão - Giroud

Out: Bennacer (knee), Caldara (ankle), Kalulu (thigh), Kjær (muscular), Pellegrino (ankle)

Doubtful: Okafor (hamstring), Sportiello (muscular)

Coach: Stefano Pioli

Dortmund: Kobel - Süle, Hummels, Schlotterbeck, Ryerson - Sabitzer, Can (c) - Malen, Reus, Brandt - Füllkrug

Out: Duranville (thigh), Nmecha (hip)

Doubtful: Adeyemi (ill), Haller (ill)

Coach: Edin Terzić

Group F, Matchday 5 Group F, Matchday 5 San Siro, Milan Secret of success? "With a lot of very hard work, we have put ourselves in a great position in the group. We have everything in our own hands," said Füllkrug, whose team are a point ahead of PSG in the section and two clear of Milan with Newcastle a further point back, before revealing the secret to continued success. "Show humility every day, work, work, and do your homework." © IMAGO/Avanti 2:44 Füllkrug form Niclas Füllkrug's strike in the Matchday 11 loss to Stuttgart was his third league goal in his last six top-flight outings. The 30-year-old forward maintained his sensational start to his international career with a tenth goal in just 12 senior appearances for Germany during the November break. Only Bayern Munich's Serge Gnabry has reached double figures for goals in fewer Germany appearances (11) than Füllkrug in the last 45 years. Jovic reunion Pulisic isn't the only former Bundesliga threat in the Milan ranks. Luka Jovic scored 40 goals in 93 competitive appearances in a combined two-and-a-half seasons at Eintracht Frankfurt, including 17 goals in 32 Bundesliga games in a bountiful 2018/19 campaign. Pulisic threat USMNT star Christian Pulisic joined Milan from Chelsea this summer, having left the Signal Iduna Park for Stamford Bridge in 2019 with 19 goals, 26 assists, 127 games and a DFB Cup winner's medal under his belt. He's just coming back from a thigh injury that has kept him out since early November, and Dortmund coach Edin Terzić should know how to put the brakes on the American: he was assistant coach at BVB for Pulisic's final two years in a black-and-yellow shirt. © AFP/Getty Images 1:44 Kobel key? One of the reasons Dortmund have been so stingy is goalkeeper Gregor Kobel, who was superb in the goalless draw at home to Milan on Matchday 2. "The players in front of you are also super cool," the Switzerland international replied when told he looked calm and showed patience in the face of the Italian team's forwards. "If you give them space too soon or choose a side, they see it." Sound defence Edin Terzic's men have struggled to keep domestic rivals at bay, but in continental competition, they are watertight. With just two goals conceded across four games, Dortmund have the joint-best defence in this season’s groups, along with Inter Milan and Barcelona, and they have kept three successive clean sheets. 4:05 Goals galore BVB have been racking up the goals this season so what better time to sit back and enjoy the Black-and-Yellows in goal-getting form! History lesson Sammer was the Dortmund coach when BVB became only the second team to defeat Milan in the Champions League thanks to a Jan Koller goal at San Siro in March 2003. And if you're still curious: Hertha Berlin in 1999 are other Bundesliga victors vs. the Rossoneri in the competition. © Stuart Franklin/Getty Images Sammer impressed "Seven points from four games is very good," said former Dortmund Champions League winner Matthias Sammer, who has seen BVB secure back-to-back wins against Newcastle United to move to the top of Group F. "It's by far the toughest group in this season's Champions League. Beating Newcastle twice is very difficult and they've done that." Welcome! Borussia Dortmund can take a major step towards the knockout stages if they can record only a third win by a German club against AC Milan in the UEFA Champions League when the pair meet on Matchday 5. © IMAGO/Beautiful Sports
