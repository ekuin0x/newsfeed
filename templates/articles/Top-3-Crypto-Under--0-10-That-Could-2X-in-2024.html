                <textarea id="text" readonly> The cryptocurrency market is bracing for another bull run, which analysts anticipate sometime in 2024. Researchers cite the possibility of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) and the BTC halving event next year as possible drivers. The anticipation of a bull run may lead to many new investors entering the crypto market. However, newcomers may want to start with something small that could give high returns soon.

Top 3 crypto under $0.10

Shiba Inu (SHIB):

Source – Outlook

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the most popular crypto tokens in recent years. Although the asset has struggled in 2023, analysts anticipate SHIB to generate significant steam in 2024. The token is down by almost 90% from its all-time high (ATH), which it attained in 2021. Many believe that SHIB could regain its ATH level in the next bull run, if not surpass it. Additionally, SHIB is among the cheapest cryptocurrencies currently available.

VeChain (VET) is another popular crypto asset available under $0.10. VET is a supply-chain-based project that is involved in a lot of environmental and climate change initiatives. Moreover, the project has collaborated with several big global companies. VET is also down by over 90% from its ATH, which it attained in April 2021.

Dogecoin (DOGE):

Dogecoin (DOGE) is one of the most popular crypto assets ever. The token is also the first memecoin. Like SHIB, DOGE has also struggled for most of 2023. However, many anticipate the dog-themed cryptocurrency to skyrocket in the next bull run. Moreover, there are rumors that DOGE could be a part of X’s (formerly known as Twitter) new payment feature. Being a part of X’s payment feature could cause a spike in DOGE’s global adoption and, thereby, a rise in its price. </textarea>
