                <textarea id="text" readonly> The actual Black Friday date is officially behind us, but Black Friday sales are still happening. In fact, a lot of Black Friday's sales start earlier, and end later, than they ever have before. Walmart's Black Friday sale is also winding down, but we're about to ramp right back up again for Cyber Monday. Since those are both marketing terms and not descriptive of actual days, it can be tough to know when Black Friday ends and Cyber Monday begins, so please, allow me to help unravel this retail mystery

When Does Walmart Black Friday End?

Walmart Black Friday Sale 5 See on Walmart

The official cut-off for the end of Walmart's Black Friday sale, according to Walmart itself, is November 26, 2023 at 12:00am local time. What that means, effectively, is anyone's guess, since the Walmart Black Friday deals on TVs, and everything else really, are still happening online. Well, mostly. The best TV deals of Black Friday at Walmart went fast, the return of the $288 TCL 4-Series 65" and $188 TCL 4-Series 55" TV deals.

Since there are still so many online deals, it's kind of hard to say Black Friday has an actual end-date, but basically it's over when they change all the "Black Friday" wording to "Cyber Monday." It's all kind of meaningless now, Amazon Cyber Monday started the day after Black Friday, for example.

When Does Cyber Monday Start at Walmart?

Cyber Monday at Walmart officially begins Sunday, November 26 at 7PM ET/4PM PT. That means there's overlap between Walmart's last-minute Black Friday deals and its day-early Cyber Monday offerings. The main difference between Black Friday and Cyber Monday at Walmart is the lion's share of the Cyber Monday Walmart deals happen online. Many of the Black Friday deals were available both on Walmart's website and in its brick-and-mortar locations.

I'd be surprised if those physical locations shut the door on deals entirely, so be on the lookout for "last minute Black Friday" deals happening in-stores. But Cyber Monday is supposed to be all about the online shopping experience, a marketing term coined back when shopping online was still a novelty.

What Will be On Sale for Cyber Monday at Walmart?

Expect more of the same Black Friday Walmart deals on Cyber Monday, with a heavier emphasis on tech. Cyber Monday PC sales have always been as good, sometimes even better, than on Black Friday. Video game Cyber Monday sales will also almost certainly remain the same as Black Friday. Walmart has the best Xbox Black Friday deal happening on a Diablo IV console bundle, and they will almost certainly keep pushing that one. You can also get the PS5 Slim Spider-Man 2 bundle at Walmart, as well as the Modern Warfare III bundle, and expect those will stick around for Cyber Monday as well. </textarea>
