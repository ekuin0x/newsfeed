Three points on Saturday afternoon would see Arsenal move up in the Premier League table as the Gunners make the short trip to Brentford.

With Man City and Liverpool going head to head in the early kick-off, a win for Arsenal against Brentford will see the Gunners move up to second in the table, but if City and Liverpool draw, three points would move Mikel Arteta's side top. A 3-1 win against Burnley in Arsenal's last outing saw the Gunners bounce back from their tough defeat away to Newcastle, but a two-week international break has handed Arteta's side some time to regroup.

David Raya will be unavailable with the 'keeper ineligible to face his parent club, while Fabio Vieira is suspended after picking up a red card against Burnley. Arsenal and Brentford have already faced each other this season, with Reiss Nelson scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win in the Carabao Cup back in September.

So, could Arsenal make it two league wins in a row? Let's take a look.

We simulated Brentford vs Arsenal to get a score prediction

To complete this simulation, we used EA FC 24 and updated the squads with the latest injuries and suspensions.

We predict that the hosts could line up in a 4-3-3 formation, with their line-up as follows: Flekken; Ajer, Collins, Pinnock, Roerslev; Janelt, Norgaard, Jensen; Mbuemo, Maupay, Wissa.

We predict that the Gunners could set up in a 4-3-3 formation, with their line-up as follows: Ramsdale; White, Saliba, Gabriel, Tomiyasu; Rice, Odegaard, Havertz; Saka, Jesus, Martinelli.

It was an assertive stat for Arsenal in west London, with Kai Havertz having his best game in an Arsenal shirt as he proved the dangerman for the Gunners. Havertz almost set up the opener when his cross to Gabriel Jesus was headed wide of goal, but 24 minutes in, the German got on the scoresheet.

After playing the ball into the feet of Martin Odegaard, Havertz overlapped his midfield partner untracked to enter the box. Odegaard returned the ball to the German, and he rifled a powerful shot into the roof of the net to make it 1-0.

Brentford almost hit back just 40 seconds after kick-off when a long ball forward caught out William Saliba, but Aaron Ramsdale was quick off his line to smother Neal Maupay's shot. After surviving the scare, Arteta's side regained control of the game, and they entered the break with a healthy lead as Gabriel Martinelli made it 2-0 before the break.

As the Gunners camped around the Brentford box, Martinelli rolled the ball into Declan Rice's path before surging into the box for the return pass. Rice lifted the ball over the Bees' back line to the Brazilian, and his curling finish found the bottom corner to double the lead.

Two goals ahead, Arsenal took their foot off the gas in the second half, choosing to hold possession and tire out the hosts. Brentford couldn't find a goal, and the Gunners held out for a straightforward victory.

EA FC 24 predicted final score: Brentford 0-2 Arsenal
