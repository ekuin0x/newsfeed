                <textarea id="text" readonly> Bangladesh and New Zealand register convincing wins

New Zealand will take a lot of positives from its five-wicket win over Pakistan, which involved chasing 346 runs. Among the brightest spots will be Kane Williamson’s fifty on return from a prolonged injury lay-off. Even though he has been ruled out of the first match of the World Cup on October 5, New Zealand will be pleased to see its skipper back among the runs. Rachin Ravindra struck a brilliant 97 while opening the batting and Daryl Mitchell scored a steadying half-century. Mark Chapman and James Neesham then absolutely flayed the Pakistani bowlers to end the game with 38 balls to spare.

Shaheen Afridi didn’t take the field, and in his absence, the Pakistan bowling lacked teeth. Haris Rauf was taken for 36 in his four overs and though Hasan Ali bowled a tight first spell, he strayed in line and length in his second and ended up going at 8.60 runs an over in his 7.4 overs. Shadab Khan too didn’t roll his arm over and Usama Mir, the other leg-spinner in the squad, picked two wickets but was expensive initially.

A lot of questions remain unanswered for the Pakistan bowling attack, which will have to play two games in Hyderabad in the World Cup proper.

Meanwhile, in Guwahati, Bangladesh cruised to a comfortable seven-wicket win over Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka was off to a strong start with the bat in the first PowerPlay but the Bangladesh spinners pulled things back in the middle-overs and restricted Sri Lanka to 263. Bangladesh openers Tanzid and Litton laid the platform with a 131-run stand, after which Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Mushfiqur Rahim ensured there were no twists as the Tigers romped to a facile win.

South Africa and Afghanistan were denied an opportunity to warm-up for the big event as rain ensured no play was possible in Thiruvananthapuram.

However, there is still some time left for teams to give their preparations the final touches. India takes on England in Guwahati and Australia faces Netherlands in Thiruvananthapuram tomorrow at 2:00 PM IST. Joins us as we take you through all the live action. For now, that will be it from us. Thank you and goodnight! </textarea>
