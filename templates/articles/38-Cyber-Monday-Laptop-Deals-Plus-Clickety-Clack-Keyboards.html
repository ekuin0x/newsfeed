                <textarea id="text" readonly> Cyber Monday usually brings a ton of sales on every knick-knack and doodad you probably don't need, but a lot of people work on a laptop. Snagging one of your favorites for a song is one of the best parts of this shopping holiday. You'll rarely get a better chance to nab a new computer, so we've rounded up the best deals we've seen on the models our reviewers recommend. You'll also find some other laptop accessories and peripherals below, including mechanical keyboards.

We test products year-round and handpicked these deals. The discounts we show are based on actual street prices at retailers in the past few months. Products that are sold out or no longer discounted as of publishing will be crossed out. We'll update this guide periodically.

Updated November 27, 2023: We've added new deals on the Razer Huntsman Mini Mechanical Keyboard and a few portable monitors.

Apple Laptop Deals

Read our Best MacBooks guide for more buying advice.

Apple MacBook Air 15-Inch with M2 processor Photograph: Apple

Like its smaller cousin, this 15-inch MacBook Air comes with the second-generation M2 processor that improves on Apple's initial custom-built silicon. It has a retina display, a MagSafe power connector, and 256 gigabytes of internal storage. It's super light and easy to toss into a backpack or laptop bag.

This is the successor to the original M1 MacBook Air. It's faster, and being newer, it will be supported for longer into the future. We've seen this laptop drop to this price before—and occasionally a little lower. But this is still a solid choice for a powerful, super portable machine.

The first Apple laptop to use the company's own silicon might be a few years old, but it's still plenty powerful and holds up really well. In fact, it's the laptop that reviewer Eric Ravesncraft used to write this very article. This model often drops to this price, but it's the lowest price we've tracked.

Apple MacBook Pro with M3 processor Photograph: Apple

The latest MacBook Pro packs the blazingly fast M3 processor, making it capable of editing 4K video on the go without breaking a sweat. It gets up to 22 hours of battery life and has a vibrant 14-inch retina display. If that's somehow not enough power for your needs, the M3 Pro version is also on sale for $1,850.

This version is similar to the other M3 models. It just has a larger screen, a more powerful CPU, and slightly better graphics. Apple's brand-new M3 chips are available in three different MacBook tiers—the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max (9/10, WIRED Recommends). They're all included in our guide to the Best Laptops.

The wide variety of M-series processors gives you a lot of options to get exactly the amount of power you need without spending a fortune. This 14-inch model of the MacBook Pro comes with the M2 Pro processor for a couple of hundred dollars less than the M3 Pro. Beyond that, they're largely the same laptop, so if you don't need maximum horsepower, you can save a bit of cash.

Windows Laptop Deals

HP Envy x360 Photograph: HP

The HP Envy x360 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite 2-in-1 laptops. It has plenty of power for most everyday tasks, plenty of USB ports (both USB-C and USB-A), and a full-size HDMI-out port. Most notably, it also has a 360-degree hinge, allowing you to prop it up, kickstand-style, or fold it flat like a tablet.

It can be difficult to walk the line between cheap and good, but this laptop from Acer is one of the best we've tested. It packs an Intel Core i5 (or AMD 5000 series chip), 8 gigabytes of RAM, and a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS display. It's not the most beautiful screen, and the speakers can be a little quiet, but it's powerful enough for most people.

Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 Photograph: Lenovo

This has been one of our favorite budget laptops for a while. It packs an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor, 16 gigabytes of RAM, and 512 gigabytes of internal storage. It's solid for everyday use and comes with a built-in fingerprint reader. Its hinge allows it to fold completely around to carry around like a tablet. This laptop was even more expensive earlier in the week, making this price even more enticing.

We like the 14-inch version of this laptop, which features most of the same components. You get an AMD Ryzen 7 (7730U) processor, 16 gigabytes of RAM, and 512 gigabytes of storage with a 16-inch touchscreen. That's plenty of power for just about everything, and the large screen is nice for editing photos and browsing the web. It's not a good choice if you're a video editor or gamer, but it'll do for the rest of us.

We like the 15-inch HP Envy (8/10, WIRED Recommends) for its impressive performance, very nice screen, and decent keyboard, complete with a dedicated emoji button. Graphics are courtesy of the integrated AMD Radeon chipset, which underpins the 1920 x 1080-pixel, 16:9 aspect ratio display. It's no gaming rig, but it works. Connectivity options include two USB-C ports with DisplayPort capabilities, two USB-A ports, and an HDMI 2.1 port, plus a full-size SD card reader.

This is the slightly larger, slightly heavier version of the Asus Zenbook 14 we really like (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It has the same gorgeous 14-inch 2.8K OLED touch display that's very impressive for a laptop this size. Unlike the mid-range model we tested, this features an Intel i7 (13700H) with 16 gigabytes of RAM and a 512-gigabyte SSD. You're getting the high-end model for the price of the mid-range. It's plenty of speed for most computing tasks.

This is the newer, faster version of one of our top picks in our cheap laptop guide. You're getting a newer Intel chip (13th gen i5), more RAM (16 gigabytes, a must-have with Windows 11), and a nicer IPS display all for the same price as the pick in our guide. Again, not a gaming rig, but it's fast enough for everyday tasks like browsing the web and editing documents.

Chromebook Plus Deals

Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus Photograph: Lenovo

This is the fastest Chromebook we've tested (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It features a 3.75-GHz Intel Core i3-1315U CPU, 8 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of flash storage. The Flex 5i has two USB-C ports (one is used for charging) plus one USB-A port. You also get a microSD card slot for expanding the storage capability, making this a good choice for those who don't want to keep everything in the cloud.

The Acer 15-inch Chromebook Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a 12th-generation 3.85-GHz Intel Core i3-1215U processor with 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of flash storage. One of the nice things about these new Plus models is it's no longer groan-inducing slow. Even this base model is plenty fast, and battery life is a solid 8.5 hours of full-screen video playback time. Just note that there's no microSD card slot, and it doesn't have a touchscreen.

We haven't tested Asus' Chromebook Plus yet, but some of the best benchmarks we've ever recorded in a Chromebook came from models using AMD Ryzen 3 chips. Given that the Ryzen 3 is the centerpiece here, we have no problem recommending it. Like the Lenovo, this is a 2-in-1 flip (convertible) Chromebook, with a touchscreen. This is the lowest price we've tracked.

HP's Chromebook Plus entry comes in several configurations. Whichever one you get, this is the priciest of the Chromebook Plus range we've seen so far, but this is now the lowest price we've tracked. We haven't tested this one yet, but you get double the hard drive space at 256 GB. Like the Lenovo, HP offers two USB-C ports, one USB-A, and a microSD card slot. If you like HP's design better, this might be one to consider.

2-in-1 Tablet Deals

Read our Best Tablets guide for more options and check out our dedicated roundup of Cyber Monday tablet deals for additional discount recommendations.

Microsoft Surface Pro 9 Photograph: Microsoft

The Surface Pro 9 is our pick for the best 2-in-1 Surface. It uses a built-in kickstand and (optional) keyboard cover to bridge the gap between laptop and tablet. This version comes with a powerful Qualcomm SQ3 processor, 8 gigabytes of RAM, and 256 gigabytes of internal storage. Its battery can last up to 19 hours, though if you go for the optional 5G version, we found it got closer to 7.5 hours.

This version of the Surface Pro 9 uses an Intel Core i5 instead of the Qualcomm SQ3 processor, which is still solidly powerful for most everyday tasks. More importantly, this bundle comes with the Surface Pro Keyboard, turning it into an ideal tablet/laptop hybrid.

Google Pixel Tablet with dock Photograph: Google

While it's not, strictly speaking, a laptop, the Google Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fantastic Android tablet that can attach to a charging dock, turning it into a smart display. The performance and screen are both great for the price, but the battery life doesn't last quite as long as we'd like. It's hit this low price twice now in November but hasn't dropped this low before.

Charger and Accessory Deals

Our Best Portable Chargers guide has even more options for all your devices.

UGreen Photograph: Ugreen

A 25,000-mAh battery pack that's surprisingly compact is a rarity, and this one also packs two USB-C ports, one USB-A, and the ability to draw 145 watts while charging. That means one USB-C port can dish out 100 watts, enough to fast charge a laptop.

This is our portable charger pick for laptops. It has two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and a 100-watt AC port so you can plug in a laptop charger. It fully recharged our Dell XPS 13 nearly twice in our tests.

Charging your laptop quickly takes more power than a phone, which is why we like Anker's charging blocks. This 67-watt charger has fold-out prongs and two USB-C ports, plus one USB-A port that can supply enough power to charge most laptops, and quickly charge most phones.

Zendure SuperTank Pro Portable Power Bank Photograph: Zendure

This battery pack is both portable and powerful. It has a 26,800-mAh capacity (the maximum you can take on a flight), and four USB-C ports—two of which can dish out 100 watts and two that output 20 watts each. We’ve used it to fast-charge MacBooks, iPhones, and other smartphones. There small built-in OLED display that shows the remaining power as a percentage and in-watt hours. You can clip the coupon for an additional 20 percent off.

This charger packs two USB-C ports, one of which can output 65 watts when used alone. If you plug two devices in, the top will deliver 45 watts and the bottom can do 20 watts. It also folds up and looks super sleek.

This handy charger has enough power to juice up two MacBook Pro models simultaneously. But it's also great if you have a lot of devices around your desk that constantly need to be charged. It has a little stand to prop it up, a short cord that goes out to an outlet, and four USB-C ports that output 100 watts each. This is the lowest price we've tracked.

We've used this hub with iPads, but it's also great for MacBooks. Plug it in via the USB-C port on your laptop and you'll have access to another USB-C port for passthrough charging, a USB-A port, an HDMI output, and a headphone jack. It's also fairly compact and thin, so it won't add too much bulk to your laptop. It dipped to $40 back in August, but we still think this is a good deal.

This power bank is our top upgrade pick in our guide to the Best Portable Chargers. It's pricey, but today's deal makes it more accessible. It charges from zero to completely full in an hour and boasts a whopping 24,000-mAh capacity. And it's powerful enough to charge laptops and tablets as well as phones and other gadgets. There's even a built-in display to monitor stats like temperature and remaining battery percentage.

Laptop Stand Deals

Check out our Laptop Stand guide for more.

ObVus Solutions Laptop Tower Stand Photograph: ObVus Solutions

This is our favorite laptop stand. It's sturdy and adjustable in height and angle, and it collapses for easy travel. Deals aren't uncommon, so it's best to buy it while discounted like this. ObVus has a new version of this stand out that we haven't tried, but it's $68 right now and seems to be the same design with the addition of a cell phone stand.

With the ability to flex the stand up to 22 inches high, you can adjust this stand depending on your setup—whether you’re using an external monitor or working solely off a MacBook. It’s also super compact and portable. Our only complaint is that, while you can adjust the stand's angle up to 45 degrees, it’s too wobbly to type on if you're using the laptop's keyboard.

Lone Birch Flex Laptop Stand Photograph: Lone Birch

Enter code SHOPSMALL to apply this discount. The wood is pretty and looks great against a wood desk, and the arm can angle your screen a little bit. There's a small and large size, the latter of which works best for 15-inch or larger laptops.

Moft stands are configurable, and this one angles your laptop from 25 to 60 degrees. It collapses flat too, so you can pack it in a bag. The brand's Smart Desk Mat is discounted to $121 ($37 off) with code BF37. That one balances your laptop, phone, and wireless charging earbuds. It's not as easy to tote around given its size, but it's a great desk companion.

Keyboard and Case Deals

Check out our Best Keyboards guide for more picks.

Photograph: Keychron

This is WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu's current daily keyboard. You can use it wired or wirelessly via Bluetooth and it comes in several colors and switches to pick from (it’s also RGB-backlit). The red switches aren’t very loud but are still clicky, and there’s a great knob for volume control. It’s hot-swappable too, so you can change the switches whenever you’d like.

If you prefer low-profile keys, the K3 Pro is a solid choice. The keys have a tactile click, RGB lighting, and you’ll get around four to five days of battery life (with the ability to charge it via the USB-C charging port). You’ll also get support for Via too, if you want additional software customization.

The Das Keyboard MacTigr (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is expensive, but it’s great for those in the Apple ecosystem with a dedicated Mac layout. It also has cherry MX Red switches (that don’t get too loud), a two-port USB-C hub, and a high-quality all-metal build.

We love mini keyboards, particularly because they take up less space and cut out all the keys you might not use. The Huntsman Mini is one of our top picks in our Best Keyboards guide. It offers customizable key cap options and has a minimalist design.

Photograph: Speck

Speck’s Smartshell case has the proper cutouts for ports, rubberized feet to keep your machine in place, and both pieces lip in securely. You can throw it in your backpack, tote, or duffle bag without worrying about damaging the machine. We tested it with the 14-inch MacBook Pro but it’s available for a wide range of MacBook models, too. It’s worth noting, however, that the hardshell isn’t scratch-resistant (despite Speck’s claims)—we’ve noticed a few scrapes on ours here and there, but it’s not too noticeable.

This is currently our favorite MacBook case. We tested it with the 16-inch MacBook Pro (2021), but it’s available for a few MacBook models. It has rubberized feet that prevent it from sliding, precise cutouts for all ports, and ventilation to keep the MacBook from overheating.

This discount is automatically added in your cart. The 16-inch version Baggu Laptop Sleeve in Sherbet Cherry looks just as cute in person as it does online. The puffiness provides plenty of protection, and the Velcro closure is strong enough you don’t have to worry the laptop will slide out. We tested it with the 15-inch MacBook Air, which left space to squeeze a keyboard and mouse into the sleeve as well. There's also a 13-inch/14-inch version for those who have smaller MacBooks or want a sleeve for their iPads. Baggu's whole lineup is 20 percent off, and we like several of the brand's bags.

Portable Monitor Deals

Espresso 15 Photograph: Espresso

This bundle is expensive, but Espresso makes some of the thinnest and lightest portable monitors out there—complete with excellent color accuracy and touchscreen functionality (even if using fingers on MacOS isn't the greatest experience). This bundle includes the 15-inch display, a Creator screen to make the surface feel more paper-like, a magnetic stand, and a stylus (s you can use Espresso's new Jot software that lets you take notes and mark up almost any screen).

This is WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu's favorite portable monitor. It's a great second screen that doesn't take up any desk space, but it does require sticking adhesive magnets onto your laptop. It's best for 13- to 14-inch laptops and is best for productivity apps like Slack rather than anything that requires crisp colors.

If you've been eyeing a portable monitor but don't want to commit to a major purchase, this is our favorite budget option. The 15.6-inch IPS screen has vivid colors and a 144-Hz refresh rate. There's no shortage of ports either, with two USB-C ports, a mini HDMI, and a headphone jack. It also comes with a folio cover that you can use as a stand (which is typically an extra cost you'd need to buy aftermarket). </textarea>
