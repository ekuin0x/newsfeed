                <textarea id="text" readonly> WWE Monday Night Raw airs from the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee. Survivor Series featured notable returns by R-Truth, Randy Orton, and CM Punk, generating excitement among fans. The anticipation for upcoming developments in the roster and an early start to the Royal Rumble buildup is palpable. You never know who will show up, and that includes Dixie Carter.

WWE RAW will air commercial-free this week for the first hour of WWE RAW. That should give them plenty of time to really secure a viewership tonight. With CM Punk scheduled to make his RAW return this week, it’s anyone’s guess how they will work him into things.

PW Insider reports that former TNA owner Dixie Carter is visiting at tonight’s Monday Night Raw. She is backstage for the show, because they are in her home city.

WWE Monday Night Raw comes to us live from the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee. So, Dixie Carter didn’t have to travel far to be at the show.

Dixie Carter played a significant role in the professional wrestling industry as the former President of TNA Wrestling, which later became Impact Wrestling. While she may not have been directly involved in the creative aspects of wrestling, her contributions to the business included many things that fans still remember as high points for TNA Wrestling that made them stand out as a unique company.

There is no confirmation that Dixie Carter will be on camera. Still, it is very interesting that she is going to be there. This will be a big night for RAW, because fans are also set to see the RAW return for Randy Orton and CM Punk.
