                <textarea id="text" readonly> Gio Reyna is not said to be considering a move away from Borussia Dortmund at the moment despite struggling for playing time at the club.

It has been a difficult season so far for Gio Reyna, who has struggled to get playing time at Borussia Dortmund. Despite showing glimpses of his quality whenever he has been used, the 21 year old has been limited to just 207 minutes on the pitch.

With his current contract set to expire at the end of next season, the coming months will be crucial in determining where his future lies.

According to Sky Sport, while Reyna is not happy with his lack of playing time at Borussia Dortmund, he is currently not thinking about making a move away from the club. The attacking midfielder has blocked all approaches for him from other clubs, as he wants to stay at BVB beyond the January transfer window and fight for his place in the team.

While Reyna has found it difficult to get playing time at Borussia Dortmund this season, he has made a big impact for the United States in recent games. He has now made four consecutive starts for the USMNT, and has found the back of the net on three occasions.

Gio Reyna stated in the summer that he is very happy at Borussia Dortmund. Even though he has found playing time hard to come by so far, the hope will be that the situation changes in the coming weeks with a number of crunch matches coming up for Edin Terzicâ€™s side. </textarea>
