If you thought the messy (at best) relationship between Prince Harry and his dad King Charles III was limited to jabs at one another, you’d be sorely (but perhaps not surprisedly) mistaken. According to a new book, Prince Harry really upped the ante when he brought more people into the crossfire: his children. Just like many parents, he used them as a bargaining chip when trying to reconcile things with his dad.

“Don’t you want to see your grandchildren?” he allegedly asked King Charles after being forced out of Frogmore Cottage — Prince Harry and wife Meghan Markle’s British home — earlier this year.

Prince Harry's Alleged Threat to King Charles Shows Bargaining Power

You might be thinking, why can’t Prince Harry grab an AirBNB and bring his kids to visit their 75-year-old grandfather in England? Well, there’s just not the necessary level of security like there was at Frogmore Cottage. So there’s nowhere for the family of four to go. Although, could you imagine renting your home to the Sussexes?!

“[The eviction was] a cheap shot from a wounded father bound by an institutional system that is often intolerant of human emotion,” author Omid Scobie said in his upcoming book Endgame.

Regardless of their relationship, Prince Archie will likely have to see his grandfather one more time in his life. Even though Archie’s parents are no longer senior members of the royal family, the young prince is considered sixth in line to the throne.

“The first six in line to the throne [must] ask permission from the monarch before they marry,” the Succession to the Crown Act states.

So even if King Charles continues to pass on the grandkid card, Archie has to get his blessing if he ever decides to get married. How do you like them [rotten] apples?!
