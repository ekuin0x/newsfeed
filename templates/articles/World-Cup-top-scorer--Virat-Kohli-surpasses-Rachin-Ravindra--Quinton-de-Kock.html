                <textarea id="text" readonly> Batting at an average of 99.00, Virat Kohli is now the leading run-getter of the ICC ODI World Cup 2023. The star Indian batter claimed the pole position in the table of the tournament's leading runscorers on Sunday as India clashed with bottom-placed Netherlands.

Batting at the home ground of his IPL side RCB, Virat Kohli made 51 runs from 56 deliveries against the Dutch to take his World Cup 2023 run tally to 594. This helped him to surpass South African opener Quinton de Kock (591) and Rachin Ravindra (565) to become the leading runscorer of the coveted tournament.

Indian captain Rohit Sharma and Australia's David Warner are in fourth and fifth positions with 503 and 499 runs respectively.

India vs Netherlands ICC ODI World Cup 2023: Innings report

KL Rahul produced a cracker of an innings which was the fastest hundred by an Indian in World Cup while Shreyas Iyer also lit up the Bengaluru sky with his unbeaten 128 that powered India to a mammoth 410 for four against Netherlands on the Diwali day, here Sunday.

Rahul's blitzkrieg and Iyer's stylish 94-ball knock combined well with fifties by Shubman Gill (51), Rohit Sharma (61) and Virat Kohli (51), leaving the Dutch to make a steepling chase after India batted by choice.

Collecting 122 runs in the last 10 overs, India also became the third team to post 400 in this tournament after South Africa and New Zealand. </textarea>
