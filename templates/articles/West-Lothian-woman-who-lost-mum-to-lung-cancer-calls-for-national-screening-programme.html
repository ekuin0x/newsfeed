A woman who lost her mother to lung cancer is backing calls for a national screening programme in Scotland, which a charity believes could save thousands of lives.

New statistics published by Cancer Research UK indicate that thousands of deaths from lung cancer in Scotland could be avoided if a national screening programme for the disease were to be introduced.

Kelsey Mackay, 31, is backing the call for targeted lung cancer screening to be introduced in Scotland.

Her mother, Christine Livingstone, who smoked all her adult life, was just 52 when she died from the disease at St John’s Hospital, Livingston, in September 2013.

Ms Mackay, said: “Lung cancer screening could save lives but it has come too late for my mum.

“The earlier cancer is detected the more successful the outcome is likely to be.

“I wish things could have turned out differently for my family.

“Mum was my best friend and I miss her every day.”

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in Scotland, claiming about 4,000 lives a year, the charity said.

The lung cancer death rate is also three times higher among those who live in Scotland’s most deprived areas, compared with those in the least deprived areas.

The UK National Screening Committee has recommended that all UK nations move towards implementing lung cancer screening to target those considered to be of high risk of developing lung cancer – people aged between 55 and 74 who either smoke or used to smoke.

Cancer Research UK chief executive Michelle Mitchell said: “Lung cancer is a tragedy for Scotland. More people die of lung cancer in Scotland than any other type of cancer. It is devastating for families and hits those who live in Scotland’s poorest communities very hard.

“A comprehensive commitment by the Scottish Government to implement a fully-funded national targeted lung cancer screening programme is a real chance to reduce the toll of lung cancer.”
