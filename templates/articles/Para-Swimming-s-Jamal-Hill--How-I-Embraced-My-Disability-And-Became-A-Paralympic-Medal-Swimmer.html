                <textarea id="text" readonly> My journey to becoming a Paralympic athlete started with a secret — a secret I carried for more than a decade. At the age of 10, I was diagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT), a hereditary neurological condition that affects my peripheral nerves, making simple tasks like walking and running challenging. For 12 years, I kept this diagnosis hidden, even from my closest friends, coaches and teammates. It was a point of shame and something I felt I had to overcome on my own.

When I was growing up, we never gave my diagnosis a name. We never wanted to give it power. If we don’t acknowledge it, it doesn’t exist, right? In the end, that made me tough.

But keeping that secret was isolating. When I would have shortcomings as an athlete, or just in general — I was always tripping, falling, breaking things, dropping things — I refused to blame it on my disease.

I didn’t want to make excuses, mostly because I feared that people wouldn’t believe me. It’s easy to look at someone who is missing a foot and see why they would have a hard time kicking a soccer ball — but the same can’t be said for me.

Silently bearing my secret, I persevered through the pain and the constant dread of discovery. I was terrified of being seen as different and therefore treated differently. I was able to hide my condition so well that I even earned a swimming scholarship to Hiram College in Northeast Ohio.

But in 2017, at the age of 22, I dropped out of college to pursue my dream of becoming a professional swimmer, with hopes of one day making it to the Olympics. I had never discussed my condition openly, nor had I accepted it as part of my identity. It was a secret I had locked away in a proverbial closet. </textarea>
