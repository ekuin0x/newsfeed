                <textarea id="text" readonly> The extradition of disgraced Terra (LUNA) founder Do Kwon to the US and South Korea has been approved by a court in Montenegro.

In a new press release, the Higher Court of Podgorica has ruled that the legal requirements needed for extraditing Kwon to the US and South Korea have been met.

“It was established that the legal prerequisites for the extradition of the citizen of the Republic of South Korea, the defendant KDH (Do Kwon), were met, at the request of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Korea dated March 29, 2023…

The same decision establishes that the legal prerequisites for the extradition of the same defendant have been met, at the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States of America.”

Kwon was initially arrested in Montenegro in late March after attempting to board a flight to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with a Costa Rican passport that was allegedly forged.

He was sentenced to four months in prison, but authorities in both the United States and South Korea wanted him extradited to face charges stemming from the $40 billion crash of the Terra ecosystem in 2022.

The Montenegrin court says that even though Kwon has given approval to be extradited, it still felt the need to make a ruling on the matter.

“In the explanation of the aforementioned decision, it was pointed out that the fact that the defendant KDH gave his consent to be extradited to the competent authorities of the Republic of South Korea under a shortened procedure, however, the High Court in Podgorica found that it should still be decided.”
