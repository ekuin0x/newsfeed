                <textarea id="text" readonly> Tiffany Haddish addressed her DUI incident during a comedy set Friday at the Laugh Factory in Long Beach, California.

Hours after the arrest, Haddish appeared at the club and spoke about her arrest that morning in Beverly Hills. She was allegedly found asleep at the wheel while the car engine was still running.

Audio obtained by TMZ has an audience member asking about her arrest.

“What happened last night?” Haddish said. “Ah, damn. You tell me. I don’t know.”

She then joked, “I prayed to God to send me a man with a job, preferably in a uniform.”

“God answered my prayers,” she said. “Because God believes in me.”

Haddish made a similar joke in the past.

She made a The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon appearance following her 2022 DUI arrest in Georgia.

“I can say this, Jimmy… I’ve been praying to God to send me a new man. A good man. And God went ahead and sent me four… in uniform,” Haddish told Fallon.

“And now I got a really great lawyer, and we’re going to work it out. I’ve got to get my asking of things to God a little better!” </textarea>
