                <textarea id="text" readonly> Ahead of the show’s final installment, Netflix has released the first look photos for “The Crown” Season 6, Part 2 giving fans a preview of newcomers Ed McVey and Meg Bellamy as they step into the roles of Prince William and Kate Middleton.

Picking up in the aftermath of Princess Diana’s untimely death, the finale follows Prince William (McVey), as he tries to integrate back into life at Eton as the monarchy has to ride the wave of public opinion. As she reaches her Golden Jubilee, the Queen (Imelda Staunton) reflects on the future of the monarchy with the marriage of Charles (Dominic West) and Camilla (Olivia Williams) and the beginnings of a new Royal fairytale in William and Kate (Bellamy). Part 1 followed the building romantic relationship between Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed, leading up to their untimely deaths.

Rufus Kampa previously played the younger version of Prince William in Part 1 alongside Fflyn Edwards, who plays Prince Harry in the previous installment. Luther Ford will portray the older version of Prince Harry in the forthcoming six episodes.

Additional cast this season includes Jonathan Pryce as Prince Philip, Lesley Manville as Princess Margaret, Dominic West as Prince Charles, Claudia Harrison as Princess Anne, Bertie Carvel as Tony Blair, Salim Daw as Mohamed Al Fayed and Khalid Abdalla as Dodi Fayed.

“The Crown” is created and written by Peter Morgan. Executive producers include Morgan, Suzanne Mackie, Andy Harries, Stephen Daldry, Matthew Byam Shaw and Robert Fox.

“The Crown” Season 6 Part 2 will premiere on Dec. 14.
