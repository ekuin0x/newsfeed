UPDATE: Nov. 26, 2023, 3:00 p.m. EST This post has been updated with the latest pricing and availability on unlocked phone deals.

There's always that one person at every holiday gathering who's desperately in need of a new phone. You know the type: Their screen is a spiderweb of cracks, they're always glued to an outlet because their clunker won't hold charge, or they're asking someone else to text them the group shots because theirs always come out blurry. Don't be that person.

Anyone due for an upgrade right now will have no trouble finding a deep Cyber Monday discount on an unlocked phone at major retailers like Amazon and Best Buy. (Going the unlocked route eliminates the hassle of needing to coordinate a trade-in or a new data plan.) Read on for a list of the best deals we've spotted so far, including markdowns on iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, Google Pixel, OnePlus, and Motorola models we've reviewed and loved:

Note: All newly added deals are marked with a âœ¨, while deals with a ðŸ”¥ have dropped to an all-time low price. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.

Note: The Apple Store will give you a free gift card worth up to $75 when you buy an iPhone 14, 13, or SE there through Nov. 27.
