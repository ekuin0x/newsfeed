It has an unusual white shiny, and gains the Dark typing that the Unovan Samurott doesn‚Äôt have. Hisuian Samurott made their debut in Pok√©mon Legends: Arceus on the Nintendo Switch. In Pok√©mon Legends: Arceus Oshawott could evolve into Dewott, and then into Hisuian Samurott, but in GO at present Hisuian Samurott will only be available from the raids. Their Legends Arceus Pok√©dex entry reads: ‚ÄòHard of heart and deft of blade, this rare form of Samurott is a product of the Pok√©mon‚Äôs evolution in the region of Hisui. Its turbulent blows crash into foes like ceaseless pounding waves.‚Äô Hisuian Samurott Shiny Hisuian Samurott </textarea>
