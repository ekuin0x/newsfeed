                <textarea id="text" readonly> Ubisoft is currently giving away the PC version of Assassin’s Creed Syndicate.

Players can claim a free copy of the game on Ubisoft Connect PC until December 6 at 1pm local time.

Assassin’s Creed Syndicate originally released in November 2015 and takes the series to London during the Industrial Revolution.

“As Jacob Frye, a young and reckless Assassin, use your skills to help those trampled by the march of progress,” says Ubisoft.

“From freeing exploited children used as slave labour in factories, to stealing precious assets from enemy boats, you will stop at nothing to bring justice back to London’s streets.”

The PC version of the game has a Metascore of 74 on review aggregation site Metacritic, based on 14 reviews.

The most recent series entry, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, was released in October for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC, with an iPhone 15 Pro version is set to follow in early 2024.

A week after its release, Ubisoft said the game was its biggest PS5 and Xbox Series X/S launch to date in terms of unit sales.

The company recently announced plans to close the online services for 10 more of its “older games”, including four Assassin’s Creed titles, in January 2024. </textarea>
