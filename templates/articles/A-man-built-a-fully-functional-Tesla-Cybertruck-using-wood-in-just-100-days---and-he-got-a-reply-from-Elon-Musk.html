While Tesla fans eagerly await the release of the Cybertruck later this month, a woodworker in Vietnam decided to make his own, fully-functional version of the truck using wood.

The man shared a video of the process, which he said took just 100 days, on his YouTube channel, ND-Woodworking Art.

After starting with a metal chassis, frame, and wheels, the woodworker added wooden panels, seats, and wheel trims. He also added working lights and even a light-up "X" logo on the door.

The creator also shared footage on X of the truck in action, complete with a wooden version of the Tesla Cyberquad in the trunk.

After the project was completed, the creator reached out to Elon Musk and Tesla to offer them his Cybertruck replica.

"I am a passionate content creator with a deep love for wooden vehicles and a tremendous admiration for both you and Tesla," he wrote in a post on X.

"I am aware that Tesla has faced its share of challenges in bringing the Cybertruck to fruition. However, I maintain unwavering faith in your vision and the capabilities of Tesla," the post continued. "I hope to have the honor of gifting this wooden Cybertruck to you and Tesla."

"Sure, much appreciated," Musk responded, adding a small heart emoji.

Deliveries of the real Tesla Cybertruck are set to begin on November 30 after two years of delays.

Tesla is still yet to release any official prices for the truck, but Musk recently told the Joe Rogan podcast that Tesla was aiming to eventually produce 200,000 Cybertrucks a year. </textarea>
