                <textarea id="text" readonly> Activists will likely continue staging their ongoing series of sporadic protests near the Chaman-Spin Boldak border crossing connecting Afghanistan and Pakistan through at least early December. In recent days, thousands of activists have staged various demonstrations, including sit-ins and road blockades, to denounce the Pakistani government's decision to limit cross-border travel to those with a valid passport and visa. As of Nov. 25, thousands of activists are continuing an indefinite sit-in protest along a major thoroughfare connecting Chaman and Quetta; the protest activity has resulted in renewed bilateral travel and shipping service disruptions. Protest organizers have previously threatened to continue to stage sit-in demonstrations until Pakistani authorities satisfy their demand to rescind the decision. Similar demonstrations could occur in Chaman and potentially spread to other areas. Potential gathering sites include police stations, government buildings, public squares, and thoroughfares. Well-attended gatherings will probably draw thousands of participants.

Authorities will almost certainly maintain an increased security presence near the impacted border crossing. Officials could impose enhanced security restrictions, including temporary border closures and/or public movement restrictions, depending on protest developments. Isolated security incidents, including small-scale bomb attacks, cannot be ruled out. Further transport disruptions are likely. Clashes between police and activists are possible. Localized business disruptions, including shipping delays, are possible if the civil unrest persists. </textarea>
