                <textarea id="text" readonly> Sebastian Kehl has denied claims that Borussia Dortmund could look to bring Jadon Sancho back to the club in the January transfer window.

Jadon Sancho is increasingly likely to leave Manchester United in the January transfer window after his row with manager Erik ten Hag that saw him get suspended from the first-team. Reports have surfaced in recent weeks claiming that Borussia Dortmund could offer the forward a route back to first-team football by making a loan move for him in January.

But Sebastian Kehl has denied those claims, saying that pursuing a move for Sancho is not an issue for them at the moment. The BVB sporting director told Sky Sport on Saturday that he was surprised by the rumours, adding that they have enough options in attack.

“It is not an issue at all at the moment,” Kehl said. “There is no contact. Nothing has been discussed or talked about. I was a bit surprised myself. We have enough options, at the moment we have a full squad.”

Jadon Sancho established himself as one of the most talented young wingers in the world during his time at Borussia Dortmund and registered 50 goals and 64 assists in 137 appearances for the club.

But a number of factors have prevented him from being able to replicate that since his move to Manchester United in 2021. Still only 23, Sancho will hope to secure a move away from the English Premier League side in January and join a club where he can get regular playing time and the opportunity to flourish. </textarea>
