                <textarea id="text" readonly> Kai Havertz’s 89th-minute goal off the bench saved toothless Arsenal and sent them atop the Premier League table with a 1-0 win at Brentford on Saturday in London.

The Gunners leap back into first following Manchester City’s 1-1 draw with Liverpool earlier in the day. The Gunners’ 30 points are one more than Man City and two clear of Liverpool.

As for the Bees, Thomas Frank’s men remain 11th on the table with 16 points on the season. Brentford has now dropped two Premier League matches since winning three on the spin.

The Gunners thought they’d scored when Leandro Trossard snapped home a Gabriel Jesus knockdown, but a long VAR review showed the Belgian to be just ahead of the ball.

Aaron Ramsdale was between the sticks for Arsenal and got a clean sheet that was not without nervy moments.

Depth players get Arsenal back atop the table (Odegaard helps, too)

This was one of those cliche games you need to win: Ugly, scrappy, and inspired by the bench.

While it’s funny for some to think of Aaron Ramsdale as a bench player, last year’s Arsenal starter is very much No. 2 to David Raya right now. With Raya unable to play against his parent club, Ramsdale fought through nerves and errors to keep a clean sheet across London.

But it will feel even better for Havertz, who has endured two mostly-rough spells with London clubs. His goal from in-tight, off the bench, was his second as a Gunner in Premier League play and came after an international break that saw him playing left wing back.

And while the depth show was great for Arsenal, it’s hardly a coincidence that Martin Odegaard returned to the midfield and joined Declan Rice in leading the midfield through the muck and mire.

Arsenal’s atop the table, and it’s earned it the hard way.

What’s next?

Arsenal turns it attention to sealing a Champions League knockout round spot with a draw or win against Lens at 3pm ET Wednesday. The Gunners have nine points, four more than PSV Eindhoven and Lens. They return to the Premier League to host Wolves at 10am ET Saturday (Dec. 2)

Brentford hosts Luton Town at the same time.

Kai Havertz goal video: Gunners break through late

Bukayo Saka assists are nothing new — he’s got five this season in the Premier League — but Kai Havertz goals have been rare.

So this is not just a welcome moment in that it sends Arsenal back atop the table, but it’s great because Havertz may find the confidence to get back to the form that’s helped him author many memorable moments between Chelsea and Bayer Leverkusen.

Havertz heads Arsenal 1-0 in front v Brentford Kai Havertz saves the day for the Gunners as he gets his head onto a far-post cross in the 89th minute to give Arsenal a 1-0 lead over Brentford at the Gtech.

Brentford vs Arsenal halftime analysis: 0-0

Well that was an adventure!

Arsenal seemed to go in front before halftime through Leandro Trossard but a length review showed that the Belgian’s foot was just in front of the ball when Gabriel Jesus nodded what looked to be a square pass his way.

The Gunners will feel they should be in front, out-attempting the hosts 8-3 with 69% possession, but they’ll also need to love up Aaron Ramsdale after the relief starter has been extremely nervy between the sticks.

Ramsdale does not have a save and has made multiple mistakes with the ball at his feet, which is the reason given for David Raya’s loan from Brentford and starting status.

Oh, no! Declan Rice bails out Aaron Ramsdale

Arsenal’s keeper is Aaron Ramsdale today, as David Raya is not allowed to play against parent club Brentford.

And there’s a huge gaffe from Ramsdale as he stalls and loses the ball in his feet after a quick pass back.

One shot is blocked by Declan Rice on the goal line while Brentford fails to put the rebound on frame and the Gunners’ goalkeeper is off the hook.

Yeesh!

Arsenal team news, injuries

The Gunners won’t have David Raya due to his loan from the Bees, so Aaron Ramsdale will make a scrutinized start between the sticks. The statuses of Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Jesus will be the most sought when the lineup’s released by Mikel Arteta.
