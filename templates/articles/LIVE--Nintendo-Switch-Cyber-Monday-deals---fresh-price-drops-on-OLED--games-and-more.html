Walmart's wild ride on its Nintendo Switch OLED sale continues into Cyber Monday - the price $305.99 yesterday but has now dropped again to an eye-catching $299.01 (a $49.99 saving). This is the newer OLED model that we love, and its rare to find any discount outside of a games bundle. Get Nintendo Switch OLED for $299.01 at Walmart

It's Cyber Monday 2023 and, well… there's an offer on The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. The update of the classic role-playing game, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition is $69.99 $34.99 at the Nintendo Store. This is the only place you find the game for sale on Switch, and all joking aside, Skyrim is a true classic and remains fun. The Nintendo-focused Anniversary Edition features new Creation Club content, plus all three official expansions - Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn.

(Image credit: Nintendo) If you're still hooked on Pokémon Go! after all these years then Nintendo has something for you, the Pokémon GO Plus + do-dad that can be used with the app to capture Pokémon's in a more physical way. There's a small discount at Amazon, get the Pokémon GO Plus + for $54.99 $50.99 or head to the Nintendo store. The Pokémon GO Plus + gadget is also a health monitor that can track your sleep patterns and resting health. It also acts as a night light and there's even your very own Pikachu hiding inside to sing to sleep. Great for kids and adults who love shrill lullabies. Pokémon GO Plus +: $54.99 $50.99

(Image credit: FaSonyke / Voyee / Manba) If, like me, you're used to playing on more traditional video controllers then you'll want to upgrade your standard Switch Joy Con for a pro gamepad when playing Nintendo Switch hooked up to a TV. Below are the best and most eye-catching Nintendo Switch controller deals I've found this Cyber Monday. (My personal favourite is the FaSonyke, not least because of that cheeky name but also because its design is just so, well… wild.) Manba Switch Controller: $29.99 $23.99 VOYEE Switch Controller: $22.99 $15.99 FaSonyke Wireless Switch Pro Controller: $22.99 $11.49

(Image credit: Nintendo) Nintendo Switch OLED is an amazing console, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is one of the best games for the console, get both in this Amazon bundle for $349. The best part? the offer also includes a three month Nintendo Switch Online membership - which actually includes a whole bunch of free classic Nintendo games. Nintendo Switch OLED + Super Smash Bros. Ultimate bundle: $417 $349

(Image credit: Nintendo) Hey-o, this is Ian stepping for a bit. I'm CB's Editor, Digital Art & 3D and a massive gamer - in a past life I edited Official PlayStation Magazine (but don't hold that against me Ninty fans, I also own a Switch, NES, SNES and GameCube). So, what's good today? There's a tiny 2% off The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom at Amazon, which is kind of laughable. But if you do want to pick up Nintendo's best game, there are some good deals I've found, including £15 off at Very. The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom: £59.99 £47.99 at Very

(Image credit: ivoler/Amazon) And now for some very sexy deal news. Grrrrrr. Yes, it's all about screen protectors. If you have a Switch, you know it's made to be portable. And anything made to be carried will also, inevitably, fall or slide or hit something. And then you want something to protect that precious, precious screen. Well, my dear, beloved Switch-deal-hunting reader, I've got good news. The well-reviewed ivoler (not a typo, the branding is all lowercase) screen protector is a very sexy 47% off for Cyber Monday on Amazon US, or only $8.47, down from its list price of $15.99. Our tracking puts this slightly below the lowest-ever price we've seen before, which was $8.95, so if you want to make sure that Switch screen stays as crack- and scratch-free as possible, now's the time to do something about it, I say.

(Image credit: Hot Wheels) I really like Hot Wheels Unleashed. And my 7-year-old kid loves it. And that means I have to make sure he doesn't see this update. Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is still discounted through Cyber Monday on Currys in the UK. The recently released game has been dropped by a solid 15 quid to £29.99 (was £44.99). And if you're in the US, happy days. Amazon has also knocked 15 dollarydoos off it, so instead of $49.99, you'll only have to pay $34.99 for your child's eternal gratitude (or, y'know, some arcade-style racing fun).

(Image credit: EA) Hi, this is Erlingur, the Tech Reviews Editor of your dreams (and the Creative Bloq site), taking over this blog for the next hour or so. I'm very intrigued by the EA Sports FC 24 game. Not just because the guy on the cover shares my first name, but also because this is the first post-FIFA-deal game from EA Sports, so I've been worrying it might struggle. However, reviews have indicated that it's done the opposite, and breathed a fresh new life into the famous football game (that's soccer for you, American colonials). And I'm happy to report it's still handsomely discounted on both sides of the pond! In the UK, you can grab EA Sports FC 24 for £29.99 at Currys (was £49.99), and in the US, the proportional discount is even better, or a hair over half price off at Best Buy, now $29.99 (was $59.99). And you get someone named Erling on the cover too. It's not me, though, unfortunately, just some Norwegian bloke...

Right now in the UK, one of the best Switch bundle deals is from Smyths Toys. Get either one of the excellent Super Mario Bros games, and the Switch console, for only £279.99, down from £300. Not bad at all! </textarea>
