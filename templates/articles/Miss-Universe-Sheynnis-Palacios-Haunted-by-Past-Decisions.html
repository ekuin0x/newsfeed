                <textarea id="text" readonly> When Nicaraguan Sheynnis Palacios won the 72nd annual Miss Universe pageant last week in San Salvador, El Salvador, it was seen by many as a great moment for Central American representation on the world stage. Nicaragua's president, Daniel Ortega, said the win, a first for the country, brought "legitimate joy and pride."

Those warm feelings — which included public celebrations in the street — have cooled following the discovery that the 23-year-old took part in a series of controversial demonstrations against the current regime while a student in 2018.

As the Associated Press has noted, Palacios' win and old social media photos of her engaged in protests, have been championed by those in opposition to Ortega and his party. Rev. Silvio Báez, an exiled priest, wrote "Thank you for bringing joy to our long-suffering country! Thank you for giving us hope for a better future for our beautiful country!"

In a social media post of her own, Rosario Murillo, who is both the vice president and first lady of Nicaragua, wrote "In these days of a new victory, we are seeing the evil, terrorist commentators making a clumsy and insulting attempt to turn what should be a beautiful and well-deserved moment of pride into destructive coup-mongering."

The 78-year-old Ortega has been a leading member of the FSLN or Sandinista party since the late 1970s. In recent years they have outlawed over 3,000 civic groups and deported many in political opposition while seizing their assets. The AP reports that 355 people were killed by government forces during 2018's demonstrations.

The Miss Universe Pageant dates back to 1952, but a previous pageant, the "International Pageant of Pulchritude," would dub its winner "Miss Universe."

In 1996, Donald Trump bought the rights to the annual event and owned it until 2015. In recent years, some competitors complained about how the real estate developer and eventual President of the United States would regularly hang around the changing areas. In 2022, it was purchased by the transgender Thai businesswoman Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip, who also owns the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants. </textarea>
