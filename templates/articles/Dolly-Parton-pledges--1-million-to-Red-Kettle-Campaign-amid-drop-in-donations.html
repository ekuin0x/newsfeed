                <textarea id="text" readonly> ARLINGTON, Texas (WKRC/KOLO/CNN Newsource) - The Salvation Army's 133rd Red Kettle Campaign received a massive contribution soon after launching for the season.

The campaign kicked off with a halftime performance by music legend Dolly Parton Thursday during the Dallas Cowboys vs. Washington Commanders game at AT&T Stadium.

"I am so proud to have kicked off the giving season with my Red Kettle Kickoff performance!" the superstar . "Every dollar you give to @SalvationArmyUS helps your neighbors in need during the holidays and all year long."

Salvation Army officials say Red Kettle donations have dipped in recent years, reaching $102 million in 2022, versus $126 million in 2019.



This may be due to continuing financial struggles from the pandemic and rising inflation, as well as the fact that less people carry cash.

To lend a hand, Parton -- an avid philanthropist and author -- pledged a whopping $1 million to the cause.

“Dolly’s contagious energy and positive spirit are just what we need to support The Salvation Army’s enormous effort to make this holiday bright for millions of individuals and families in need,” , executive vice president and chief brand officer for the Dallas Cowboys and former national advisory board chairperson for The Salvation Army.



The Salvation Army via cash, checks, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, and Venmo. You can also donate goods. </textarea>
