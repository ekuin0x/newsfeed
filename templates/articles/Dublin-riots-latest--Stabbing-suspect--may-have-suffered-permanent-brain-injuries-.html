The suspect in the Dublin nursery stabbing which sparked violent riots in Ireland’s capital has suffered “extensive” brain injuries which “may be permanent”, it has been claimed.

An Garda Siochana did not comment on claims by a source who told the Irish Mirror that the suspect “is in a bad way”, adding: “His head injuries are extensive and may be permanent.”

It comes as the five-year-old girl who was stabbed remains in critical condition at CHI Temple Street, while the children’s care assistant, a woman aged in her 30s, is in a serious but stable condition in The Mater Hospital.

Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald insisted on Monday that justice minister Helen McEntee and Garda Commissioner Drew Harris’s positions were “untenable”, warning that “we now have a scenario where people do not feel safe in parts of Dublin's inner city”.

Ireland’s further education minister Simon Harris pledged that there would be a “full review” of the policing of the riots which engulfed parts of central Dublin on Thursday, which he condemned as “absolute opportunistic criminality and thuggery”. </textarea>
