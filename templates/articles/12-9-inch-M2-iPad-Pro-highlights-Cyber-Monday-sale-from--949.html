                <textarea id="text" readonly> It’s Cyber Monday, and that means a fresh batch of discounts on all things Apple. Headlining the best offers today, Apple’s 12.9-inch M2 iPad Pro now starts from $949 to go alongside a new all-time low on the companion Apple Pencil 2 at $80. And if you don’t mind going with a previous-generation device, Apple’s 16-inch M1 Max MacBook Pros are now $1,400 off or more. Hit the jump for all that and more in the latest 9to5Toys Lunch Break.

Apple’s 12.9-inch M2 iPad Pro now starts from $949

We’re now finally tracking some Cyber Monday savings on Apple’s latest 12.9-inch M2 iPad Pro. The deals have been light on the flagship end of the iPadOS lineup as of late, and now B&H is cutting it close by offering up some savings at the last minute. Kicking things off, the Wi-Fi 128GB model sells for $999, down from its usual $1,099 price tag. Best Buy members can drop it down to $949. This is the first price cut in a couple of months and matches the all-time low in the process from back in September. There’s also a bit of a pattern as the rest of the lineup is also $100 off.

Apple’s latest flagship iPadOS experience comes powered by the new M2 chip and backed by an 8-core CPU with a 10-core GPU. The latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro delivers all of the high-end features we’ve come to expect from the form factor, with a 12.9-inch Liquid Retina XDR display being complemented by ProMotion for smooth scrolling, True Tone for adjusting the tint to your surroundings, and P3 wide color support so all of your content looks as accurate as it should. Taking full advantage of the M2 chip is a Thunderbolt port, as well as Apple Pencil 2 connectivity and support for the new hover feature.

New all-time low drops Apple Pencil 2 down to $80

If the Black Friday pricing wasn’t quite enough to sway you into scoring Apple Pencil 2, the Cyber Monday savings should be. Right now, via Amazon, you can score the most capable iPad stylus in Apple’s arsenal for $79.99 shipped. It drops from the usual $129 price tag in order to save you $49. This is a new all-time low, clocking in at $9 under our previous mention. Did we mention that it’s also just $9 more than the new USB-C charging version, making the wireless-enabled model an even better value?

Apple Pencil 2 is far more compelling than just being used to make digital art, excelling as a note-taking tool on top of offering more precise input than your fingers. There’s a new hover feature that just rolled out for the M2 iPad Pros, and the accessory will snap right onto the side of your device to charge and for storage. It’s compatible with everything from the more affordable iPad Air 5 to the Pro models and even Apple’s compact iPad mini.

Apple’s 16-inch M1 Max MacBook Pros $1,400+ off

Apple’s M1 Max MacBook Pro might not be the company’s latest, but it certainly is still one of the greatest releases out there. Right now, B&H is marking down the higher-end configuration 16-inch MacBook Pro through the end of the day. The 16-inch 1TB/32GB model clocks in at $2,099. That’s a massive $1,400 off the original $3,499 price tag and an extra $300 below any other discount we’ve seen in the past. If you’re not entirely sold on the performance improvements from the newer M2 and M3 Pro/Max chips, then it’s hard to beat going with such a deep clearance discount.

Apple’s previous-generation flagship MacBook Pro may not be the most recent release, but it still arrives with much of the same refreshed form factor as the newer models. The M1 Max chip starts the improved form factor and powers the experience, which comes centered around a 16-inch Liquid Retina XDR Display backed by ProMotion, 120Hz refresh rates, and 1600 nits of peak brightness. Packed into that new chassis is up to 21-hour battery and a new array of I/O like the return of MagSafe charging, HDMI, three Thunderbolt ports, and more. So if you’re not sold on the performance gains of the new M2 iteration, today’s price cut is easily worth considering. See why it was previously our Apple product of the year.

Beats Studio Buds+ hit $120

We’re now tracking a new all-time low on the Beats Studio Buds+ at Amazon. Dropping down to $120, you can now save $50 on the Cosmic Silver earbuds. We didn’t see a chance to save go live over Black Friday, and now with Cyber Monday almost here you can actually lock-in some worthwhile savings. This is an extra $10 below our previous mention and the best discount yet. We’re still waiting for all of the colorways to go on sale – including that slick new transparent design – but if you’re not too picky on the design, you can lock-in that new all-time low.

Beats Studio Buds+ just launched back in May and arrive as the latest listening experience from Beats. Notable features include improved ANC and transparency modes, which are complemented by upgraded microphones and the slick designed build. There’s 36 hours of listening for good measure, and everything else you can read about in our hands-on review.

If you’ve been waiting on an Apple TV 4K discount, here’s one for $115

If you’ve been waiting for a discount this past week on Apple TV 4K, Cyber Monday finally has you covered. Right now, Woot is offering the previous-generation Apple TV 4K 64GB for $115. Delivery will run you $6 otherwise. Today’s offer amounts to $64 from its original price tag, and is an all-around rare chance to save, period. The newer Apple TV 4K by comparison sells for $129, but lacks the Ethernet jack found on the discounted model today. Get a closer look in our hands-on coverage.

This might not be the latest tvOS package, but the Apple TV 4K from last year still delivers some notable features for renovating the home theater at this price. Powered by the A12 Bionic chip, you’ll be able to enjoy 4K HDR playback with Dolby Vision over the HDMI 2.1 port with Wi-Fi 6 pairing with Ethernet connectivity. There’s of course all of the usual access to all of the popular streaming services, as well as Apple Arcade and Thread smart home support. Not to mention, the new display calibration feature that ensures content looks its best. Plus, you’re also getting the redesigned Siri Remote, as well.
