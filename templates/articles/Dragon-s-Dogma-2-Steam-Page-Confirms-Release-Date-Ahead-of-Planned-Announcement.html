                <textarea id="text" readonly> Dragon's Dogma 2's Steam page has revealed the game's March 22, 2024 release date ahead of a planned announcement later tonight.

The release date visible on the Dragon's Dogma 2 Steam page confirms a recent leak spotted earlier this month in which the PEGI rating for the game revealed it would release on March 22, 2024, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! Welcome to 20 questions. Can you guess the game?

The news comes hours before the Dragon's Dogma 2 showcase, set for 1pm PT / 4pm ET. The showcase will be co-hosted by Dragon's Dogma 2's director, Hideaki Itsuno, and producer, Yoshiaki Hirabayashi. The pair will present new info, gameplay, and the release date. The stream will run for approximately 15 minutes.

Dragon's Dogma 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the original Dragon's Dogma, which launched in 2012. Before today's stream, Cacom has not shared much information on what to expect. What we do know, however, is that Dragon's Dogma 2's map is four times the size of the original's.

"Dragon's Dogma 2 will offer up more of what we loved about that first game, and many of those minor elements have been improved upon. We couldn't help but wish we walked away a little more excited about something new in the sequel, though," my colleague Mitchell Saltzman said in his preview.
