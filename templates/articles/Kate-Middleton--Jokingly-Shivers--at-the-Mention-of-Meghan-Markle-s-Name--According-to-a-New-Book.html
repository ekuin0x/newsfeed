                <textarea id="text" readonly> Meghan Markle is still reportedly receiving the cold shoulder from Kate Middleton, quite literally.



According to a new book titled Endgame: Inside the Royal Family and the Monarchy's Fight for Survival, written by royal biographer Omid Scobie, the Princess of Wales has a visceral reaction upon the mention of Meghan's name. Per Scobie, Kate has "jokingly shivered" and "giggled" when the Duchess of Sussex is brought up in conversation, adding that the royal has "spent more time talking about Meghan… than with Meghan."

He further claimed that the two have had "almost zero direct communication" for four years. The sister-in-law's relationship first turned icy after reports emerged that Meghan made Kate cry during a bridesmaid dress fitting for Princess Charlotte ahead of her 2018 wedding to Prince Harry (Meghan later claimed the reverse happened), and, apparently, the two have barely spoken since then with the exception of "short pleasantries."

Scobie went on to quote someone who has worked with Middleton as saying: "She can be cold if she doesn't like someone," revealing that she was "never a fan" of Meghan.



It goes without saying that there's little hope for a reconciliation between Meghan and Kate. And surprisingly, the same is true for the future of Kate and Harry's relationship, according to Scobie's reporting. “She was close to Harry, and she will always look back fondly on those moments… and the relationship he had with their children," a source close to the family said in the book. "But to her there is no way she could ever trust them after all their interviews." </textarea>
