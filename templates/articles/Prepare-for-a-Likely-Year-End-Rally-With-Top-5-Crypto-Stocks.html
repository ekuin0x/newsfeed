                <textarea id="text" readonly> The cryptocurrency space has regained momentum in November buoyed by several positives. Recently, this space has been ripe with speculation that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Once again, the news raised investors’ optimism. A plethora of recent crypto industry legal victories is likely spurring investor confidence.

The expected approval of a Bitcoin ETF by the SEC is likely to boost demand by providing traditional investors with a pathway to access Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through regular stock markets.

The largest thrust for the crypto space has come from institutional investors. BlackRock Inc.’s (BLK) decision to launch a Bitcoin ETF and the decision of The Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW)-led consortium to create a new crypto exchange called EDX Markets, have attracted several investors toward cryptocurrencies.

The latest addition to this league is PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL), which has become the first major U.S. fintech company to offer its own crypto token with a dollar-pegged stablecoin known as PayPal USD.

PayPal USD is designed to contribute to the opportunity that stablecoins offer for payments and is 100% backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries and similar cash equivalents. PayPal USD is redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars and is issued by Paxos Trust Company.

Moreover, the next Bitcoin Halving will occur in the first half of 2024. When a halving occurs, the reward for mining new blocks is halved, making it more challenging for miners to earn net Bitcoins. Historically, this event has led to increased scarcity and has driven up the value of Bitcoin due to reduced supply.

As a result, prices of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB) are expected to remain buoyant for the rest of 2023.
