                <textarea id="text" readonly> Even in a league full of improvisation, the Carolina Panthers have had to do a lot on the fly this season. And now, they’ll have to take flight without another key player.

On Wednesday, the team announced that they have placed starting right guard Austin Corbett on injured reserve. The setback, which Corbett himself attributed as an MCL injury, will keep the sixth-year offensive lineman out for the remainder of the campaign.

After practice, head coach Frank Reich was asked about Corbett’s absence opening up chances for their other hog mollies.

“It’s a great opportunity for these young guys,” he said. “And in some ways, it is a fresh slate. These guys are gonna get an opportunity to play. So we have a plan in place now with Austin down on how we’ll move forward, and you guys will see how that all unfolds over the week.”

Reich was then asked if he was willing to reveal said plan.

“I really don’t wanna say that at this point,” he replied.

Corbett’s season-ending injury now leaves the Panthers without its two usual starting guards. Brady Christensen, who has also been shelved for the rest of the year, had his 2023 cut short after Week 1 due to a biceps injury.

Carolina currently has three other interior linemen on their active roster—Cade Mays, Nash Jensen and Brett Toth. They’re also carrying J.D. DiRenzo and Justin McCray, who was brought back this afternoon, on their practice squad.
