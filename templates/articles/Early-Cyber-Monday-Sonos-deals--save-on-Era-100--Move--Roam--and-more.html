From the stylish and portable Roam speaker to the sleek and compact Beam soundbar, we're huge fans of the extensive audio collection Sonos has to offer. One thing we're not so fond of, though, is the extravagant pricing.

Sonos, like other high quality brands (think Apple or Dyson), rarely offers sales. Cyber Weekend is one of the only exceptions. So, needless to say, we've had our eyes peeled for deals on Sonos speakers, soundbars, and other audio systems. While Walmart and Best Buy have sweet discounts on some of our favorite Sonos speakers, the best place to snag a Sonos deal is â€” drumroll, please â€” at Sonos' own website.

Below, we've rounded up the best of the best early Cyber Monday Sonos deals that are live. Check back regularly â€” we'll be updating the list as any new deals roll in.

Note: All newly added deals are marked with a âœ¨, while deals with a ðŸ”¥ have dropped to an all-time low price. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.

Early Cyber Monday Sonos speaker deals

Why we like it

Just released earlier this year, this is the first discount ever for the Sonos Era 100. The Era 100 is a direct replacement for the Sonos One, which is no longer in the official Sonos lineup. While it looks similar to the One, the Era 100 is slightly taller, has refreshed controls on top with a capacitive volume control and a new button to turn off the voice assistant. Not to mention â€” and this is the kicker â€” it has two tweeters and can produce a stereo sound on its own, unlike its predecessor. Unfortunately, it doesn't offer spatial audio, though. You'll need the Era 300 for that, which is $200 more. Save $50 for Black Friday and snag the Sonos Era 100 for just under $200 at Sonos or Best Buy.
