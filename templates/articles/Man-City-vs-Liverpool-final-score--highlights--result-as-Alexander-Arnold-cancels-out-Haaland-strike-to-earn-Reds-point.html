                <textarea id="text" readonly> ETIHAD STADIUM, MANCHESTER â€” Trent Alexander-Arnold fired home a brilliant equaliser as Liverpool snatched a 1-1 draw away to Premier League champions Manchester City.

Darwin Nunez forced a fine save from Ederson with a glancing header but it was Pep Guardiola's side who struck first through Erling Haalandâ€™s 50th Premier League goal.

The Norway superstar has reached his latest landmark in a record-breaking 48 appearances, but his strike owned much to Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson losing his footing when making a clearance.

Panic spread through a disorganised Liverpool backline as Nathan Ake picked his way through the traffic and fed Haaland for a shot that squirmed through Alisson's gloves and into the bottom-right corner.

Phil Foden fired just wide before halftime and Julian Alvarez blasted wastefully over from Jeremy Doku's 53rd-minute cutback.

Alisson had a reprieve when Ruben Dias netted from a 68th-minute corner, with Manuel Akanji adjudged to have fouled him in the goalmouth.

The Liverpool goalkeeper produced the best moment of an uneven display 11 minutes from time when he denied Haaland from close range and it proved crucial.

Jurgen Klopp's side broke up the other end, Mohamed Salah passed to Alexander-Arnold and a clever run from substitute Cody Gakpo opened up space for the England international to fizz a wonderful shot low to Ederson's right from just inside the box.

Record man Haalands shatters latest landmark

When the post-Christmas blues hit next year and you're idly trying to entertain yourself, be wary of silly ideas. During the early months of January 2023, there was a growing strand of opinion that Manchester City were in fact worse off with Haaland in the team. The goals returned by the bucketful but purists of the Guardiola-ista school would point out that City's 4-1 win in this fixture last season came with the big Norwegian sidelined.

Haaland certainly played like a man with a point to prove, visibly fired up from kickoff. His penalty-box work and movement around the danger area is indisputably brilliant, but the 23-year-old made his mark in different ways amid an often fractured game that lacked the usual flow of encounters between these two clubs.

He stormed into midfield to win a second ball when the game was goalless and a sometimes subdued home crowd responding by howling his name. Shortly afterwards, he did what he does best, obliterating Andy Cole's previous best mark of reaching 50 Premier League goals in 65 appearances.

Is Trent Alexander-Arnold good at defending?

Much like Haaland, there is no disputing what Alexander-Arnold does better than most of his peers. The Liverpool hero is blessed with a wand of a right foot and there are few players as eloquent with the ball at their feet. His equalising goal was a prime example.

However, when the teamsheets dropped, a fair few observers giddily anticipated a bloodbath. Alexander-Arnold's frequently wayward defending would be subjected to the electrifying talents of Jeremy Doku. The full-time statistics showed the City winger completed a remarkable 11 take-ons over the course of the contest, although Liverpool would retort that this did not yield an assist.

Sometimes this was more by accident than design, but Doku also seemed to find most joy when running at right-sided central defender Joel Matip or various midfielders roped in to stem the tide. The task at hand appeared to sharpen Alexander-Arnold's defensive senses, as his jousts with Leroy Sane in this fixture did half a decade ago.

"He played a really good game, he was super influential. In his moments with Doku, he was really strong," Klopp said. "You can see how difficult it is against him. He's a really good dribbler. Trent was pretty influential in a good way."

Can Liverpool win the Premier League?

When Liverpool limped to fifth place last season and Klopp proceeded to rip out and refit his entire midfield, it didn't really seem credible to imagine they'd be a point off top spot with a solitary, chaotic defeat to their name. And yet, here we are.

"We've been through a lot of tough moments his season already and coming here today was a tough one," Klopp said. "Preparing the toughest game of the season in just one session is really difficult. Maybe we needed the first half to understand a bit more in the details. We scored a goal."

Like his manager, Alexander-Arnold was under no illusions over the quality of Liverpool's performance. But Pep Guardiola's Labrador-like enthusiasm over his own side repeating their unhelpful recent habit of giving away leads was instructive. The City boss is no stranger to hilariously over-egging things during excitable post-match news conferences, but he returned time and again to a recurrent thought.

"We know the team we play, for the last seven years," he said. As far as Guardiola is concerned, this is not a new Liverpool; it's a continuation, and the latest reinvention of the formidable Klopp era. Expect them to be in the fight when the run-in comes around.



Man City vs. Liverpool live updates, highlights, commentary

Man City vs. Liverpool: Second-half commentary

Fulltime: Diaz with a late opening in the City box. He heads it up in the air, Ederson claims and that's that. City drop points for the second game in succession and there's a bit of an opening for Arsenal, who can leapfrog both of these teams with victory in today's late kickoff against Brentford. It think we have a title race, folks. Guardiola and Klopp have one of those big chatty hugs that annoys yer da'. Thanks for joining us.

90th minute+8: Haaland! Glances wide. Alvarez's deliveries haven't be consistent today but that was bang on the money.

90th minute+7: City with some sustained, calculated pressure. They don't want to leave themselves exposed to Liverpool on the break. Doku spins around Elliott, Dias - what's he doing there - tries to convert and it's a corner.

90th minute+5: Doku tees up Bernardo Silva, who shoots! Bodies everywhere! Liverpool survive.

90th minute: There will be eight minutes of added time. Doku is shown down a blind ally by Alexander-Arnold and it's a goalkick.

88th minute: Rodri looks to get City away on the counter but referee Kavanagh stops play because Akanji is down. His teammates are furious. I'm sure he won't take it personally. Walker talks himself into a yellow card. Again, no offence, Manu.

87th minute: Alvarez's in-swinger is headed behind for a City corner. Here are Alisson and Akanji again. The City defender bundles the Liverpool goalkeeper into the net Nat Lofthouse style. A goal in the 1950s, but not today.

85th minute: Doku dribbling, ducking and diving wins a free-kick from Alexander-Arnold right on the edge of the Liverpool box.

85th minute: Klopp looks to shore things up with his final two changes as Elliott and Endio replace Nunez and Mac Allister. Guardiola still yet to turn to his bench.

84th minute: Doku cuts inside and shoots into a packed area. His shot is blocked. That didn't really feel like the percentage play.

83rd minute: Alvarez's hot hits the top of the wall.

82nd minute: Akanji draws Diaz into a bit of a silly one. City free-kick in a good position.

80th minute: GOOOOOAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!!!! Alexander-Arnold!!!!!

Oh and how huge! Liverpool head up the other end. Salah on the ball. Gakpo's decoy run creates room outside the box for Alexander-Arnold. Enough room for him to absolutely cream one into the bottom corner. Brilliant strike.

79th minute: Incredible save from Alisson!!! Doku gets to the byline cuts the ball into the six yard box and Haaland looks certain to score from close range. He's not had his best day but that's huge.

78th minute: Liverpool break, the ball hits the referee. Everyone is amused. Sort of.

76th minute: Beauty of a delivery but Haaland can't keep his near-post header down.

75th minute: Foden mowed down on the right. Alvarez over the free-kick.

73rd minute: Gakpo on for Szoboszlai. Liverpool will not die wondering.

72nd minute: Salah and Nunez combine and the latter is denied at the near post by Ederson, who then claims the resulting corner with authoritative ease. It's been quite the contrast from the two Brazil goalkeepers today.

70th minute: Alvarez sends in a free-kick that Rodri heads over. He should have done better there. Not the first time we've said that in a game where the end product hasn't been as you'd expect.

69th minute: VAR DECISION: NO GOAL. There wasn't a lot of contact but the replay shows Akanji had hold of Alisson's arm, which might have prevented him from catching the ball. Alternatively, he's just having a bit of a stinker. Either way, it's fair to give a foul.

68th minute: Alisson goes up to claim it, doesn't get the ball under pressure from Akanji. Dias puts the ball into the net. A foul is given but that looked soft.

67th minute: Doku gets Matip in his sights. His low delivery is cleared behind for another corner.

65th minute: For the first time today, Doku definitively skins Alexander-Arnold. The ball breaks to Rodri. Is that handball? No the shot hit Van Dijk on the bottom and it's a corner. Alvarez's in-swinger comes to nought.

64th minute: Foden curls to the back post. Silva and Doku aren't going to get there.

61st minute: Another Liverpool corner. They're knocking louder on the door. Matip gets up to met it but it's a simple Ederson save.

59th minute: Ake with an excellent challenge on Nunez. He wants a goalkick and replays show he might have a point but it's a Liverpool corner from the right. The ball pops around a bit until Foden mashes a clearance into the sky. That might not have been too far away from the plane.

57th minute: Haaland heads away a Liverpool corner at the near post to the soundtrack of a light aircraft. There's an Everton protest banner in town.

55th minute: The diminutive Silva startles everyone by throwing himself towards a header in the Liverpool box. Haaland can't get on top of the bouncing ball and slices way over.

54th minute: Double change for Liverpool, with Ryan Gravenberch and Luis Diaz coming on for Jones and Diogo Jota. The latter appears to be injured. Klopp has a deeper bench by all accounts. Will that count for something?

53rd minute: Should be 2-0!!! Doku scoots past Mac Allister and cuts back to Alvarez. It's on the Argentina forward's weaker left foot but he lifts over from inside the box when he should do much, much better.

52nd minute: Ederson pouches it superbly. His throw is wayward though and Liverpool have it back.

51st minute: Bit of a sleepy start to the second period. Alexander-Arnold looking to change that and wins a corner.

46th minute: We go again! No changes for either side at the break.

Man City vs. Liverpool: First-half commentary

Halftime: City get involved in a palava of their own making in their own goal mouth but survive. The hosts are deserving of their lead but there's been plenty of errors. About six led to Haaland's goal, with Alisson the main culprit. We'll see you back here shortly.

45th minute: Foden, cutting inside onto his left and that is juuust past the post. There'll be one minute of stoppage time. How old-fashioned.

43rd minute: Dias throws himself into a challenge on Nunez, the ball cannons back off the Liverpool man and it's a goal kick. Nunez wants a corner. Pull the other one, mate.

42nd minute: City ambling dangerously towards half time and Szoboszlai's cross narrowly evades Diogo Jota. Doku's had quite enough of all that, collects Silva'a pass and is on his bike. Haaland to his left, Alvarez to his right. He goes right and the Argentine's effort is right in that no-man's land between cross and a shot.

41st minute: Nunez looks to be through again before that incredibly modern feature of the comedically late offside flag.

35th minute: Akanji's blushes are spared. The Switzerland international duffs a pass straight to Szoboszlai inside his own half. The Liverpool midfielder feeds Nunez but Ederson closes the angle expertly and the No. 9 can only shoot tamely into the side netting.

34th minute: Massive shout for handball against Nunez. Referee Kavanagh taps his shoulder to signal play on and where he thought it struck the striker. Hmmmmm. Anyway, here's Salah and Ake stands up to him superbly. Liverpool win a corner and Ederson punches the inswinger clear under glaring winter sunshine.

32nd minute: Doku cutting inside with intent. It's electric inside here every time he gets the ball. Shot deflected behind for another City corner. Liverpool deal with this one, Alisson doesn't fall over and all is normal.

27th minute: GOOOOOAAAALLLLLL!!!!!! Erling Haaland!!!!!

Told you he was fired up. Alisson falls over when clearing out of his hands, which is a delightfully Sunday League sight unless you're a Liverpool fan. Ake picks up the pieces, turns into Roberto Carlos to shimmy through a few challenges, feeds Haaland and... well, should Alisson do better there too? He gets a touch but the ball squirms into the bottom right corner.

26th minute: Doku... Rodri...Alvarez! None of them manage to get a shot away! But City do have a left-wing corner. Headed behind for another on the right.

24th minute: Tsimikas pressed all the way into the City six-yard box then before taking ample time to get back into position. The hosts were unable to pick out Foden in the meantime, but Van Dijk probably has some thoughts.

22nd minute: Akanji, in that hybrid defender/midfielder role, marauds forward but gets into a mess. The Liverpool counter is thwarted by Haaland. He fired up... and has a chance from a low Doku cross at the near post that is scrambled behind for a corner.

20th minute: Doku with some fancy footwork, City's attack breaks down but Rodri wins it straight back. The crowd roar but Guardiola urdges calm. He doesn't want a basketball game. Nevertheless, Haaland almost catches out Alisson near his goalline, then Liverpool break and an offside flag halts them. This is warming up, which is more than can be said for my fingers in the press box.

17th minute: Nunez again! This time Walker and Dias get back to avert the danger. Good moments for the visitors.

16th minute: Chance for Nunez! Liverpool's first foray of any substance and it yields the best chance of the match. Salah with a chipped in-swinging cross and the Uruguay international's glancing header is well-saved by Ederson. Walker prevents Diogo Jota from getting to the second ball.

14th minute: Haaland barrels Szoboszlai out of the way, Doku's teases a dangerous cross to the far post where Tsimikas clears.

13th minute: Alvarez punts a through ball for Haaland. It's just behind the striker and he can't sort his long leavers out.

11th minute: I was just about to stay how defensively assured Liverpool looked. Then Alisson made an absolute fiasco of a clearance. Foden's excellent touch gave him a shooting opportunity - one he should have made far more of.

5th minute: Intense and scrappy so far. Nunez gives the ball away on halfway but bustles back to retrieve the situation.

1st minute: And we're off. Limited feeling out! Salah marauds through the centre of the field and Walker snuffs out the attack. Now here come City. Doku gets his first look at Alexander-Arnold. His low cross is cleared.

Man City vs. Liverpool: Pre-match commentary, analysis, stats, and more

5 mins to kickoff: City have just unveiled huge banners of the Premier League trophy, FA Cup and Champions League trophy on the field. If you've got it, flaunt it, I guess. Here come the teams.

20 mins to kickoff: It's going to be interesting to see how Jones gets on today. The midfield three of himself, Mac Allister and Szoboszlai looked to have the making of something really promising before Jones was sent off in that bonkers game at Tottenham. Then injury struck but Klopp putting the three of them back together for a game of this magnitude suggests he definitely liked what he saw earlier in the campaign.

40 mins to kickoff: Doku's magnificent start to life at Manchester City means the main reaction to any teamsheet with the Belgium international on it is excitement. Alexander-Arnold's forays into midfield might have to take a back seat to a torrid lunchtime of right-back duties. But Grealish feels like huge miss for City today. He was their best player in this fixture last season, rounding off the scoring in a 4-1 win, which Guardiola's side lacked their customary control as the England star spend the first hour on the bench at Stamford Bridge last time out.

Had Mateo Kovacic and Matheus Nunes not also been out, perhaps Guardiola would have made more substantial alterations. But it's a very similar side to the Chelsea game. Are we to expect a very similar spectacle? Buckle up.

58 mins to kickoff: And this is what the Liverpool team will look like. Nunez starts alongside Salah and Diogo Jota in attack. Curtis Jones joins Mac Allister and Szoboszlai in Klopp's midfield three, the England Under-21 international's first Premier League appearance since being sent off at Tottenham and then suffering a thigh injury.

How we line up to take on Manchester City ðŸ“‹ðŸ”´#MCILIV â€” Liverpool FC (@LFC) November 25, 2023

1 hour to kickoff: Here's the City team. No Grealish due to illness, Stones on the bench. Haaland, Alvarez and Doku all start, with Nathan Ake replacing Josko Gvardiol in the only change to the defence that shipped four goals at Chelsea.

1hr 5 mins to kickoff: Lots of excitable murmurs going around, mostly concerning the Manchester City lineup. John Stones, presumed out, was on the team bus that arrived at the stadium a short while ago but Jack Grealish wasn't. Jeremy Doku will start, Julian Alvarez wasn't and then he was. We'll find out soon enough...

1 hr 20 mins to kickoff: The confirmed team news will be with us in around 20 minutes and this is a game that has been known to bring out Guardiola's funky side from time to time. All eyes will be on the centre-forward positions. Does Klopp unleash Darwin Nunez after three goals in two matches for Uruguay during the international break? For City, Erling Haaland dropped a non-too-subtle social media hint yesterday evening that he's going to be fit for this one after suffering knock on Norway duty.

1 hr 40 mins to kickoff: A little over a decade ago, following their titanic tussles at Barcelona and Real Madrid, world football was all about Pep Guardiola vs. Jose Mourinho. Now, in terms of elite coaching rivalries, this is the only show in town. At his pre-match news conference, Guardiola was asked whether Jurgen Klopp was the toughest rival of his career.

Yes, by far. Because we have faced each other a thousand million times. Absolutely, he made me better, he helped me reflect on a lot of things with the problems they have created for us, itâ€™s part of when you are many years in this business, him and his teams, here and Dortmund have always been big rivals, good games for both, both teams have a positive approach to the games and always attractive. Iâ€™m pretty sure he made me a better manager through his teams, and of course, the way we play for them is good with the transitions, they have a lot of space in behind, they are fantastic with the runs, they are a fantastic team, fantastic legs, a top side, no doubt.

2 hours to kickoff: Hello and welcome to The Sporting News' live coverage of Manchester City vs. Liverpool from the Etihad Stadium. One point separated these two teams at the top of the table in 2018/19 and 2021/22. One point separates them right now. Are we heading to that place again? The forthcoming 90 minutes should give us a pretty good indication.

Man City vs. Liverpool lineups, team news

Midfielders Mateo Kovacic and Matheus Nunes are out for City after being forced to withdraw from international duty with Croatia and Portugal. Nathan Ake replaces Kovacic's compatriot Josko Gvardiol at left-back following the 4-4 draw at Chelsea last time out.

Jack Grealish was a late withdrawal due to illness but Erling Haaland is fit to start. John Stones returns on the bench following a hamstring injury.

Man City lineup (4-2-3-1, right to left): Ederson (GK) â€” Walker, Akanji, Dias, Ake â€” Rodri, Silva â€” Foden, Alvarez, Doku â€” Haaland.

Klopp has not flagged up any new injuries following the international break and Ryan Gravenberch and Ibrahima Konate both return on the bench after missing out in their 3-0 win over Brentford last time out. Joel Matip got the nod over the latter to start at centre-back.

Alexis Mac Allister is also back from suspension and joins Curtis Jones in midfield. This is the England Under-21 international's first

Liverpool lineup (4-3-3, right to left): Alisson (GK) â€” Alexander-Arnold, Matip, van Dijk, Tsimikas â€” Szoboszlai, Mac Allister, Jones â€” Salah, Nunez, Diogo Jota.
