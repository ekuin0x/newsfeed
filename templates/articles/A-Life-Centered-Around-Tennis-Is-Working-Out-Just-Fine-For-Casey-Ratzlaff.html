                <textarea id="text" readonly> Casey Ratzlaff, the top-ranked American man in wheelchair tennis, lives a simple life — according to his own rationalization. On an average day, he practices tennis, spends time helping coach Dartmouth men’s tennis players, works out off-court and crashes at home for some downtime.

It’s a good life, one he enjoys a lot.

Tennis is his priority, occupying his time as a professional player and a volunteer assistant coach for Dartmouth. Ratzlaff, ranked No. 14 in the world, remains constant with his main goals: trying to win Grand Slams, qualifying for another Paralympic Games and performing well in other big tournaments. Most pressing in the near term are the Parapan American Games being held Nov. 17-26 in Santiago, Chile.

“My focus is tennis, and being here (at Dartmouth) is really perfect for me,” said Ratzlaff, who moved to Hanover, New Hampshire, over the summer to start his new gig with the men’s team. He followed his personal coach, Justin DeSanto, from the University of Alabama at Birmingham to Dartmouth. DeSanto was the head coach at UAB and is in the same capacity in Hanover.

“Justin, and everybody here, is so supportive of my career and my focus on being the best in the world,” Ratzlaff, 25, said. “The facilities here are first-class and make it super easy for me to practice and train, do the off-court workouts, all in the same place. It encompasses all of my needs; it has been a great experience so far.”

Ratzlaff is a college student himself, taking undergraduate online classes in sports management at Wichita State University in his hometown. He jokes he is on the “1,000-year plan,” with his life playing in Grand Slams and big tournaments taking precedence.

He enjoys being part of the college tennis scene, helping Dartmouth’s players on and off the court. He freely admits being an elite wheelchair player has differences from the able-bodied game they’re playing, but in the end, the court and strategies remain the same for all. </textarea>
