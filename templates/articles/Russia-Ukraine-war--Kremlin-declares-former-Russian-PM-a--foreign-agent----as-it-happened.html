                <textarea id="text" readonly> From 14h ago 08.41 GMT Kremlin declares former Russian PM a 'foreign agent' The Russian ex-prime minister and now Kremlin critic Mikhail Kasyanov has been added to a registry of foreign agents, Russia’s justice ministry has announced. Reuters reports that the “foreign agent” designation requires people and entities on the list to place a disclaimer on items they publish and imposes strict financial reporting and self-disclosure requirements. Mikhail Kasyanov. Photograph: Shamil Zhumatov/Reuters Kasyanov first made his name as a foreign debt expert, rising swiftly through the finance ministry in the 1990s. As finance minister, he led negotiations to restructure massive Soviet-era commercial debts, securing a large discount and a reputation as a suave but tough negotiator. He served as prime minister for the first four years of Putin’s administration and was sacked in February 2004, weeks before Putin was elected for a second term. After his sacking, he went into opposition to the Kremlin. In 2022, he left the country and has criticised Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

8h ago 15.02 GMT Closing summary Ukraine faced its biggest drone attack of the war so far last night, according to Kyiv. Five people were wounded by falling debris in the capital city, including an 11-year-old child, and the attack led to power cuts.

Ukraine’s air force said it shot down 7 1 of the 75 drones launched in the attack. “The enemy launched a record number of attack drones at Ukraine! The main direction of the attack is Kyiv,” the commander of Ukraine’s air force, Gen Mykola Oleshchuk, said.

The former Russian prime minister turned Kremlin critic Mikhail Kasyanov has been added to a list of “foreign agents”, Russia’s justice ministry has announced. Kasyanov, who was the first head of Putin’s government in the early 2000s, now appears in the justice ministry’s register of foreign agents, a term reminiscent of the Soviet-era “enemy of the people”.

The UK Ministry of Defence reported that Russia’s Black Sea fleet is facing issues reloading its vessels with cruise missiles. Russia will, the MoD said, need to overcome such issues “in time for maritime cruise missiles to be included in any winter campaign of strikes against Ukraine”.

The Swiss president, Alain Berset, was in Kyiv to meet his Ukrainian counterpart and attend an international summit on food security. Latvia’s president, Edgars Rinkēvičs, was also in Ukraine – he met the country’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, and they discussed the progress of Ukraine’s integration into the EU.

9h ago 13.34 GMT The UK defence secretary, Grant Shapps, has reiterated his support for Ukraine following the drone attack. He tweeted:



10h ago 13.15 GMT Ukraine’s energy ministry said 17,000 people were without power in the Kyiv region as a result of the attack, noting that four power lines were damaged. Power was restored later during the day.

10h ago 12.40 GMT Ukraine’s air force said it downed 74 of the 75 Russian attack drones that hit the country overnight, AFP reports. The majority were downed over Kyiv, causing power cuts in the centre of the city as temperatures dipped below freezing. The drone attack – the largest since Russia’s full-scale invasion according to Kyiv – came as Ukraine marked Holodomor Remembrance Day, commemorating the 1930s starvation of millions in Ukraine under Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. “The enemy launched a record number of attack drones at Ukraine! The main direction of the attack is Kyiv,” the commander of Ukraine’s air force, Gen Mykola Oleshchuk, said. Kyiv authorities said five people – including an 11-year-old child – were wounded in the capital, where the air raid lasted six hours. Local resident Viktor Vasylenko said he had soothed his young daughter, who experienced “panic and nausea” during the long night-time attacks as they sheltered in a corridor. The 38-year-old said his family always has “everything prepared” in case of such attacks but it was the first time one had hit so close. “My wife thought that the house would collapse in half,” he said.

12h ago 10.54 GMT The UK’s Ministry of Defence reports that Russia’s Black Sea fleet is facing issues reloading its vessels with cruise missiles. It said: Traditionally, BSF has reloaded cruise missiles at Sevastopol in Crimea. With that facility increasingly held at risk by Ukrainian long range strikes, Russia will highly likely see Novorossiysk as the best alternative site. However, relocating and reloading the missiles would require new delivery, storage, handling and loading processes. On 13 November 2023, the Ukrainian military claimed that Russia has paused firing maritime cruise missiles because of ‘logistical problems’ at Novorossiysk. Russia will, the MoD said, need to overcome such issues “in time for maritime cruise missiles to be included in any winter campaign of strikes against Ukraine”.

12h ago 10.24 GMT The Swiss president, Alain Berset, arrived in Kyiv on Saturday to meet his Ukrainian counterpart and attend an international summit on food security, he said in a post on X. Ukraine is hosting an international summit to promote its efforts to export grain despite an ongoing Russian blockade of the Black Sea, its main export route. Arrival in Kyiv where I will be attending the international summit on food security today and meeting President @ZelenskyyUa. The focus is on the impact of Russia’s war of aggression on 🌎 food security and Switzerland's long-term support for 🇺🇦. — Alain Berset (@alain_berset) November 25, 2023

14h ago 08.24 GMT President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday that Ukraine needed to secure three key “victories” abroad: the approval of major aid packages from the US Congress and the European Union, and a formal start of accession talks to join the EU, Reuters reports. Zelenskiy also announced the latest dismissals in the military – four deputy commanders in the national guard – but gave no reasons for their removal. The president and other officials have vowed to make the military’s operations more efficient and responsive to the needs of service personnel. Twenty months into Russia’s full-scale invasion, fatigue has crept into the west’s relations with Kyiv, which heavily relies on its allies for military, economic and humanitarian aid. “We need three victories. The first one is the victory with US Congress. It’s a challenge, it’s not easy, but Ukraine is doing everything,” Zelenskiy told a news conference in Kyiv. The US president, Joe Biden, asked Congress last month to approve many billions of dollars in assistance for Ukraine, but Kyiv’s funding was omitted from a stopgap spending bill passed last week, raising concerns it may not get through.

15h ago 08.11 GMT Ukraine says overnight drone attack was largest of the war Ukraine’s capital city took the brunt of what the country’s air force described as Russia’s largest drone attack of the war on Saturday. Reuters reports five people were wounded as the continuing rumble of air defences and explosions woke residents. The attack, which used Iranian-designed Shahed kamikaze drones, began hitting different districts of Kyiv in the early hours of Saturday, with more waves coming as the sun rose. Explosions are seen in the sky over Kyiv. Photograph: Gleb Garanich/Reuters A spokesperson for Kyiv’s city administration told public broadcaster Suspilne at least 40 drones had been downed. Mayor Vitali Klitschko, writing on the Telegram app, said the attack had injured five people, including an 11-year-old girl, and damaged buildings in districts all across the city. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that most of the drones were shot down. A searchlight over Kyiv. Photograph: Gleb Garanich/Reuters
