Besides praying for global peace and bonhomie, celebrities are soaking in the festive vibe of Gurpurab.For celebs, this year’s Gurpurab is all about nagar kirtan and attending langars after a hiatus of two years. For some, it’s an occasion to don their traditional wear, relish kada prashad and offer prayers at a gurdwara.I am married into a Sikh family, so Gurpurab is a huge celebration.It’s now bigger than the way I used to celebrate it before my marriage. I am very excited as our whole house is decked up and illuminated. For us, it’s a tradition to visit a gurdwara and do prayers and paath. I will be back in Mumbai as my shooting schedule in Bhopal is wrapping up. I will take my kids to a nearby gurdwara for matha tekna.By next Gurpurab, I look to fulfil my long-pending dream of taking Gurpurab celebrations to the Times Square in New York City. This Gurpurab, I will start to work on doing Japji Sahib musically. Also, I am going to run an extensive campaign on it on social media this time.Gurpurab is the time for celebrations and prayers. While my visit to a gurdwara is already planned, this time I will do some sewa in the langar and help other members of the community there. I wish there’s peace in this world and happiness prevails.The last two years have been tough amid the pandemic. I am happy that things are getting normal. Gurpurab is a very big festival for us Punjabis. Though I am shooting today, I will try my best to visit the gurdwara and take part in the festivities.I follow teachings of Baba ji and grew up singing shabad gurbani. It's the most celebrated time in our home. My first introduction to music/singing stint was a shabad recital at a Gurudwara. That's my core memory and I remember taking part in a Nagar Kirtan and roaming around the city roads along with the sangat. The feeling is just superb. I also cannot forget relishing kada prashad while walking. This year I have created a track, Simran, to thank Baba ji for giving me such a beautiful life, the one full of achievements and happiness. I am a spiritual person. Though I will be performing in Jalandhar, Punjab, a day prior to the festival, I will be back on 8th (the day of the festival). I will be attending Gurpurab festivities at Gurudwara Saheb Four Bungalows in Mumbai. I will sit there, attend kirtan, do ardas and later relish langar.Gurpurab is a guru ka festival. I will celebrate with lot of dhoom dhaam. I thank God that pandemic s not as bad as it was till last year. I will take part in the bhog of Akhand Path and stay for kirtan and do ardas. I hope to start the day by taking part in the kirtan procession. Of course, I can't wait to relish the delicious langar. I have always been very excited about Gurpurab festivities. </textarea>
