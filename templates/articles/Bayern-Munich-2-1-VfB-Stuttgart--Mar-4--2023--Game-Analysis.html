                <textarea id="text" readonly> Bayern Munich snatched a 2-1 victory at VfB Stuttgart on Saturday courtesy of a fine Matthijs de Ligt performance that put them back into top spot in the Bundesliga.

The Dutch defender drilled in their opening goal in the 39th minute after also denying Stuttgart the lead two minutes earlier when he cleared the ball off the goalline.

Bayern, who face Paris St Germain in the Champions League Round of 16 second leg on Wednesday following their 1-0 in the first leg, are on 49 points, ahead on goal difference of Borussia Dortmund, winners 2-1 over RB Leipzig on Friday.

Union Berlin are in third place on 44 following their goalless draw against Cologne.

"We did not do it well on several counter attacks when we were 2-0 up," Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann said. "And then when you concede late then the opponent just throws everything in it."

"In the end it was a deserved win because we were the better team, but we all still have to finish games more seriously."

Stuttgart powered to a strong start and caused some early panic in the Bayern defence with their high pressing game while also keeping goalkeeper Yann Sommer busy before the visitors gradually pushed back.

Despite controlling possession in the first half, Bayern struggled to break through and even the occasional Jamal Musiala solo failed to crack open the Stuttgart backline.

It was de Ligt who had the answer when he wrongfooted his marker and unleashed a shot through a crowded box with Stuttgart keeper Fabian Bredlow letting the ball slip through his hands.

Just two minutes earlier it was de Ligt who had come to the rescue at the other end, clearing a point-blank Konstantinos Mavropanos effort off the line.

With Stuttgart having run out of steam, Bayern struck again with Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting - fresh from extending his contract on Friday - finishing off a dazzling three-pass move that left their opponents' defence frozen in place.

It was the Cameroon striker's 10th league goal of the season.

Stuttgart grabbed a deserved goal with Juan Jose Perea in the 88th that injected some late drama in the game but the hosts ran out of time before they could find an equaliser. </textarea>
