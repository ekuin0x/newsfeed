Black Friday Deal: 34" Alienware AW3423DWF QD OLED Gaming Monitor

Bonus $100 Dell eGift Card Alienware AW3423DWF 34" 3440x1400 Curved 0.1ms 165Hz QD-OLED Gaming Monitor 20% off $999.99 29 $799.99 See on Dell

The Alienware AW3423DWF is one of only two QD OLED gaming monitors that Dell sells. This 34" monitor sports a 3440x1440 WQHD resolution with a 1ms response time and 165Hz refresh rate. It uses a Samsung quantum dot OLED panel. This is the same panel found in the Samsung Odyssey G8 34" QD OLED gaming monitor which is currently on sale for $70 more (and no gift card). Quantum dot, or "QD", OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy and range and wide viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. The AW3423DWF boasts a 99.3% DCI-P3 color range and is factory calibrated with a Delta E less than 2. It is HDR True Black 400 certified and boasts up to 1,000nits of peak brightness.

If you're not looking for a true 4K monitor, this is one of the best monitors out there. The ultrawide WQHD resolution of this monitor measures out to a respectable 109ppi. You can get something like an RTX 4060 Ti or RTX 4070 GPU and achieve perfectly playable framerates. A true 4K monitor requires a much more powerful video card. We'd recommend at the very least a 4070 Ti and more likely a 4080, which will add significantly to the cost of your gaming build.

We've reviewed the Alienware AW3423DWF monitor and absolutely loved it, even at its original $1099 MSRP. It's easily one of the best gaming monitors on the market, especially at this price point.

Alienware AW3423DWF IGN review (9/10) "Though $1,099 is far from cheap, the Alienware AW3423DWF feels like a great value compared to the original. It offers the same stunning picture, and dropping G-Sync Ultimate really makes no noticeable difference in actual gameplay. What’s left is a monitor that is extremely similar for $200 less than it was earlier this year. That’s a win and an easy recommendation to make if you’re in the market for a high-end display with a spectacular picture."
