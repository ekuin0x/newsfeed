                <textarea id="text" readonly> John Mulaney is reminded of his own battle with addiction when thinking of the late “Friends” actor Matthew Perry.

In an interview with Variety published Monday, the Emmy-award-winning comedian said he “really identified” with Perry's battle.

“Addiction is just a disaster,” said Mulaney, who has been open about fighting addictions to Adderall and Xanax.

“Life is like a wobbly table at a restaurant and you pile all this (expletive) on it, and it gets wobblier and wobblier and more unstable,” he continued. “Then drugs just kick the … legs out from under the table. I really identified with his story. I’m thinking about him a lot.”

Perry was found dead in a jacuzzi in his Los Angeles home on Oct. 28. He was 54.

In 2022, Perry opened up about life behind the scenes of “Friends,” chronicling his battle with alcohol and drugs in his memoir, "Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing." Perry wrote with candor and compassion and showed his dedication to continue fighting a near-fatal battle.

Since his death, a foundation established in Perry's name will help those struggling with addiction. The Matthew Perry Foundation, announced less than a week after the actor's death, will continue Perry's "enduring commitment to helping others struggling with the disease of addiction."

A coroner's report and toxicology exam for Perry is expected in the coming weeks.

In Mulaney’s latest Netflix special, “Baby J,” the comedian delivers a revelatory routine, once again transforming his struggles into a set that draws laughter and undoubtedly allows other addicts to relate.

Mulaney, 41, got sober first at 23 after battling a dependency on cocaine and alcohol, and again in 2021. After a 2020 drug relapse and a “star-studded intervention” organized by a dozen comics — including Seth Meyers, Nick Kroll and Fred Armisen — he completed rehab for addictions to cocaine, Adderall, Xanax, Klonopin and Percocet.

After completing treatment in early 2021, Mulaney filed for divorce from artist Anna Marie Tendler after nearly seven years of marriage. He and actress Olivia Munn welcomed a son, Malcolm, in November 2021.
