                <textarea id="text" readonly> Italy advanced to the Davis Cup Final 8 on Sunday when singles wins from Matteo Arnaldi and Lorenzo Sonego gave their country an unassailable 2-0 lead against already-eliminated Sweden.

Italy needed just one win from its three ties against Sweden in Bologna to qualify from Group A and Arnaldi quickly delivered.

The 22-year-old, who reached the fourth round at the US Open, defeated Swedenâ€™s Leo Borg 6-4, 6-3 in one hour and 22 minutes to secure his country a place in the Davis Cup knockout rounds in Malaga this November.

Sonego then overcame Elias Ymer 6-4, 6-4 to move Italy 2-0 ahead. The result means the former champion will join Group A winners Canada in the next round. Italy has now advanced to the Davis Cup quarter-finals five times since 2016. Last year it reached the semi-finals, losing to eventual champion Canada.

Spain Defeats South Korea

Already-eliminated Spain ended its Group C campaign on a high with victory against South Korea.

The former champion lost its first two ties against group winners Czech Republic and second-placed Serbia and was therefore unable to qualify for the Final 8 despite the result against South Korea on Sunday in Valencia.

They finished third in Group C, though, with Bernabe Zapata Miralles beating Hong Seongchan 6-4, 7-5, before Alejandro Davidovich Fokina downed Soonwoo Kwon 6-4, 6-4.

South Korea finished fourth in Group C. </textarea>
