                <textarea id="text" readonly> Borussia Dortmund are set to play six pre-season friendlies this summer, including blockbuster matches against Manchester United and Chelsea in the United States.

The 2023/24 season will get underway in less than two months, and Borussia Dortmund have now revealed their full pre-season schedule. The Black and Yellows will make their return to training on July 5, and begin preparations for the start of the new season.

Borussia Dortmund’s first game of pre-season will see them go up against Oberliga side Westfalia Rhynern on July 12. They will then be in action again a week later against Regionalliga side Rot-Weiß Oberhausen. BVB’s third game of pre-season will be against another Regionalliga side Rot-Weiß Erfurt on July 22.

Edin Terzic’s side will then travel to the United States for a pre-season training camp, where they will play three friendly matches. Borussia Dortmund will go up against USL Championship side San Diego Loyal on July 28, before traveling to Las Vegas to face Manchester United on July 31, and then heading to Chicago to take on Chelsea on August 3.

Borussia Dortmund will then return to Germany and take on Ajax at the Signal Iduna Park on August 6.

The Borussia Dortmund players currently on international duty are likely to miss the early stages of pre-season. While Youssoufa Moukoko is expected to miss a fair bit of BVB’s pre-season preparation after being named in the Germany U-21s squad for the UEFA European Under-21 Championship.

The 2023/24 season will get underway with the first round of the DFB-Pokal (August 11-14). Borussia Dortmund will then begin their Bundesliga campaign on the following weekend, with the fixtures set to be released later this month. </textarea>
