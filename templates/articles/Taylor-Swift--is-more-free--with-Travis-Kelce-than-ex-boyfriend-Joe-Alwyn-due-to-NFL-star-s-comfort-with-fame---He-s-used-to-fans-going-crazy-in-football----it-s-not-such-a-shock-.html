                <textarea id="text" readonly> Travis Kelce's familiarity with being in the spotlight has been a key factor in his relationship with Taylor Swift going so well, it has been reported.

The Kansas City Chiefs star has seen his profile spiral in the last few months since Swift confirmed rumors of the pair dating by turning up at his September 24 game against Chicago Bears.

But Kelce is no stranger to fame, given he is one of the best tight ends in NFL history and a two-time Super Bowl winner. And according to OK Magazine, Swift is grateful of his patience with the attention that inevitably falls on them.

The publication quoted a source as saying: 'He’s used to fans going crazy in football, so it’s not such a shock.

'Taylor knows it’s a lot for anyone to handle, but Travis learned to manage it over the years with NFL fans and not let it affect him.

Travis Kelce's comfort with fame has reportedly been a key factor in his Taylor Swift romance

Swift's ex-boyfriend of six years, Joe Alwyn, shunned the limelight when he was with her

'With Taylor’s ex Joe (Alwyn), she was so private. They’d never go outside and walk around together. They just stayed at her Nashville compound or her Rhode Island house.

'With Travis, she’s more free and able to share her full life and she loves it.'

Swift, 33, split with Alwyn earlier this year after six years together.

In the earlier days of their romance, Kelce was asked about the extra attention that was going to fall on him after he and Swift went public.

'As all the attention comes, it feels like, you know - I was on top of the world after the Super Bowl and right now even more on top of the world now,' he said at the start of October.

'You have got a lot of people that care about Taylor, for good reason. Got to keep living and learning and enjoying the moments. We're learning with the paparazzi taking photos all over the place but it comes with it.'

At the start of the week, Kelce gave an interview with Wall Street Journal where he opened up further on being significantly more famous due to his relationship with Swift.

Kelce said: 'Obviously I've never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them…. I've never dealt with it,' Kelce explained. 'But at the same time, I'm not running away from any of it.

Kelce gave an interview to Wall Street Journal this week about his romance with Swift

As a two-time Super Bowl winner in the NFL, Kelce is used to attention falling his way

'The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she's just living, enjoying life. When she acts like that I better not be the one acting all strange.'

For now though, Kelce's attention is on football with the Chiefs playing Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday afternoon in the NFL.

Kelce and his team were beaten on Monday night by the Philadelphia Eagles - the team Swift grew up supporting. </textarea>
