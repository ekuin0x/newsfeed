                <textarea id="text" readonly> Borussia Dortmund are set to make an offer for Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho this winter, as the Premier league club look for a solution to his situation.

The never-ending saga surrounding Jadon Sancho’s next move after having falling out with Erik ten Hag at Manchester United is set to continue as rumors linking him to a return to Borussia Dortmund have begun to intensify. According to ESPN, Die Schwarzgelben is preparing to make a move for their former player this winter, with the proposed deal set to be a short term loan.

The report also indicates that United are aware that Sancho’s situation can’t go on indefinitely, as it looks the player has made up his mind to not apologize to the manager for their public dispute. It is because of this that United are ready to “take a financial hit” on the player and move on, cutting their losses.

For any potential deal to make sense for Dortmund, the short term loan in question would also have to include a relatively reasonable option to make the player their own again once the loan is over. This is likely to be something discussed particularly because a mere loan isn’t advantageous for either side. If Sancho’s United career is indeed “over”, then permanent separation will have to be their main consideration. Dortmund, on the other hand, have no need for a player who would possibly return to form and then go back to United, especially out on the wings considering they have youthful wingers like Jamie Bynoe-Gittens and Julien Duranville to develop.

What we can be certain of at this time that this is a risk-reward based situation for Dortmund. The club have no guarantee that Sancho will just continue where he left off with the club, but should they choose to invest in him and build him and his confidence back up, they could possibly reintroduce a creative spark into this side that has been lacking since the season began. </textarea>
