                <textarea id="text" readonly> 10.5 to MP O'Dowd , Oh that's the plumbest of lbws, you don't have to refer that! He zips it in quicker and it holds its line as he plays down the wrong line while trying to tuck that away off his pads, it tenderises his pads as the umpire raises the dreaded finger. He has to go back to the hut, bye. Well, actually on the replay, it's not really stone dead, may have just clipped the leg stump so he might have given it a shot and sent it upstairs but the moment has passed now so no points crying over spilt milk . 43 / 2

32.5 to CN Ackermann , shapes to switch hit, and finds short third! It was a length ball angled into the right-hander, and it pitched outside leg. Ackermann switched over early, and ended up lobbing it to the fielder inside the circle. The ball was dipping on to Henry, but he took that well . 157 / 5

34.5 to SA Edwards , Santner takes it off his own bowling, as he ended where a few steps behind the stumps at his end. He tossed it up, and went really slow. The ball was full and outside off, as Edwards went slogging across the line. But he got a top edge - perhaps beaten by the slowness of the ball, and of the pitch - to all but end Netherlands' hopes . 174 / 6

36.3 to RE van der Merwe , Foxed! Santner prompts a false shot. Attempts another reverse sweep and Henry doesn't errs on this occasion, redeems himself by swallowing it up at point and he has a big, broad smile on his face like a student who gets straight A's at the end of a semester . 180 / 7 </textarea>
