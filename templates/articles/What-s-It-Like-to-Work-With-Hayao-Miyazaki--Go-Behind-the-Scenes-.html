                <textarea id="text" readonly> Over the years, Suzuki has become increasingly indispensable for Miyazaki. “He always tells me, ‘Suzuki-san, can you remember the important things for me?’ And then he feels that he can forget about all the important things not concerning his films. I have to remember them for him,” Suzuki said.

Best friends more than mere collaborators, Miyazaki and Suzuki talk every day, even if there’s nothing urgent to discuss, and make it a rule to meet in person on Mondays and Thursdays. “What we talk about is very trivial most times, I guess he feels lonely or misses me, but it’s always him who calls me. I never call him,” Suzuki said, adding with a laugh, “Sometimes he even calls me in the middle of the night, like at 3 a.m., and the first thing he says is, ‘Were you awake?’ And obviously I was not. I’m in bed!”

In contrast, Hisaishi, the composer who first worked with Miyazaki on the 1984 feature “Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind,” has a strictly professional relationship with him.

“We don’t see each other in private,” Hisaishi, wearing an elegant sweater, said through a translator. “We don’t eat together. We don’t drink together. We only meet to discuss things for work.” That emotional distance, he added, is what has made their partnership over 11 films so creatively fruitful.

“People think that if you really know a person’s full character then you can have a good working relationship, but that doesn’t necessarily hold true,” Hisaishi said. “What is most important to me is to compose music. The most important thing in life to Mr. Miyazaki is to draw pictures. We are both focused on those most important things in our lives.” </textarea>
