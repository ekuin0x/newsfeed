                <textarea id="text" readonly> Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause lesions, rashes, and fevers.

Michigan health officials reported a cluster of syphilis infections in the eye.

Ocular syphilis is typically rare and occurs in only 1% of patients.

Multiple women developed syphilis in their eyes after sexual interactions with one infected man, leading to speculation about a new strain of the bacteria, health officials reported.

From March to July of 2022, health officials in Michigan investigated a cluster of ocular syphilis cases connected to a single man, according to a report published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's "Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report."

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that occurs in several stages, each with its own symptoms, according to the CDC.

Throughout the four stages, signs of the infection could include sores on and around the genitals, rashes, fever, weight loss, and, eventually, issues with mental function and muscle movements, per the CDC.

Ocular syphilis usually includes pain in the eyes, and changes in vision, including potential blindness, per the CDC.

While ocular syphilis isn't new, it is rare. It only occurs in about one percent of syphilis infections, per ArsTechnica, and usually in only in cases that are late stage, in people older than 65, in HIV-positive people, or those who inject drugs.

All five of the women in this cluster, though, were between 40 and 60 years old, had early-stage infections, and said they did not inject any drugs, per ArsTechnica.

The man who was initially infected showed no signs of vision issues and had early-stage latent syphilis without symptoms, according to the report.

Because of the cluster, researchers think the women and their partner may have contracted a particular strain of syphilis that is more likely to cause infection in the eyes and brain, per the report.

Health officials in Michigan couldn't identify the strain, since the patients lacked lesions that could be used for genetic testing, per ArsTechnica.

According to recent data from the CDC, there has been an almost 75% increase in syphilis cases since 2017 in the United States.

The best way to prevent the spread of an STD, per the CDC, is to communicate with sexual partners, get tested for potential diseases, and seek treatment if infected.
