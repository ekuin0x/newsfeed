                <textarea id="text" readonly> Manchester United head to Goodison on Sunday afternoon to face Sean Dyche’s Everton, here’s our predicted XI.

Erik ten Hag’s side has seen major improvements in recent games and currently ranks as the league’s most in form side.

Four wins in five for Manchester United sees them sit currently in eighth but will have renewed confidence upon the return of some key players.

Luke Shaw has returned after months away injured, but that has arrived with bad news as Mason Mount is said to be injured.

United can expect a rowdy Goodison this Sunday after their 10-point deduction which leaves them joint bottom of the league.

Manchester United predicted XI v Everton

Given how up-for-it the crowd at Goodison will be, expect Ten Hag to go for a very strong side here.

Therefore, in goal, Andre Onana should be in line to start despite injury concerns picked up over the international break. It was confirmed he was okay which should be good enough to see him play ahead of Altay Bayindir.

At right-back, it’ll be a toss-up between Diogo Dalot and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, but we think the former Palace man edges it here. His defensive acumen could come in handy, given how Everton are likely to come out of the blocks fast.

At left-back, Luke Shaw starts as Ten Hag sounded fairly confident in his availability. If he is fit enough to start, he needs to be playing from minute one.

In central defence the duo of Harry Maguire and Raphael Varane should start, as Ten Hag said they can play together in certain games, this is one of them, through the fact Jonny Evans and Lisandro Martinez are injured.

United’s options in midfield have been seriously depleted in recent weeks. Christian Eriksen, Casemiro and Mason Mount are all currently out.

Therefore, a midfield duo of Scott McTominay and a first league start for Kobbie Mainoo is our choice to face an Amadou Onana-less Everton.

On the right, Ten Hag most likely puts Antony on the right, the Brazilian scored twice against Everton last season.

The left side should then see Alejandro Garnacho start, he often does so well and just needs game time to fine-tune his end product and decision-making.

Bruno Fernandes starts in his usual number 10 position as you would expect. United’s captain will be hoping to continue the positive improvements.

Up-front Marcus Rashford should start, with Rasmus Hojlund not being rushed back into action so soon.

Man United predicted XI: Onana; Wan-Bissaka, Varane, Maguire, Shaw; McTominay, Mainoo; Antony, Bruno, Garnacho; Rashford. </textarea>
