                <textarea id="text" readonly> Comfy and stylish travel apparel is a cornerstone of any vacation packing list, and whether you’re in need of the perfect outfit to wear on a long-haul flight or a breathable piece to slide into once you’ve arrived at your destination, there’s one retailer that does it all: Everlane. Thankfully, Black Friday and Cyber Monday have brought about a new batch of deals that you’ll want to get your hands on before they sell out, complete with timeless, cozy essentials.

Right now, Everlane’s holiday sale is stocked with everything you need to add to your suitcase for your next trip. So, to make your shopping experience easier, we’ve rounded up the 12 must-have items to grab before they’re gone — and while you’re at it, knock out your holiday shopping for loved ones as well.

The Utility Barrel Pant

Everlane

Thanks to their forgiving cotton and elastane material, these utility pants from Everlane are as stylish as jeans, but with a little more give to keep you comfortable while traveling. Not only are they effortlessly cool while sightseeing or sitting on a long flight, but they’re also available in 12 stunning shades, including a (slightly more expensive, but still on sale) denim option. If you’re in love with the fit and want to snag a pair of jeans that you can actually sit in, this is the pair you’ve been looking for.

The Alpaca Crew

Everlane

I’m of the opinion that you can never have too many sweaters, and this ribbed crewneck that’s made with alpaca fur, nylon, and merino wool will prove to be an essential addition to your closet while it’s on sale for just $70. Shoppers have their choice of 13 shades from vibrant pink to taupe, and sizes even range from 2XS to 3XL so you can easily select your best fit. It’s also ultra-soft, so you’ll never have to worry about scratchy or uncomfortable sweaters on the go.

The ‘80s Blazer

Everlane

You’ll never regret having a timeless blazer in your closet for nice events and fancy dinners, and with the holiday season in full swing, now is the time to shop this 80s-style version while it’s a whopping 60 percent off at Everlane. The classic silhouette with a slightly oversized fit will create an effortless finish with every outfit you pair it with, and it can be easily dressed up or down depending on the occasion, making it a versatile travel staple. For just $71, you can’t go wrong with investing in this piece of multipurpose outerwear.

The Slouch Bootcut Jean

Everlane

'Tis the season for swapping out jeans that no longer fit for a slouchy bootcut pair like this one, that’s an impressive 60 percent off for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The relaxed fit is sure to look flattering on a wide range of body types, and the forgiving organic cotton-tencel blend moves with your every step for optimal comfort. Plus, you can choose from three timeless colors, with sizes ranging from 23 to 33.

The Cotton-Merino Vintage Henley

Everlane

If you’ve found yourself wishing you had an oversized top that’s not quite a sweatshirt to slip into while the temperatures plummet, this vintage-style henley is sure to make your wish list this holiday season — and it’s even on sale for 30 percent off to add some style back into your loungewear. This classically cool sweater is perfect to throw on for long-haul flights or even to build an outfit around while you’re gearing up for a day of sightseeing, and it’s uniquely designed with a stylish notched neckline and a ribbed hem and sleeves. Shop the soft and sturdy cotton-merino top in three neutral shades, and you can select your best fit with sizes ranging from 2XS to XL. We’re pretty sure you’re going to be racking up compliments in this one.

The Lug Loafer

Everlane

Loafers are having a moment this fall and winter, and if you want to get into the trend on a budget, you won’t want to miss out on these lug-soled loafers while they’re a whopping 40 percent off. This edgier take on a timeless style is made with premium leather and a chunky sole that boasts impressive grip against slippery terrain this winter, and sizes are available from 5 to 11 (half sizes included.) At $117 right now, these may just become your new favorite fall shoe.

The Quilted Cotton Liner

Everlane

Finding a stylish yet practical coat for late fall and early winter is no small task, but Everlane is making it easier than ever by discounting this effortless cotton liner 50 percent for the holidays. The coat is designed with an oversized fit and thoughtful details like a quilted finish and roomy side pockets, and it can be worn on its own or tucked under another coat for additional warmth during the winter. Three available shades mean you’ll have no difficulty slotting this piece into your wardrobe.

The Seamless Legging

Everlane

It’s always a good idea to have a comfy pair of leggings on hand, and at 60 percent off, Everlane’s seamless options are a steal. They’re perfect for travel days, lounging at home, or even heading to the gym, with an incredibly flattering and high-waisted fit alongside a stretchy waistband that won’t dig in or leave you uncomfortable. Plus, they’re made with a blend of organic cotton and recycled nylon, so you can rest easy knowing that you’ve successfully integrated sustainability into your wardrobe.

The Linen Way-High Drape Pant

Everlane

Linen pants will never go out of style, and this drapey, breathable pair is a testament to that fact — plus, they’re on sale for up to 50 percent off. We won’t blame you if you snatch up these pants in every one of the four gorgeous color options to outfit your travels throughout the year. The pleated, wide-leg design (available from size 00 to 16) looks timeless and cool on nearly every body type and is dressed up or down, making these pants a versatile addition to your suitcase.

The Satin Relaxed Shirt

Everlane

A relaxed-fit blouse is one of the most wearable items to have at your fingertips, and this elegant satin top is guaranteed to be a show-stopper all year — especially now that it’s on sale for half-off. There are six wearable colors and patterns to choose from, and you’ll have no trouble styling this shirt for any activity you might have planned during your next trip. And considering it’s made from a lightweight viscose material, you’ll never feel restricted or confined in this shirt.

The ReNew Transit Utility Backpack

Everlane

I’ve said time and time again that a backpack is the best thing you can bring on a plane as your personal item, and at just $43 right now, this stunning tote is a great addition to your packing lineup. The bag is made from a durable recycled polyester material and is large enough to fit a 13 inch laptop inside, even featuring two interior pockets as well as two external ones. Webbing at the back of the bag lets it attach easily to the handle of a rolling suitcase for simple navigation through the airport, and a padded back and bottom ensure this bag is comfortable to wear, even for long hours out and about.

The Structured Cotton Belted Pant

Everlane

Eye-catching pants can completely transform your wardrobe for the better, especially when they look as cool as these structured trousers with a built-in belt. A wide-leg fit is far more comfortable than rigid material hugging your skin, and right now this cotton pair of pants is on sale for 50 percent off, giving you the perfect excuse to swap out your less-loved pairs for something you’ll turn to all winter long. The high-waisted pants are also available in four gorgeous shades — don’t worry, we won’t tell if you snag them all.
