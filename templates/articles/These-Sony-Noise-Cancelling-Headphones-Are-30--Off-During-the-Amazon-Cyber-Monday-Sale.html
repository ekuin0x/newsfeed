                <textarea id="text" readonly> Sony's lineup of noise cancelling wireless headphones might have some pretty generic names, but the headphones themselves are anything but. For Cyber Monday, Amazon has dropped the price of the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones to only $228. That's $20 less than the best price we saw during Black Friday and a 34% discount off MSRP. This is easily one of the best noise cancelling headphones you can get. Many people even prefer them to the Bose QuietComfort models.

Cyber Monday Deal: 34% Off Sony WH1000XM4 Over-Ear Headphones

Sony WH-1000XM4 Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones 35% off $349.99 20 $228.00 See on Amazon

Sony's WH-1000XM series of headphones have shaken Bose's longstanding reputation for having the best noise cancelling headphones on the market. The WH-1000XM4 offers the coveted combination of outstanding sound quality and effective noise cancellation. They're also very comfortable to wear with ample amounts of padding in the earcups and the headband. The WH-1000XM4 also boasts up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. If you run out, charging for just 10 minutes will give you another 5 hours of playback. It charges via the newer universeal USB Type-C input, which is a welcome upgrade over the legacy Micro USB from previous models.

There is a newer model out, the WH-1000XM5. Right now it's on sale for $100 more, and it's definitely not worth the price premium. For people on the move, the XM4 might actually be the better headset because the XM5 is stiffer and doesn't stow away as compactly (the included case is also bigger). The sound quality on both is nearly identical, although the XM5 is reported to offer slightly better ANC in the treble and mid frequences and the microphone is improved.

Honestly, these rank as the top three best headphone deals for Cyber Monday, especially now with the recent price drop. The other two headphones you can also consider are the Bose QuietComfort 45 for $199 and the Beats Studio Pro for $170. I've tried all three and I do prefer the WH-1000XM4 over the rest, but all of these headphones perform well and are heavily discounted for a few more days.
