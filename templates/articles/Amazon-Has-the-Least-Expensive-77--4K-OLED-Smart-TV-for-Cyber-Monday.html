                <textarea id="text" readonly> Are you looking for a large 77" OLED TV made for current-gen console gaming, and you're on a budget? Those two conditions might sound mutually exclusive (and they usually are), but this Cyber Monday deal is as close as you can get. For Cyber Monday, Amazon has dropped the price on the 77" LG B3 4K OLED Smart TV to $1796.99. This is the least expensive 77" OLED TV for Cyber Monday and the only 77" OLED TV we've seen that's priced well under $2K. It's an especially good deal considering the fact that the B3 is a new 2023 model and even supports 4K @ 120Hz gaming over HDMI 2.1.

Cyber Monday Deal: 77" LG B3 4K OLED Smart TV for $1797

77" LG B3 4K OLED Smart TV 22% off $2,299.99 3 $1,796.99 See on Amazon

The LG B3 offers a better value than the C3 for both games and movies alike. The B3 excels at displaying 4K HDR movies and TV shoes at the best image quality possible. That's because the B3 is a true OLED TV with over 8 million self-lit pixels that turn on and off individually for perfect black and incredible colors. It also supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HLG as well as Dolby Atmos for positional sound imaging.

OLED technology aside, the LG B3 has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has a true 120Hz panel and two HDMI 2.1 ports for running 4K at 120Hz on a PS5, Xbox Series X, or RTX 40 series equipped PC. It features a blazing fast 0.1ms response time and supports variable refresh rate (VRR) including G-SYNC and auto low latency mode (ALLM).

Right now the 65" LG C3 model costs $1596.99 on Amazon. That extra $300 will give you a newer processor, a few more HDMI 2.1 ports, and a brighter display. Is it a better TV? Sure it is, but is it worth the price premium? We don't think so. If you're absolutely sure you want to get the C3 model, we'd suggest waiting closer to Black Friday. If you're not married to the C3, however, the LG B3 is still one of the best TVs out there, and if it was between this TV and another non-OLED TV in this same price bracket, the decision, at least to us, would be obvious.
