The police confirmed on Saturday that a 5-year-old girl and a woman in her 30s were being treated for serious injuries and were still in the hospital; two other children were treated for less serious injuries, the police said.

Although the authorities have not publicly identified the citizenship of the attacker, whom witnesses described as a man in his 50s, rumors spread online claiming that he was an immigrant, drawing many members of the far right to central Dublin on Thursday, some holding signs reading “Irish Lives Matter.” The protest quickly escalated, and roughly 500 people, mostly young men, vandalized cars, looted shops, and attacked hostels and hotels where immigrants were thought to be staying, according to the authorities.

By the end of the night, the police had deployed 400 officers and arrested 34 people, in what has been described as the worst rioting in the country in years. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said that those behind the violence had brought shame to Ireland.

It was not lost on many of those who rushed to buy Mr. Benicio a proverbial beer that an immigrant had intervened in an attack that then inflamed anti-immigrant sentiment. As of Saturday afternoon, the campaign, on GoFundMe, had attracted more than 31,000 single donations — many of which were for €5 or €6, or the average price of a pint. </textarea>
