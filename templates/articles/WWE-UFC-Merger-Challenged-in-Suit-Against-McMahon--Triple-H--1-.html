                <textarea id="text" readonly> A pension fund sued Vince McMahon and other senior leaders of World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. , challenging its $21.4 billion merger with Ultimate Fighting Championship, the mixed martial arts giant owned by media and talent conglomerate Endeavor Group Holdings Inc.

The shareholder lawsuit, filed in Delaware, says McMahon “used his domineering personality and control over WWE” to orchestrate an unfair transaction after storming back to its helm early this year from a six-month exile tied to allegations that he spent decades sexually harassing and abusing female subordinates.

McMahon, “maneuvering to secure his power and control over the company in the face of mounting stockholder discontent and government investigations,” spurned higher offers in favor of a deal with Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel, his “longtime friend,” that would keep him in charge of his wrestling empire, the suit says.

A board stacked with loyalists then “conjured up a sham sales process designed to favor Endeavor and exclude other bidders seeking to axe McMahon,” according to the proposed class action filed on behalf of former WWE investors by the Laborers’ District Council and Contractors’ Pension Fund of Ohio.

The transaction giving former WWE investors a 49% stake in its new parent company, Endeavor subsidiary TKO Group Holdings Inc., closed in September, allegedly five months after the final details were hammered out at Wrestlemania 39 in April.

The lawsuit also targets other board members at the time of the transaction, including McMahon’s son-in-law Paul Levesque—a retired WWE champion who wrestled under the name Triple H—and company president Nick Khan. McMahon and Khan now sit on the TKO board, with McMahon as executive chairman.

WWE didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. Endeavor and TKO aren’t named as defendants.

‘Unchecked Power’

McMahon is no stranger to litigation Delaware’s Chancery Court, the leading US forum for M&A disputes. The partly redacted 71-page legal complaint—and another filed a few days later that’s still under seal—marks the fourth round of shareholder allegations lodged there in recent years against the wrestling mogul.

Some of the previous court fights concerned WWE’s broadcast licensing deals with Saudi Arabia and alleged financial entanglements among McMahon, his wrestling business, and a version of the XFL minor league football organization that he briefly revived in early 2020, just before the Covid-19 pandemic scuttled the effort.

Most recently, WWE investors sued the company and McMahon over his January return to the company, when he allegedly ousted certain board members and replaced them with cronies. The shareholders leading those cases—which also involved harassment and hush money claims—dropped them after McMahon repaid the company $17.4 million, although they’re still seeking legal fees for their alleged role in forcing his hand.

According to the new complaint, that “coup” was the first step of McMahon’s plan to escape legal scrutiny without stepping away from wrestling. The same day he returned, he allegedly announced a strategic review and reached out to Emanuel, who made a tentative offer weeks before the company invited competing bids.

Although three all-cash proposals from unspecified suitors ended up coming in higher, the board didn’t even bother to make counteroffers because they would have forced out McMahon, who “wielded unchecked power at WWE,” the lawsuit says. Had the company engaged with the other bidders, they likely would have offered even more, according to the court filing.

Unfair Process, Unfair Price

McMahon ultimately used his majority stake in WWE to force the deal through without putting it to a shareholder vote or setting up an independent board committee, the suit says. “Unsurprisingly, this unfair process led to an unfair price,” according to the complaint.

The lawsuit also takes aim at other terms of the transaction, including the financial analyses used to justify the price and multimillion-dollar payouts to Khan, Levesque, and former chief financial officer Frank Riddick III.

Moreover, most of the business synergies used to justify the merger price stem from a services agreement with Endeavor that had little to do with the broader transaction, the complaint says. As a result, “merging WWE with UFC was likely unnecessary to achieve them,” according to the court filing.

TKO’s stock price, meanwhile, has crashed from greater than $103 the day the merger was completed to close at $78.50 on Nov. 24. That’s below the lowest of the all-cash bids, the suit says.

It was made public Nov. 22 after being filed under seal Nov. 17. The related lawsuit—filed by Dennis Palkon, one of the shareholders who sued over McMahon’s return—was filed under seal Nov. 20.

Block & Leviton LLP is counsel for the pension fund. Palkon is represented by Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP.

The case is Laborers’ Dist. Council & Contractors’ Pension Fund of Ohio v. McMahon, Del. Ch., No. 2023-1166, complaint unsealed 11/22/23. </textarea>
