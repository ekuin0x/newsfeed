NEW DELHI: Star batsman Suryakumar Yadav on Saturday expressed his gratitude towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the encouraging words after India's ICC ODI World Cup 2023 final loss. Suryakumar, who is also known as Mr 360, asserted that the team remains committed to maintaining that same spirit as they now gear up for the upcoming T20 World Cup next year.India's dream of winning the ODI World Cup after 12 years came crashing down after they suffered a six-wicket defeat against Australia in the final in Ahmedabad.In a heartwarming gesture, PM Modi visited the team's dressing room, met and consoled the players."Just after the World Cup final we were sitting in the dressing room and our Prime Minister Narendra Modi came in and gave us motivation," said Surya, who is currently leading the Indian team in the five-match T20 series against Australia."He met everyone and told us to move on, as it happens in sport and we will have to take it in our stride."It will take some time for us to get over it but his motivational words for those 5-6 minutes and meeting us is a big thing as he is the country's leader. We listened to him carefully, spent time with him and will try to follow his suggestions."The T20 World Cup will be hosted by the West Indies and the United States from June 4 to June 30 next year."We will try to do well in the upcoming tournaments and there is an ICC event coming up next year and we will play with the same spirit as this time and hopefully we will win," said Surya.The 33-year-old from Mumbai also thanked the fans for their support throughout the tournament."It has been just 4-5 days since the World Cup got over and all are disappointed, we are also disappointed. But it was great to see the support of our fans in India and all over the world."At the end of the day, it is a sport and it teaches us a lot of things. I want to say that keep supporting us." </textarea>
