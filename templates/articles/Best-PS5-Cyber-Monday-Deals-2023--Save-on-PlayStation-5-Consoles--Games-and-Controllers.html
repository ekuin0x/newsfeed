                <textarea id="text" readonly> Black Friday is technically over, but that means the Cyber Monday deals are gearing up — especially at Walmart. Starting today, November 26, Walmart's Cyber Monday deals are here and gamers can shop some of the biggest discounts on consoles, video games and accessories we've seen this year.

Shop Walmart's Cyber Monday PS5 Deals

If you're picking up a PlayStation 5 for yourself or someone on your holiday gift list this season, you'll definitely want to grab one of the Cyber Monday PS5 bundles at Walmart. They include the new PS5 Slim console packaged with one of the best games to play on it like Spider-Man 2 or Call of Duty.

Cyber Monday PS5 Bundle Deals

These PlayStation 5 bundles typically retail for $560, but Walmart has them on sale for $499. That’s the price of the brand-new PS5 Slim itself, so these gaming discounts are pretty incredible bargains. There’s no telling how long these PS5 Cyber Monday deals will last though, so be sure to snag your pick before stock runs out.

There is also a bundle deal with the PS5 Digital Edition in Walmart's Cyber Monday sale. The new PS5 Digital Edition starts at $450, but you can get the PS5 God of War Ragnarök bundle with a DualSense controller in gray camouflage for $510.
