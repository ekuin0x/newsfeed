                <textarea id="text" readonly> Ukraine has arranged with its partners that it will be receiving warships to ensure the safety of ships in the grain corridor in the Black Sea.

Source: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in response to questions from Ukrainska Pravda at the Grain From Ukraine conference in Kyiv on Saturday

Details: Zelenskyy said Ukraine considers the establishment of a grain corridor without Russia to be one of the most significant achievements of this year, and is also working to ensure the safety of the ships that use this corridor.

Quote from Zelenskyy: "We have reached agreements with our partners and will be escorting ships at sea to ensure their safety.

We have already made specific arrangements for receiving the ships. This is a matter of the near future."

More details: Zelenskyy said Odesa Oblast will be protected by additional air defence systems, which have already been agreed upon with Ukraine’s partners.

Quote from Zelenskyy: "Very specific systems and a very specific request have already been sent by [our] partners, and I can say that it has already been agreed.

Soon, this oblast will be protected by very powerful air defences.

It’s not just the ships that are important to us, but also the people who live there."
