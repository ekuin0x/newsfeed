Alienware Aurora R16 RTX 4070 Ti Gaming PC for $1749.99

New 2023 Model Alienware Aurora R16 Liquid Cooled Intel Core i7-13700F RTX 4070 Ti Gaming PC with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 1000W 80PLUS Platinum PSU 10% off $1,949.99 13 $1,749.99 See on Dell

The R16 is the newest Alienware Aurora gaming desktop for 2023. The R16 chassis is 40% smaller in volume compared to previous iterations. It features a simple yet proven airflow design; air is drawn in through the side intake vents over the GPU area as well as a 120mm rear fan drawing air in and a generously sized 240mm all-in-one liquid cooler exhausts air out through the top. A side benefit is that the GPU is supplied with fresh air from the outside instead of recirculating hot internal air. Speaking of which, the RTX 4070 Ti performs significantly better than the RTX 4070 or 3080. This is an ideal choice for playing games at high refresh rates at 1440p or for comfortable 4K gaming.

Alienware Aurora R16 RTX 4060 Gaming PC for $1099.99

Alienware Aurora R16 Intel Core i7-13700F RTX 4060 Gaming PC with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD 19% off $1,349.99 6 $1,099.99 See on Dell

This is an excellent price for the newest generation Alienware Aurora R16 equipped with a 13th gen Intel Core i7 Raptor Lake CPU and a current gen GeForce RTX 4060 GPU. The RTX 4060 is considerably more powerful than the RTX 3060 and almost nearly matches the RTX 3060 Ti. I would recommend this card for comfortable 1080p gaming although you can also run games at 1440p.

Alienware Aurora R16 RTX 4060 Ti Gaming PC for $1299.99

Alienware Aurora R16 Liquid-Cooled Intel Core i7-13700F RTX 4060 Ti Gaming PC with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD 19% off $1,599.99 0 $1,299.99 See on Dell

The RTX 4060 Ti 8GB video card is considerably more powerful than the RTX 4060. Compared to the previous gen GPUs, it's about 5%-10% faster than the RTX 3060 Ti at 1080p.

Alienware x14 and x16 Gaming Laptops Are on Sale

Alienware x14 R2 2560x1440 (QHD+) Intel Core i7-13620H RTX 4060 Gaming Laptop with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD 26% off $1,899.99 5 $1,399.99 See on Dell Alienware x16 2560x1440 (QHD+) Intel Core i7-13700H RTX 4070 Gaming Laptop with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD 33% off $2,399.99 2 $1,599.99 See on Dell Alienware x16 R2 16" 2560x1600 (QHD+) Intel Core i9-13900HK RTX 4080 Gaming Laptop with 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD 21% off $3,299.99 1 $2,599.99 See on Dell Alienware x16 R2 16" 2560x1600 (QHD+) Intel Core i9-13900HK RTX 4090 Gaming Laptop with 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD 16% off $3,799.99 1 $3,199.99 See on Dell

The Alienware x-series laptops are thinner, sleeker versions of their m-series counterparts. They're also quite powerful. In fact, the GPUs used in the x-series laptops are identical to the ones used in the m-series, so gaming performance is about the same. There is a slight tradeoff in the CPU; the x-series laptops uses i7 H-series CPUs and the m-series uses the more powerful i7 HX-series CPUs. The performance difference is pretty negligible, however, and in return you get a nicer looking, more portable machine.

Alienware m16 RTX 4070 Gaming Laptop for $1399.99

Alienware m16 16" 2560x1600 (QHD+) AMD Ryzen 9 7845HX RTX 4070 Laptop 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD 33% off $2,099.99 11 $1,399.99 See on Dell Alienware m16 16" 2560x1600 (QHD+) Intel Core i7-13700HX RTX 4070 Laptop 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD 30% off $1,999.99 5 $1,399.99 See on Dell

This Alienware m16 laptop features a 16" 2560x1600 QHD+ display, your choice between the Intel Core i7-13700HX or AMD Ryzen 9 7845HX processor, GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, 16GB of DDR5-4800MHz RAM and a 1TB NVMe SSD. If you're not married to a brand, I'd recommend the Ryzen CPU because it's a superior performer. The AMD Ryzen 9 7845HX CPU features a 5.2GHz max boost clock with 12 cores, 24 threads, and a sizeable 76MB cache. This is one of the fastest CPUs around. The RTX 4070 mobile GPU performs on par with the RTX 3080. It's a little bit faster than the RTX 3070 Ti but not quite as powerful as the RTX 3080 Ti. You'll need this kind of power to run games comfortably on the laptop's beefed up QHD+ display.

Dell XPS RTX 4060 Ti Gaming PC for $1299.99

32GB RAM and 3TB of Combined Storage

New Dell XPS Intel Core i7-13700 RTX 4060 Ti Gaming PC with 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 2TB HDD 28% off $1,829.99 19 $1,299.99 See on Dell

This Dell XPS PC is equipped just as well as any Alienware gaming PC but in a simpler and more understated chassis. It features an Intel Core i7-13700 CPU and GeForce RTX 4060 Ti GPU, which are great components for the price. Even better, though, is that this PC comes with a whopping 32GB of DDR5 RAM as well as dual storage drives: a 1TB NVMe SSD boot drive and a 2TB 7200RPM hard drive for storage.

Dell G15 RTX 4060 Gaming Laptop for $899.99

Dell G15 15" AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS RTX 4060 Gaming Laptop with 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD 31% off $1,299.99 3 $899.99 See on Dell

This is the least expensive RTX 4060 gaming laptop that's listed on Dell right now. The G-series laptops are less expensive than their Alienware counterparts, but they still make excellent gaming rigs. This particular laptop is outfitted with an AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. The RTX 4060 mobile graphics card sits right in between the RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti in terms of performance. That's a lot of power for a sub-$1000 laptop. It gives you plenty of oomph for running games on the native 1080p display.

Alienware m16 RTX 4090 Gaming Laptop for $2799.99

Alienware m16 16" 2560x1600 (QHD+) Intel Core i9-13900HX RTX 4090 Laptop with 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD 20% off $3,499.99 10 $2,799.99 See on Dell

This Alienware m16 laptop comes equipped with a 16" 2560x1600 QHD+ display, Intel Core i9-13900HX CPU, GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, 32GB of DDR5-4800MHz RAM and a 2TB NVMe SSD. The 4090 is far and away the most powerful mobile GPU availble by a huge margin. It's roughly equivalent to a desktop RTX 3090 / RTX 4070 Ti GPU. In real world terms, this GPU is more than capable enough of handling any game at the display's native QHD+ resolution at framerates of 60fps and beyond, even with ray tracing enabled.

The Alienware AW3423DWF is one of only two QD OLED gaming monitors that Dell sells. This 34" monitor sports a 3440x1440 WQHD resolution with a 1ms response time and 165Hz refresh rate. It uses a Samsung quantum dot OLED panel. Quantum dot, or "QD", OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy and range and wide viewing angles that OLEDs are known for.

This monitor is both VESA DisplayHDR 600 and G-SYNC Ultimate certified. G-SYNC "Ultimate" monitors contain an even higher-end NVIDIA processor built into this monitor for better HDR.
