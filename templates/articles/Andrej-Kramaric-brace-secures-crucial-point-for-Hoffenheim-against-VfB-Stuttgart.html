                <textarea id="text" readonly> An Andrej Kramaric goal either side of strikes from Serhou Guirassy and Wataru Endo earned Hoffenheim a point in a thrilling 2-2 draw with VfB Stuttgart in Sinsheim.

Hoffenheim 2-2 VfB Stuttgart

Goals: 1-0 Kramaric 11' (assist: Angelino), 1-1 Guirassy 45+5' (assist: Ahamada), 1-2 Endo 77' (assist: Ahamada), 2-2 Kramaric 90'+4

Red card: Ahamada 78'

After conceding three times in the final 20 minutes against Union Berlin on their way to a 3-1 defeat last time out, Hoffenheim started well on home turf. Within 11 minutes, they were in front, as Kramaric acrobatically volleyed Angelino's first-time cross beyond Florian Müller. The opening period was broken up by a series of injuries, though, as Hoffenheim's Robert Skov and Stuttgart's Tiago Tomas were forced off and replaced by Kevin Akpoguma and Chris Führich respectively. Die Kraichgauer lacked precision in attack, and were made to pay for that wastefulness shortly before the interval. They had been warned when Silas stung Müller's palms with a fierce drive, and Stuttgart were back on level terms shortly after via Guirassy, who buried Naouirou Ahamada's through-ball with aplomb.

Stoppages in play were again frequent after the break, with Silas needing to depart the field with an issue shortly before the hour mark. Even without the 24-year-old, however, the visitors looked the more likely to score as the game progressed, taking the game to their opponents. Führich was particularly dangerous, first firing a ball across the face of goal before forcing Oliver Baumann into an albeit easy save with an effort from just outside the area. Stuttgart's tenacity paid dividends with a little less than 15 minutes remaining, as Endo curled a lovely shot beyond Baumann's grasp to complete a stunning turnaround. Ahamada, who had provided the assist for both Stuttgart strikes, was sent off in the aftermath of the winner, and his delirious celebrations were in vain as Kramaric struck in injury time to secure a point for Andre Breitenreiter's men.
