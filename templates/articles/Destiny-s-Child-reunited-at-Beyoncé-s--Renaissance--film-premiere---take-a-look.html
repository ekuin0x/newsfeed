Former members of Destiny's Child stepped onto the chrome carpet at Beyoncé's "Renaissance" film premiere.

The highly-anticipated event occurred on Saturday at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Samuel Goldwyn Theatre in Beverly Hills, California.

Initially called Girls' Tyme, Destiny's Child underwent different lineup changes between 1997 and 2006. Six women performed with Destiny's Child during that period: Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, LeToya Luckett, LaTavia Roberson, and Farrah Franklin.

All but Farrah arrived at the premiere to publicly support Beyoncé, who didn't pose for photos at the event, but her silver floor-length Versace ensemble was showcased on Donatella Versace's Instagram page.

Kelly wore a similarly-colored silver gown by Jean Paul Gaultier, while Michelle, LaTavia, and LeToya opted for elegant black ensembles. Bishme Cromartie designed Michelle's ensemble, LaTavia wore a dress by Temraza, and LeToya wore a gown by Rick Owens.

Fans clamoring for more Destiny's Child moments can look toward the "Renaissance" film, which shows all the members but Farrah reuniting at the Houston stop of the Renaissance World Tour this summer. The scene was teased in a new film trailer released on Thursday.

"It was like a new birth for us, and a lot of healing," Beyoncé said in the film's narration, according to The New York Times.

When Destiny's Child released their first two studio albums — "Destiny's Child" and "Writing's on the Wall" — in the late 90s, the group consisted of Beyoncé, LeToya, LaTavia, and Kelly. However, LeToya and LaTavia left the group in 1999 amid controversial circumstances involving Beyoncé's father, Matthew Knowles, who also served as the group's manager.

LeToya and LaTavia felt Matthew favored Beyoncé and Kelly and claimed they were not paid fairly. The pair requested a change in management but were replaced by Michelle and Farrah, who remained a part of the group for six months.

Beyoncé, Kelly, and Michelle would become the most popular iteration of Destiny's Child, releasing hit singles like "Survivor," "Lose My Breath," and "Cater 2 U."
