KBS 2TV’s new historical drama “Korea-Khitan War” also earned its highest ratings yet for its sixth episode, which climbed to an average nationwide rating of 7.8 percent.

Meanwhile, tvN’s “Castaway Diva”—which has just one week left in its run—rose to an average nationwide rating of 7.995 percent ahead of its final week.

Finally, KBS 2TV’s “Live Your Own Life” climbed to an average nationwide rating of 17.7 percent for the night, making it the most-watched program of any kind to air on Sunday.
