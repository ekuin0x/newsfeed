                <textarea id="text" readonly> UPDATE: Nov. 27, 2023, 7:35 a.m. EST This story has been updated with new deals/prices on items like headlamps, camping gear, tents, outdoor pizza ovens, and more.

Laptops, tablets, robot vacuums, and all those tech things are nice. But sometimes, you want to disconnect and go outside to enjoy the crisp fall air and the sunny skies. If you're planning on spending some time hiking, camping, or even fishing in the near future or this summer, now's the best time to shop all things outdoors.

This Cyber Monday, brands like Lowes, Home Depot, Cabelaâ€™s, Bass Pro Shops, and REI are serving up deals on everything from backpacks to boots and all the gear you need to explore a new trail or camp out under the stars. Of course, Amazon has no shortage of its own outdoorsy deals (many of which we've included in this post!).

Each aforementioned retailer has been dropping sales ahead of the big day for weeks, and now it's officially time to dig into their proper Cyber Monday sales. Below, we've highlighted some of the best deals on outdoor goods that you can find right now. We'll continue updating this list as additional deals drop throughout Cyber Week, so be sure to keep checking back for more.

Note: All newly added deals are marked with a âœ¨, while deals with a ðŸ”¥ have dropped to an all-time low price. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.

Best tent deals

Why we like it

This sturdy four-person tent is lightweight yet stable, with two doors and double-wall construction. It's simple to set up with color-coded poles and trims for less confusion, and it also boasts a high ceiling and pockets to hold all your gear. It has plenty of space and it's easily up and ready to go so you can stop and take a rest from whatever you're doing as soon as it's convenient.

Best cooler deal

Why we like it

This massive cooler has enough room to keep all your drinks chilled and then some. Its unique design boasts a built-in solar panel that you can use to top off your phone and whatever else you need to charge up, too. It even has a built-in bottle opener to help you crack open a cold one. It has four cup holders, a folding handle and divider tray for the interior, and thick foam walls to make sure your ice lasts longer for frosty, refreshing beverages.

Best hiking gear deal

Why we like it

This REI Co-op pack takes gear organization and storage to a whole new level: with 6 exterior pockets and a generous main compartment, there's room for all your essentials, whether you're going on a day trek or overnight hike. With trekking pole keepers, an ice axe loop, and an included raincover for unexpected storms, this pack is suited for all terrains (and seasons). It also features padded hip belts and harnesses, ensuring your comfort and stability.

Best camping stove deal

Why we like it

Senior Shopping Reporter Haley Henschel reviewed the Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0, a slightly larger model than the Ranger, and she said it was "sleek, lightweight, and just a tad too expensive." Which means the more budget-friendly model that's also discounted for Cyber Monday is a win.
