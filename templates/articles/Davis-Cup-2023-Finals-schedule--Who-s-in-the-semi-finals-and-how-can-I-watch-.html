Novak Djokovic led Serbia to victory over Great Britain on Thursday, but there was controversy after the 2-0 win as the World No 1 clashed with the British fans.

Djokovic turned to the fans and said: “Learn how to respect players, learn how to behave yourself,” before adding, “no, you shut up, you be quiet” after they started playing the drums during his on-court interview.

Here’s everything you need to know and here are the latest odds and tips.
