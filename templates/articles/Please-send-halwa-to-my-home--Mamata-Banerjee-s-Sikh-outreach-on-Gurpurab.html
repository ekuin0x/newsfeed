She wished the Punjabi community on the occasion and said, “I have only one request for Gurpurab. Please send halwa to my residence."

She also asked the community to write a fresh letter so she can provide the property they have demanded for constructing a Guru Nanak Bhavan at just one rupee. “You have asked for Guru Nanak Bhavan but that property is of Rs 6 crore so we can’t provide that property, but I suggest you write a fresh letter and say that you want to do some charity work there like langar and all. Then I will give this Rs 6 crore property to you for one rupee.”

Speaking on the connection between Punjab and Bengal, she said, “Bengal and Punjab’s history is related. Bengal and Punjab have provided the most freedom fighters. That is why both are connected. Rabindranath Tagore wrote Jana Gana Mana and uttered Punjab first.”
