                <textarea id="text" readonly> LANSING, MI -- An Otsego County woman’s disappointment soon turned to elation after she won a $1 million jackpot playing the Michigan Lottery’s Cashword Times 20 instant game.

“I stopped at the gas station to buy a few Daily 4 tickets,” said Bonnie Hitchings, 67, of Johannesburg. “When I was checking out, I asked for the Win $100, $200 or $500 ticket, but they were sold out, so I got a Cashword Times 20 ticket instead. I scratched the barcode and scanned the ticket three times. I kept getting a message to file a claim at the lottery office, so I assumed their scanner was broken and went out to my car to scan it on the Lottery app.

“When I scanned the ticket, confetti came up on the screen with a message saying I won $1 million. I went back into the store to show the worker and everyone in the store was so excited. Everywhere I go lately I have people stopping to congratulate me. It’s a crazy and exciting feeling!”

Hitchings bought her ticket at the Shell gas station, located at 1025 West Main Street in Gaylord. She visited Lottery headquarters in Lansing recently to claim her prize and elected to receive the money as a one-time, lump-sum payment of $634,000 rather than the annuity. With her winnings, she plans on taking a trip to Alaska and investing the remainder.

The last players from Michigan to win a Mega Millions or Powerball jackpot is the Wolverine FLL lottery club which claimed a $1.05 billion jackpot in March 2021. With their winnings, the group plans to give back to the community.

And while they were lucky winners, it’s smart for players to check their tickets immediately as a winner worth $1 million sold in Warren in 2021 went unclaimed. The money instead went to the state’s School Aid Fund.
