                <textarea id="text" readonly> 10h ago 15.07 GMT Pep Guardiola: “That was an excellent performance,” says City’s manager in an interview with the BBC. “I am really proud that after eight years we are still playing that way. We were really good in all departments and needed to be against an incredible team. “Maybe we missed the last pass a little bit but they defended really well. To concede just two shots on target against Liverpool is a big compliment for the way we work.”



11h ago 14.57 GMT Jurgen Klopp: “It’s a really good moment,” says Liverpool’s manager in an interview with Sky Sports. “It’s a tough place to come – it’s no coincidence that they win that many home games. You’d need more time to prepare for the game properly, especially in these kind of circumstances. “We’re still in a process. If we’d played really well today, we could have won – we didn’t. We played OK. We caused them problems as well, but our good moments didn’t feel that good to us [in the first half]. We had to stretch ourselves again [in the second half]. We adapted our positioning slightly. Unfortunately we lost Diogo [Jota], with Ali we’ll have to see. “I told the boys at half-time, imagine what it would be like if we were playing well. We had to settle a little bit. Putting Trent in a different position defensively, plus Dom [Szoboszlai] and Mo [Salah] closing that gap in the second half gave us much more stability. From there we could play football ourselves. “We had good moments. I wish we could have had more. For the moment we’re in, we should take the point as a success. I have nothing to complain about there. Trent made a difference today. Before we start talking about positioning, I think it helps us having him on the right wing from time to time.”



11h ago 14.42 GMT Trent Alexander-Arnold: “It’s definitely a result that’s better than what we got here last year,” says Liverpool’s goalscorer in an interview with Sky Sports. “We havern’t had too many good results here in general, to be honest. It’s a points game and we’ll take the point because it wasn’t an amazing performance from us at all. We take the point and there was positives. We had chances to win the game. “I don’t think we played particularly well, first half especially. TYheir formation and the way they set up really challenged us. They have a lot of bodies in there and it’s difficult to play afgainst them. We regrouped at half-time and came out with a bit more of a game plan to press them. It’s always difficult because subconsciously when you play against Manchester City you’ve got a lot of respect for them and the way they play. “You think you can’t really get tight to their players and you stand off them a little bit. That seemed to be the problem in the first half. In the second half we put that respect to the side to try to get a result and that’s what we did.”



11h ago 14.34 GMT A quick recap: Perhaps it’s down to the early kick-off time or the international break, but this was a very odd, occasionally entertaining game that neither team seemed hugely fussed about winning. There was precious little urgency from either side, even after Manchester City went ahead through Erling Haaland. Liverpool conjured up a fine equaliser through Trent Alexander-Arnold and were able to resist some late pressure from their hosts in added time. Liverpool will be pleased with the draw but look like they might be without their first choice goalkeeper for a few weeks, as Alisson pulled up in the dying seconds with what looked like a case of hammy-twang. Sunderland’s ancient record of 24 consecutive home wins remains intact, as City have failed to win today after 23 victories on the bounce at the Etihad.

11h ago 14.27 GMT Full time: Manchester City 1-1 Liverpool Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeep! It’s all over at the Etihad, where the points have been shared. City stay top of the table, with Liverpool just a point behind them in second.



11h ago 14.25 GMT 90+8 min: Oof! Haaland gets his head to an Alvarez corner but sends his glancing corner narrowly wide of the far post.



11h ago 14.24 GMT 90+7 min: Alisson goes down holding his hamstring but will have to see the game out because Liverpool have used all their substitutes.



11h ago 14.23 GMT 90+6 min: Phil Foden sends a cross wide to give Liverpool a little breathing space after a sustained period of pressure from the home side.



11h ago 14.22 GMT 90+5 min: Bernardo Silva has a thunderous shot from the edge of the Liverpool penalty area blocked by Joel Matip as City search for a late winner.



11h ago 14.21 GMT 90+4 min: Haaland gets on the ball down near the corner flag but his attempted cross is blocked and the ball goes out for a throw-in.



11h ago 14.20 GMT 90+2 min: A slightly weird game threatens to peter out with the players on the pitch and the fans in the stands all seeming fairly lethargic. There’s another six minutes of added time due to be played, so somebody from either side might be able to conjure up a winner.



11h ago 14.17 GMT 88 min: Akanji goes down holding his head after an airborne tussle and the ref stops play. City’s players complain because a promising attack is stopped and Bernardo Silva’s name goes into the book for dissent.



11h ago 14.15 GMT 86 min: Joel Matip is booked for a foul on Doku as the City winger tried to jink his way into the Liverpool penalty area from the left. From the ensuing free-kick, City win themselves a corner. Alisson does well to gather the inswinger and is bundled over the line with the ball in his hands by Akanji. Free-kick for Liverpool.



11h ago 14.13 GMT 85 min: Liverpool double-substitution: Endo and Harvey Elliott on for Alexis Mac Allister and Darwin Nunez. Liverpool have used all five available substitutes while City haven’t used any of theirs.



11h ago 14.11 GMT 83 min: City win a free-kick in a promising position but Julian Alvarez fires his effort into the defensive wall.

11h ago 14.10 GMT 81 min: There’s been a conspicuous lack of urgency from both sides in this second half and City might be forced to pay a heavy price for theirs. Their failure to put Liverpool to the sword has allowed Liverpool back into the game courtesy of Alexander-Arnold’s strike. The Liverpool full-back was teed up by Mo Salah, with no Manchester City defenders anywhere near him. Alexander-Arnold runs to the Liverpool fans, who are rightly going bonkers.

11h ago 14.06 GMT 79 min: Liverpool break upfield with Mo Salah feeding the ball out wide to Tsimikas on the inside left. He cuts inside but his cxross is a poor one. Ruben Dias cuts it out with a header.



11h ago 14.05 GMT 77 min: Phil Foden gets caught in the face by the trailing arm of Luis Diaz as the two players contest the ball. It’s a free-kick for the home side, just inside their own half. Kyle Walker sends the ball long and Liverpool clear.



11h ago 14.04 GMT 75 min: Tracking back in a bid to put a stop to Phil Foden’s gallop, Darwin Nunez gets the first booking of the game for fouling his rival. Free-kick for City, wide on the right. Haaland makes a near post run to get in front of Mac Allister but heads Julian Alvarez’s delivery over the bar.



11h ago 14.00 GMT 71 min: Alisson isn’t having one of his better games in a Liverpool shirt and can consider himself a mite fortunate that Dias’s goal was ruled out. Akanji wasn’t exactly clambering all over him and the Liverpool goalkeeper made a total pig’s ear of his effort to deal with the cross.



12h ago 13.58 GMT Manchester City 1-0 Liverpool It’s as you were. Alisson flapped at an inswinging corner under pressure from Manuel Akanji and Ruben Dias was on hand to tap home at the far post. The goal doesn’t stand as Akanji is adjudged to have fouled Alisson.



12h ago 13.56 GMT GOAL! Manchester City 2-0 Liverpool (Dias 67) City double their lead from the set-piece but there’s a VAR check for a foul on Alisson. The goal is disallowed.



12h ago 13.55 GMT 67 min: Doku is released into space again and gets the better of Joel Matip. His final ball into the penalty area is found wanting again and Liverpool hack clear for a corner.



12h ago 13.54 GMT 67 min: A Rodri piledriver from outside the penalty area strikes Ryan Gravenberch on the backside and City’s players appeal en masse for handball and a penalty. They are forced to make do with a corner, from which nothing comes.



12h ago 13.51 GMT 63 min: Jeremy Doku gets on the ball again after Nathan Ake intercepts a Ryan Gravenberch pass towards Diaz. He plays the ball wide to Alvarez but fails to make the run to the far post to meet the ensuing cross. Goal kick for Liverpool.



12h ago 13.49 GMT 61 min: Ruben Dias comes perilously close to poking a Szoboszlai cross from the right past his own goalkeeper and into the back of the net while trying to prevent the delivery reaching Luis Diaz. He gets away with conceding a corner instead and City clear their lines.



12h ago 13.48 GMT 59 min: In the City penalty area, Nathan Ake slides in to take the ball off Darwin Nunez’s toe. The ball goes out off the Liverpool player but his side are incorrectly awarded a corner. Nothing comes of it and a potential controversy is mercifully avoided.



12h ago 13.46 GMT 57 min: City attack on the break again as Foden sends Doku on his way from a Liverpool corner. The winger’s first touch is a poor one and a back-pedalling Alexis Mac Allister is on hand to snuff out the danger. Phil Foden on the move. Photograph: The Guardian

Updated at 13.48 GMT

12h ago 13.44 GMT 56 min: City get the ball launched into the Liverpool penalty area and a poor headed clearance from Trent Alexander-Arnold sets up a half-chance for Haaland. His shot on the turn from 18 yards sails over the bar.



12h ago 13.42 GMT 55 min: Jurgen Klopp rings the changes as Luis Diaz and Ryan Gravenberch come on for Curtis Jones and Diogo Jota.



12h ago 13.41 GMT 52 min: In acres of space on the left, Doku receives a crossfield pass from Alvarez and gives Alexis Mac Allister the slip. He checks his run and tees up the Argentinian on the edge of the penalty area. Alvarez shoots high over the bar.



12h ago 13.39 GMT 52 min: Liverpool are dominating the early stages of this second half and win themselves a corner. Kostas Tsimikas sends the ball into the penalty area, where Ederson plucks it from the air and tries to send Phil Foden upfield on a counter-attack.



12h ago 13.38 GMT 50 min: Mo Salah cuts in from the right towards the byline, getting the better of Nathan Ake. Akanji is quick to get over and give his teammate a dig-out, shepherding the ball out of play as he gets between it and the Egyptian.



12h ago 13.37 GMT 49 min: On the touchline, Jurgen Klopp is ranting and raving at his players, urging them forward and instructing them to play with a little more urgency. Jurgen’s not happy. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian

Updated at 13.47 GMT

12h ago 13.36 GMT 48 min: Manuel Akanji is forced to hoof the ball out of play for a throw-in after good work down the right by Trent Alexander-Arnold.



12h ago 13.35 GMT 47 min: It’s an extremely low key start to the second half in a ground where the atmosphere seems curiously muted considering City are on top. We can probably put that down to the early kick-off.



12h ago 13.34 GMT 46 min: City are looking for their 24th consecutive home win and will equal a record held for well over a century by Sunderland if they take all three points today.



12h ago 13.32 GMT Second half: Manchester City 1-0 Liverpool 46 min: Liverpool get the second half under way and will feel reasonably confident that they can turn things around. There are no changes in personnel on either side.



12h ago 13.25 GMT Erling Haaland: The Norwegian required just 48 games to score his 50th Premier League goal. Andy Cole, next on the list of quickest half-centuries, took 65 games. In mitigation, Cole will no doubt point out that he didn’t take penalties.

12h ago 13.20 GMT Half-time: Manchester City 1-0 Liverpool Peep! Chris Kavanagh blows his whistle to bring an absorbing half to a close with Manchester City leading courtesy of Erling Haaland’s 50th Premier League goal. A poor kick-out from Alisson gifted possession to City and after excellent work from Nathan Ake, the combined forces of Liverpool’s goalkeeper, Virgil van Dijk and Joel Matip were unable to prevent Erling Haaland scoring his latest landmark goal after just 48 league appearances for his club.

Updated at 15.02 GMT

12h ago 13.17 GMT 45+1 min: With a low Szoboszlai shot heading wide, Ederson inexplicably tries to “save” the ball and palms it into a danger area just outside his own six-yard box. Kyle Walker scrambles it cleasr before anyone in a red shirt can react. It’s half-time.



12h ago 13.15 GMT 43 min: Phil Foden brings a smart save out of Alisson who dives to his left to palm the ball around the upright after the City winger had cut inside from the right and unleashed a low, fizzing drive. It was heading for the bottom corner.



12h ago 13.13 GMT 41 min: A rogue pass from Kyle Walker drops at the feet of Alexis Mac Allister. He plays it forward to Szoboszlai, whose shot is blocked. Manchester City advance upfield on the break with Doku on the ball and Haaland and Alvarez either side of him. He plays the ball left to Alvarez, who tries to pick out Haaland at the far post. His cross sails wide and a great opportunity for City to double their lead goes to waste.



12h ago 13.10 GMT 39 min: Looking back at the goal, it seems Van Dijk and Matip could have done more to stop Haaland as he ran on to Nathan Ake’s pass. Each seemed to leave him for the other to stop and the City striker made the most of their indecision.



12h ago 13.09 GMT 37 min: Doku picks up a wonderful pass upfield from Bernardo Silva and puts Trent Alexander-Arnold on the back foot again. He cuts inside the defender again but is unable to pick out the killer pass.



12h ago 13.06 GMT 35 min: Darwin Nunez shoots wide from a very tight angle after good work by Szoboszlai, who had pounced on a loose pass from Manuel Akanji and scurried upfield.



12h ago 13.05 GMT 33 min: Doku surrenders posserssion to Trent Alexander-Arnold, who picks out Darwin Nunez with an inch-perfect 30-yard pass upfield. City’s players appeal for handball but referee Simon Hooper doesn’t blow his whistle. Nunez advances upfield and plays the ball wide to Salah when he should have tried a shot himself. Salah runs into traffic and City clear up at the back.



12h ago 13.02 GMT 31 min: Bernardo Silva plays the ball up the left flank, picking out Doku. He cuts inside Alexander-Arnold but his cross is blocked and put out for a corner by Joel Matip. Nothing comes of the set-piece.



12h ago 13.01 GMT 30 min: For the record, that was Erling Haaland’s 50th Premier League goal. He’s banging them in at a rate of more than one a game.



12h ago 13.00 GMT 28 min: Attempting to send his side upfield on the counter-attack, Alisson kicked the ball straight to Nathan Ake. The City defender slipped Haaland in behind with a pass between two defenders and a sublime first touch enabled the big Norwegian to get the ball out from under his feet and fire past Alisson. The goalkeeper got something on the ball but was unable to keep it out of the bottom corner. Erling Haaland becomes the fastest player to hit 50 Premier League goals. Of course.
