                <textarea id="text" readonly> Black Friday is officially behind us, but some deals are lingering, and more discounts are now popping up thanks to Cyber Monday. In other words, opportunities to save cash on new products still exist, and if you're looking for a way to buy Samsung's best value-for-money phone of 2023 at an even lower price, you can! Here's all you need to know.

Here's the deal: The Galaxy S23 FE costs $629 without a trade-in or a carrier agreement. However, if you use the official Shop Samsung mobile app, you can buy the Galaxy S23 FE for just $539.

And if this is the first time you're using the Shop Samsung app to make a purchase, you're eligible for an extra $25 discount.

To get the app, hit the “Buy” button below and visit Samsung's online store on a mobile device. Then, install the Shop Samsung app when prompted and use it to purchase the Galaxy S23 FE.

Story continues after our Galaxy S23 FE review video

Regardless of whether you use the Shop Samsung app or not (although you should, for extra savings), you can also save up to $400 on a new Galaxy S23 FE when you trade in an old device.

Realistically speaking, you might not want to exchange the Galaxy S22 for a $400 discount on the Galaxy S23 FE. The S22 is arguably a better phone. However, you can get a $300 discount if you trade the Galaxy S20 FE or a $350 price cut for the Galaxy S21 FE 5G. And the Galaxy S23 FE is a definitive upgrade over those.

More good deals for a good-value phone

As usual, if you're eligible for the Samsung Offer Program, you might be able to save more cash. In fact, right now you can save up to an extra $94.50 when you buy the Galaxy S23 FE through the Offer Program.

Last but not least, if you'd like to buy a new pair of earbuds and/or a smartwatch along with the Galaxy S23 FE, bundling them saves you $50 on the Galaxy Buds FE and up to $190 on the Galaxy Watch 6.

Cyber Monday or not, these are all good offers for the Galaxy S23 FE, which already has a reputation for offering great value for money. Hit the “Buy” button below before it's too late and these deals expire, and don't forget about the Shop Samsung app trick. </textarea>
