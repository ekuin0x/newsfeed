                <textarea id="text" readonly> Pakistan have flown to Sri Lanka to play a three-match ODI series against Afghanistan starting on August 22. Here are the fixtures list, match timings and venues | AFG vs PAK ODIs.

Sri Lanka is all set to host a three-match bilateral series between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, between August 22 and 26. Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium in Hambantota and R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo are the preferred venues for the epic clashes.

The UAE and India have hosted Afghanistan’s matches in the past, but owing to possible difficulties in acquiring visas for Pakistan players in India, SLC was approached.

Afghanistan have named an 18-member squad under the leadership of Hashmatullah Shahidi. Teenage spinner Noor Ahmad has made a comeback, bolstering their already potent spin-arsenal comprising the duo of Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rehman.

Pakistan have meanwhile arrived in Sri Lanka with an 18-member squad headed by Babar Azam. Saud Shakeel has sealed a berth in the white-ball squad on the back of his purple patch in Test cricket, in the recently concluded series against Sri Lanka. The squad will be downsized to a 17 members, excluding Shakeel, for Asia Cup 2023 starting from August 30.

In recent years, the cricketing fraternity has witnessed some fiery exchanges whenever the two arch-nemeses have taken the field. Jingoistic fans and onfield banters have all contributed to the rivalry. It will be a cracker of a series.
