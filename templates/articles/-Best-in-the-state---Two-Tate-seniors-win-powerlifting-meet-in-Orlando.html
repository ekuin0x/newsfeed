                <textarea id="text" readonly> There are a couple of state champions out of Tate High School.

Connor Laughlin and Izek Keodouangdy both won their respective weight classes at the 2023 USA Powerlifting Florida State Championships, held in mid-November in Orlando. Laughlin competed in the 165-pound (75 kilogram) class while Keodouangdy was in the 148-pound (67.5 kilogram) weight class.

Laughlin won with a squat of 474 pounds, a bench of 270 pounds and a deadlift of 578 pounds pounds. Keodouangdy had a squat of 468.5 pounds, a bench of 275.6 pounds and a deadlift of 578.8 pounds.

Keodouangdy also set American records in the squat, bench and deadlift. His deadlift was also a world record, but there was not an official judge at the meet to verify the world record. So, for now, it’s considered an unofficial world record.

“It was my first time at a state meet,” Keodouangdy said. “It was cool to go against people that have good standards and totals that I could compete against.”

The pair of powerlifters got each other into powerlifting within the last couple years. Now seniors, Keodouangdy played football and basketball in his early high school years. He played football with Laughlin, but it “wasn’t anything serious.”

While playing football, they would have weight training during the school day.

“I didn’t know anybody, so I stuck with Connor and he just made it enjoyable.” Keodouangdy said.

Both lifters work out at The Bar Strength & Conditioning Gym in Milton, and are part of a specific program. At first, Laughlin said he just wasn’t happy with his body and wanted to get in better shape.

Then he got Keodouangdy involved into the powerlifting side of things. Both have been competing for about a year and a half, Laughlin said.

“Now we’re both the best in the state of Florida,” Keodouangdy said.

Eyes on nationals

It’s a unique training regimen for Keodouangdy and Laughlin. Both are at The Bar six days a week, and have pretty strict diets. Both of them also noted the mental aspect of powerlifting – especially with how repetitive training can get sometimes.

“I try not to stress over stuff because the mental side can take a toll on your strength, too,” Keodouangdy said.

Laughlin noted that between meets, he likes to train for about 24 weeks. Leading up to the meet in Orlando, he had about six weeks.

“I wasn’t expecting much, really,” he said. “I wasn’t thinking about doing states until all my friends wanted me to.”

The duo now has plenty of time to prepare for its next meet, however: the 2024 USA Powerlifting High School Nationals, which will be held in April in Baton Rouge.

“I want to be No. 1 at nationals,” Laughlin said.

“I want to become a national champion there, and not just break the deadlift world record – but the squat, bench and total world record,” Keodouangdy said. “And place first in the world.”
