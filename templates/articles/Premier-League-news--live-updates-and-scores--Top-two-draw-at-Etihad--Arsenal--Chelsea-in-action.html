Mauricio Pochettino labelled Chelsea performance during the 4-1 defeat to Newcastle United earlier today as his side's "worst performance of the season."

Despite an eye-catching first-half free-kick from Raheem Sterling giving Chelsea a foothold in the game, goals from Alexander Isak, Jamaal Lascelles, Joelinton, and Anthony Gordon, as well as a 73rd-minute red card for club captain Reece James, sealed an emphatic win for Eddie Howe's side.

The defeat, Chelsea's fifth in the league this season, leaves Chelsea in 10th place and Pochettino criticised the London club's performance.

In an interview with the club's website, the 51-year-old said: "It wasn’t our best game. In fact, I’d say that was probably our worst performance of the season. It was really tough to be in the stands today and not be able to influence things. I think both teams weren’t at their best levels but we absolutely cannot complain about the result.

"We didn’t read the game from the beginning and we didn’t play the way that we should or in the way we expect. That’s very disappointing. We showed a lack of intensity today and that’s disappointing, especially when we had got ourselves back in the game with Raheem’s goal.

"We didn’t have the intensity required and I think we made it too easy for Newcastle. That is why I am so upset and frustrated with not only the result but also the performance. That has to be much, much better because today was our worst performance of the season and that’s very disappointing."

Pochettino challenged his side to learn from the defeat at St James' Park ahead of their game against Brighton and Hove Albion next Sunday.

He said: "It’s one for us to learn from. We have certain levels that are required of us and it’s important we get back to those as soon as possible, and sometimes you need a situation like today to make you realise what it takes.

"We are a young, talented squad but regardless you have to compete every time you step on the pitch. Those are the fundamentals and we have to learn from this." </textarea>
