                <textarea id="text" readonly> CEO of Tesla and SpaceX Elon Musk shared his personal phone’s wallpaper on X (Twitter) a couple of days after the 2nd Starship launch event on Saturday.

This phone wallpaper is a rare piece of information from Elon Musk’s personal belongings that the world’s richest man has ever shared. We can learn a few things from this screenshot about his phone preferences.

However, we cannot determine a lot by seeing a lock screen wallpaper of Elon Musk’s personal phone which is most probably one of the latest editions of the Apple iPhone. Looking at the phone’s lock screen (pic below), we can see that Elon Musk keeps his phone in “Do Not Disturb” mode.

Of course, he’s one of the busiest people alive today. Hence, he does not want to be disturbed. The Do Not Disturb mode mutes all notifications from apps, especially the messaging ones like WhatsApp, etc.

In addition to blocking constant nagging by notifications, Do Not Disturb mode enables the phone user to select friends and family as favorites. The phone will only ring when your favorite contacts call or message you, otherwise, it will remain silent.

I am also a fan of the Do Not Disturb mode and keep my phone in this mode 24/7. This allows me to focus on work and avoid distractions. I am sure it does even better for Elon.

Still hard to believe Starship is real pic.twitter.com/YJCRGrPNS7 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 24, 2023 Elon Musk shares the same Starship 2nd launch image without his iPhone lock screen.

Elon Musk and SpaceX achieved their milestone of reaching the stage separation phase with the 2nd Starship launch. Musk is enjoying this success by remembering it every time he unlocks his phone.

We can see that all of the 33 Raptor V2 engines are firing on Starship 25 as it lifts off the launch pad. In the first flight, some of the engines malfunctioned but it wasn’t the case this time.

Looking at Elon Musk’s personal phone’s lock screen we can see that he uses AT&T as his carrier. Musk’s phone was not using Wi-Fi while taking this picture and is using a 5G+ cellular internet connection. For security and privacy reasons, it’s possible that he never uses a Wi-Fi connection to avoid connecting his phone to a local area network (LAN).

Elon Musk has compared Tesla cars to an iPhone multiple times. He claims that Teslas are to cars just like Apple’s iPhone is the rest of the phones. The leading edge in technology and innovation.

“Have driven a Tesla Model S 50 miles now. It’s clearly the iPhone of cars—by far the best car ever made,” Elon Musk tweeted this in 2012 when the first Tesla Model S was in limited production.

Thanks! “@ev: Have driven a Tesla Model S 50 miles now. It's clearly the iPhone of cars—by far the best car ever made." — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 19, 2012 Elon Musk’s historical tweet saying that a Tesla Model S is the iPhone of cars. History has proven him right after 11 years.
