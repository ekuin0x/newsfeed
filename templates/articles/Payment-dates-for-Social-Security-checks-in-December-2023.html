                <textarea id="text" readonly> The Social Security Administration sends payments to different beneficiaries each month, including retired workers, survivors, and those receiving disability benefits from the Supplemental Security Income program and Social Security Disability Insurance.

The SSA is preparing to wrap up its monthly payments for 2023, as the agency has already finished sending out payments for November. Here are the payment dates for the last month of the year.

Some beneficiaries to receive two payments in December

Based on SSA’s payment schedule, SSI benefits are generally sent on the first day of each month. However, if the first day of the month falls on a Saturday or Sunday, payments are sent on the last Friday of the previous month. This will be the case for SSI payments for January 2024.

Since the first day of January falls on a weekend, the payment corresponding to that month will be sent on the last Friday of the previous month; that is, December.

The Social Security Administration’s regular schedule of payments

On the third day of every month , the SSA sends money to those who began receiving their Social Security payments before May 1997. If day three is a weekend, the payment is advanced to the previous Friday.

The rest of the Social Security checks are sent based on the birthday of recipients, including retired workers, as well as recipients of survivors’ and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments.

Second Wednesday of the month: recipients with a date of birth from the 1st to the 10th

Third Wednesday: beneficiaries born from the 11th to the 20th

Fourth Wednesday: beneficiaries born from the 21st to the 31st

Payment dates for Social Security checks in December 2023

Taking this schedule into account, these are the payment dates for Social Security checks for the last month 2023. The payment that SSI beneficiaries will receive on Dec. 29 will already reflect the increased rate based on the cost of living adjustment that was determined in October, since that payment is for January of the coming year. </textarea>
