                <textarea id="text" readonly> Jean Knight, the R&B and funk singer behind the 1971 hit "Mr. Big Stuff," has died. She was 80.

"New Orleans and the music world mourns the loss of one its most treasure musical daughters, Jean Knight," her family said in a statement to USA TODAY shared via the Stax Museum of American Soul Music on Sunday. Knight died Wednesday, her family confirmed.

Knight, born Jean Caliste, released her first song, a cover of Jackie Wilson's song "Stop Doggin' Me Around" in 1965. Her success climbed in 1971 with the release of "Mr. Big Stuff," which landed her a deal with Stax Records.

"'Mr. Big Stuff,' which became famous for the infectious refrain, 'Who do you think you are?', wasn't just a chart-topping anthem; it was the product of soulful, syncopated melodies that echoed through the Crescent City," Knight's family wrote in the tribute.

The hit sold over one million copies and earned her a Grammy Award nomination in 1972 for best female R&B vocal performance alongside Diana Ross, Janis Joplin, Freda Payne and the category winner Aretha Franklin.

Knight's family praised her connection to her fans, writing, "Her concerts were not just performances but celebrations of the enduring bond she shared with those who appreciated her music. Whether in the intimate venues of the French Quarter or on the grand stages of global music festivals, Ms. Knight made every fan a cherished part of her extended musical family.

"Jean Knightâ€™s legacy is not just a musical one; it is a testament to the enduring love between an artist, her hometown, and the fans who adored her," the family concluded. "As we bid farewell to this iconic soulstress, New Orleans and her global fan base join together in gratitude for the indelible mark she left on the world." </textarea>
