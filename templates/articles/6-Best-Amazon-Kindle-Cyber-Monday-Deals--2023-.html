                <textarea id="text" readonly> We love Kindles. It's a gadget that gives you access to thousands of books in an instant and isn't meant to do anything but good old reading. They're discounted during most deals holidays, including Cyber Monday. Our Kindle guide has more details if you aren't sure which model to get. We've also rounded up the Best Ebook Readers overall (spoiler: the Paperwhite tops that list, too).

We test products year-round and handpicked these deals. The discount amounts we show are based on actual street prices at retailers in the past few months. Products that are sold out or no longer discounted as of publishing will be crossed out. We'll update this guide periodically.

If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.

Kindle Deals

We tested the Signature Edition Paperwhite (8/10, WIRED Recommends), which has wireless charging capabilities and 32 gigabytes of storage. This matches the price we saw during Amazon Prime Day, but is $10 more than last Cyber Monday. The standard Paperwhite is $120 ($20 off), but you lose waterproofing and auto-adjusting warm lighting.

The base Kindle is the cheapest and smallest one you can get, and it's still a solid device if you don't want to spend over $100. It was slightly cheaper in October at $75, but this is $5 less than it was last year.

There isn't a good excuse to spend this kind of money on a Kindle anymore, and we're not sure if this 2019 model will be updated eventually, but we love the physical page-turn buttons. It's $20 cheaper than it was during Prime Day, but we saw a much larger discount last year when it dropped to $165.

This is the best kid Kindle, but we've seen much better deals; last year it dropped to $105, and it was $110 during Prime Day. Kids Kindles comes with a case, a two-year no-questions-asked replacement guarantee, and a year of Amazon Kids+. The base Kindle Kids is $100 ($20 off), but it isn't waterproof.

Kindle Scribe Photograph: Amazon

The Kindle Scribe (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is far too expensive and large for most of us, but if you want an ebook reader that doubles as a notebook, it works well. For $30 more, the premium pen automatically triggers the eraser tool when you turn it around, so there's less time spent switching between tools on-screen. It's not waterproof, which is an odd omission at this price, and you can't write directly on most booksâ€”you still need to use the sticky note feature.

If you want a better way to hold your Kindle, the Strapsicle can help. The soft silicone straps attach to the back of your e-reader and give you a better spot to rest your hands. It comes in multiple sizes depending on your e-reader. </textarea>
