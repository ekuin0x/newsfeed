JAMMU: An impressive Nagar-Kirtan was on Tuesday taken out in Jammu city by the members of Sikh community in connection with the ensuing birth anniversary of Shri Guru Gobind Singh Ji Maharaj. Hundreds of people from various parts of Jammu participated in “Nagar Kirtan.”

The procession began from Gurdwara yadgaar Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, Chand Nagar. After passing through major areas of Jammu, it culminated at Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha, Guru Nanak Nagar Jammu.

Thousands of Sikh devotees took part in the Nagar Kirtan. A ‘palki sahib’ was leading the procession in which Sri Guru Granth Sahib (the holy scripture of Sikhs) was carried on a beautifully decorated vehicle along with ‘Nishaan Sahibs’ (religious flags).

The ‘Panj Pyaras’ (five beloved ones) in their traditional attire were the cynosure of attraction all along the procession.

The other major attraction of the procession was the display of Gatka, a Sikh martial art, and other breathtaking sword exercises all along the procession. The District Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, Jammu, which had organised the Nagar Kirtan, managed the procession well and various stalls of food and refreshments were also arranged by different business and social organisations on the route. </textarea>
