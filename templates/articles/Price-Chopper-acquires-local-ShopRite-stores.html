ALBANY — Price Chopper has finalized the purchases of the leases, store equipment and fixtures of the five former local ShopRite stores.

In a statement released Tuesday morning, the company said it expected to convert two of the shuttered stores — in Niskayuna and North Greenbush — into sites for Market 32, its high-end brand.

The deal marks the end of the mystery about what company would purchase the five ShopRite stores, which closed in mid-November.

“Our Market 32 brand has been extremely well-received and this gives us an excellent opportunity to expand our footprint in the Capital Region,” said Blaine Bringhurst, the president of Price Chopper/Market 32.

The company plans to try to sublease the Slingerlands location at the Vista Technology Campus since Market 32 already has a popular "award winning" location on Route 85.

It is still weighing what to do with the former Central Avenue ShopRite locations in Albany and Colonie — both of which are in close proximity to existing Price Chopper stores in the Westgate and Colonie plazas.

However, Price Chopper/Market 32 said it would not operate the gas stations at those two former ShopRite locations should they be made into new locations.

ShopRite had been in the Capital Region market for 12 years, with mixed results since some stores were stronger than others. Most of the properties were built by Columbia Development and BBL of Albany, which later sold the properties to out-of-town investors. ShopRite leased the space at each of its local stores from those landlords.

John MacAffer, an associate broker for CBRE Real Estate who represents the landlord of the Niskayuna location, said that ShopRite was always busy and was an excellent anchor for the plaza and helped drive traffic to other tenants such as restaurants. He said the landlord wasn't worried about the rental income because ShopRite had to still pay for its lease, but having another strong supermarket like Market 32 come in instead of having an empty box sitting there was the best possible outcome

"We're thrilled," said John MacAffer, associate broker at CBRE. "It's big."

The past decade has been a period of growth for Price Chopper/Market 32.

In early 2021, the chain announced its merger with Williamsville-based Tops Friendly Markets, forming a grocer with nearly 300 stores throughout the Northeast and 32,000 employees.

The Federal Trade Commission's review of that deal required the divestiture of 12 stores. C&S Wholesale Grocers has agreed to purchase those locations, including stores in Cooperstown, Saranac Lake and Warrensburg. (Other stores that were sold at that time were located in Cortland, Norwich, Owego, Peru, Rome, Rutland, Vt., Sherrill, South Watertown and Watertown.)

The combined company, which operates as Northeast Grocery, is based in Schenectady.

ShopRite closed its local stores earlier this month, ending its 11-year run in the local market.

When it was revealed in October that the chain planned to exit the Capital Region, ShopRite told vendors it expected to close its stores by Dec. 9. But the chain did not restock and ran out of most products by mid-November.

The closures eliminated 567 jobs in the Capital Region, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notice posted on the state Department of Labor’s website.

At the time of the closure, ShopRite suggested it was selling the locations to another buyer. While the company emptied its shelves of products, the fixtures remained behind, which suggested the potential buyer would also be in retail.

Frank De Riso, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1, which represented some of the ShopRite employees, said he believed Price Chopper/Market 32 would look at the lease terms, sales volume, and condition of the newly acquired buildings in Colonie and Albany before deciding what to do with them.

He added that his union for several months has been looking to organize employees in the Price Chopper/Market 32 chain. Tops stores are already unionized. </textarea>
