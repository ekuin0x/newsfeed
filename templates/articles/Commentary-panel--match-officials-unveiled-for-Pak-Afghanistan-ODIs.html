                <textarea id="text" readonly> KABUL: The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) on Sunday, unveiled the commentary panel and match officials for the three-match ODI series between Pakistan and Afghanistan, scheduled to commence on August 22.

The seven-member commentary panel featured former Pakistan captain and renowned cricketing voice, Ramiz Raja.

Ramiz will be accompanied by his compatriot Aamer Sohail in the panel which also features Farhad Fidaee, Sri Lanka’s Farveez Maharoof, David Gower, HD Akerman and Devender Kumar.

The ACB also announced the match officials for the first-ever bilateral ODI series between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Former Sri Lankan cricketer Ranjan Madugalle will serve as a match referee for the entirety of the series while Bismillah Jan, Izat Safi, Ahmad Durrani, Nitin Menon, Peter Manuel and Sharfuddoula will officiate the matches.

Earlier this week, Ramiz Raja was snubbed from the commentary panel of the upcoming Asia Cup 2023.

Notably, the former Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ramiz Raja, who returned to commentary after an almost two-year hiatus during Pakistan’s two-match away Test series against Sri Lanka last month, was not named in the panel.

Soon after assuming the charge of the PCB chairman, Ramiz took a break from the commentary and remained involved in running the affairs of the cricketing body till his ouster in December 2022.

Despite his ouster, Ramiz Raja did not immediately return to the commentary role and missed the eighth edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) and the home series against New Zealand.

Notably, the three-match ODI series against Afghanistan will serve as an ample opportunity to prepare for the upcoming Asia Cup, scheduled to run from August 30 to September 17 in Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

This year’s Asia Cup will kick off with host Pakistan taking on Nepal in the curtain raiser on August 30 in Multan.

Pakistan will host a total of four matches including a Super 4s fixture while the rest of the nine matches will be played in Sri Lanka.
