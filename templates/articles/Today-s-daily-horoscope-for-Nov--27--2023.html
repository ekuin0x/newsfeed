The moon named for the industrious architects of the animal world is a reminder that daily activities can change everything. Beavers don’t set out with the goal of creating and maintaining biodiverse wetlands, but taking care of themselves and their families, they critically influence the ecosystem. Nurturing your own growth can have benefits to others you’ll never know about.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). The pettiness that used to bother you now seems humorous, if you even think of it at all. Now that you’ve risen above such things, you’re putting out a lighter, brighter energy. It’s attracting new people to your life, too.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). You’ll see value in what was discarded. Without you, it would be overlooked. But once you take up the challenge, all you need is a bit of work and a little creativity to turn this into a thing of beauty and use.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). Events stir your loyalties. Before you launch a quest for justice, honor or protection, make sure you know all the facts. New information will surface. Stay alert while you gather information. Do not overreact.

PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20). The day is a game of “hurry up and wait.” Whatever you’re doing in the lulls, make sure it’s something you can squarely drop when suddenly everything is happening at once.

ARIES (March 21-April 19). Productivity depends on keeping a vision in your mind’s eye. If you’re having trouble staying on track, physical reminders like signs and totems will help. Also, add details to update and refresh your mental picture.

TAURUS (April 20-May 20). There are potential mentors all around. You’re still figuring out how to capture and keep their attention. Don’t pass up the chance to practice your presentation. Every time you make your pitch, you learn something.

GEMINI (May 21-June 21). You’ll reflect on your values, though not in a formal way. It happens naturally as you react to life’s amusements, listen to the conversations of the world and express yourself as you go, which teaches you who you are.

CANCER (June 22-July 22). Napoleon Bonaparte suggested one should never interrupt the enemy who is making a mistake. You’ll witness errors from various parties. Consider carefully your strategy about when to correct, and when to just watch.

LEO (July 23-Aug. 22). In every poker game, there comes a point when even the one with the best cards feels like it’s time to go home. Anyone can cut losses. It takes real grace to know when to cut your gains.

VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). Disagreements are not always a bad sign. Friction can exist in perfectly healthy and productive relationships. The rub doesn’t have to stop the action. Friction can be worn down, greased up or used to polish the stone.

LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). Coping mechanisms are skills. Some of the habits you developed to get you through difficult passages can be applied in other places to help you, help others and probably both simultaneously. You’ll be paid, too -- maybe not in dollars.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). Each day is a unique journey, but today’s may feel more like a commute. Repetitive scenery will lull your mind to autopilot. For insight and invigoration, wake up your senses with an alternate route.

TODAY’S BIRTHDAY (Nov. 27). The sunshine is in you, so you won’t have to quest for it, only draw it up. Your radiant smile will light up rooms with positivity and hope. Improvements and a boost in earning will spring from your dedication to lifelong learning. You’ll feel at home wherever you travel with takeaways that are material, spiritual and social. Aries and Virgo adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 7, 45, 11, 19 and 20.

CELEBRITY PROFILES: Last year, famous guitar players gathered to celebrate the 80th birthday of Jimi Hendrix and honor him with sold-out concert performances. Over 50 years since his passing, Hendrix is still widely considered to be the greatest guitarist of all time. Hendrix was born when the sun, Mercury and Venus were in the passionate and adventurous fire sign of Sagittarius. “Excuse me while I kiss the sky.” -- Jimi Hendrix
