Whether you game on Xbox, PlayStation 5, Switch, PC, or mobile, dozens of great controllers are on sale for Black Friday. Many of these are listed for their lowest price of the year--so if you're looking to upgrade your gamepad or need something new for Player Two, this is the time to shop. Keep in mind that some of these deals will likely sell out--so browse quickly if you want to beat the competition.

One of the best Black Friday controller deals is for the DualSense, which is on sale for $49 in every color. That matches its lowest price ever. If you're looking for something flashy, consider picking up the Cosmic Red or Galactic Purple models, which look striking next to the standard white PS5 console.

A similar promotion is going on for Xbox controllers, with a massive list of Microsoft products included in the Black Friday shenanigans. Several Xbox Wireless Controllers are $40 (down from $70), and you'll find nice price cuts on the Elite Series 2 (down to only $107) and Elite Series 2 Core.

Be sure to check out third-party gamepads, as the incredibly popular 8BitDo Ultimate is also on sale for a great price.

Plenty of other Black Friday controller deals are available, and you'll find our favorites below. </textarea>
