                <textarea id="text" readonly> Snoop Dogg smoked a blunt in the backseat of a black SUV after having dinner in Santa Monica on Wednesday night nearly a week after he fooled many into believing he was giving up the habit.

The 52-year-old rap superstar had enjoyed a hearty Italian meal at Giorgio Baldi with his famous friend, Don Cheadle.

The Oscar nominee - turning 59 next Wednesday - flashed a smile after hanging out with Snoop (born Calvin Broadus).

Don and Dogg have been friends for at least five years since he won a $100 chili-eating contest while appearing on VH1's Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party back in 2018.

Cheadle was rocking a black leather jacket over a matching T-shirt and jeans as well as a gleaming white pair of sneakers.

Back at it! Snoop Dogg smoked a blunt in the backseat of a black SUV after having dinner in Santa Monica on Wednesday night nearly a week after he fooled many into believing he was giving up the habit

Meanwhile, the 16-time Grammy nominee showcased his love of cannabis in a shiny green jacket, white durag and sneakers, as well as matching Death Row AOP $88 'Weed Hoodie' and $69 'Weed Joggers.'

Last Thursday, Snoop - who boasts 185.6M social media followers - issued a shocking, sober statement reading: 'I'm giving up smoke. After much consideration and conversation with my family, I've decided to give up smoke. Please respect my privacy at this time.'

By Monday, Dogg revealed he was just trying to go viral to hype the ad campaign for Solo Stove's $349.99 limited-edition 'The Snoop Stove - Bonfire 2.0 + Stand.'

'I know what you're thinking: Snoop! Smoke is kind of your whole thing!' the Long Beach native clarified.

'But I'm done with it. I'm going smokeless. Solo Stove fixed fire. They take out the smoke.'

By Thursday, Snoop shared a video of himself happily smoking a blunt and dancing along to Peso Pluma and Jasiel Nuñez's 2023 song Lagunas before telling the camera: 'Happy Thanksgiving!'

Dogg will next produce and star as Jaycen Jenning in Charles Stone III's football comedy The Underdoggs - hitting US theaters January 26 - for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

The That's How We Ballin rapper will also executive produce and voice Scratch in John D. Eraklis and Tara Nicole Whitaker's long-delayed animated musical Pierre the Pigeon-Hawk.
