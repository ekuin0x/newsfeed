                <textarea id="text" readonly> As Auburn fans prepared to storm the field of Jordan-Hare Stadium, Alabama secured a shocking 31-yard touchdown in the final minute, propelling it to a 27-24 victory over Tigers in what stands out as one of the most jaw-dropping finishes of the college football season.

The Crimson Tide keep its College Football Playoff hopes alive, with No. 1 Georgia next on the slate in the SEC championship game in Atlanta. Alabama struggled to capitalize on fourth-quarter opportunities, with a bad snap and a 5-yard penalty moving the Crimson Tide back to the 31-yard line on fourth-and goal in the waning minutes. Quarterback Jalen Milroe managed to do the unthinkable, finding receiver Isaiah Bond in the back left on the end zone for the game-winning touchdown.

Milroe finished with 259 passing yards, 107 rushing yards and two passing touchdowns. He routinely made impressive throws not only on intermediate routes but also on deep balls, connecting with Jermaine Burton for a 68-yard touchdown in the second quarter.

Auburn and coach Hugh Freeze leaned on their running game, notching 244 rushing yards but just 93 passing yards. Running backs Jarquez Hunter and Damari Alston gave the Crimson Tide defense fits, finishing with a combined 178 rushing yards. The Tigers offense and defense came up with big plays time and time again in a game that should have left Auburn fans rejoicing on the gridiron after storming the field. However, the Crimson Tide will march on to the SEC title game after stealing this game at Jordan-Hare Stadium in the final moments.

Final: Alabama 27, Auburn 24

6:02 p.m.: Unbelievable ending to this football game. Thorne fumbles the football, moving the ball back to the 1-yard line. With the clock at one second, Thorne takes a shot down field, intercepted by Terrion Arnold to keep the Crimson Tide's College Football Playoff hopes alive.

5:56 p.m.: Another timeout by Auburn.

5:54 p.m.: Milroe cannot find anyone and goes beyond the line of scrimmage before throwing, and takes a 5-yard penalty. Fourth and very long for the Tide.

5:44 p.m.: The Auburn defense is coming up with big play after big play. On second-and-11, Marcus Harris gets his seventh sack of the year, a 9-yard loss for the Tide.

Auburn, Fumble: Tigers 24, Crimson Tide 20

3:56 p.m.: Auburn's biggest play of the day comes from Damari Alston, who explodes through a gap down the left sideline for a 56-yard run. A facemask at the end of the play adds 15 yards to the end of the play. Auburn is at the 12-yard line.

3:52 p.m.: Auburn cornerback Nehemiah Pritchett beautifully gets his hands in the way of a Milroe pass on third-and-4 to break up the completion and force an Alabama punt.
