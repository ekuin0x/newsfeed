The United States may not have topped the podium as much as Australia at the 2023 World Championships (seven gold medals vs. 13 for the Aussies), but their swimming depth in 2023 has been unmatched.

So far this year, there’s an American swimmer ranked top-10 in 33 of 34 Worlds events — all but the men’s 400-meter freestyle, where David Johnston is ranked 14th (3:45.75), according to Nuoto Mondiale’s rankings for men, women, and non-Olympic events. In total, the U.S. boasts 85 swimmers in the top 10 of Worlds events, 41 more than Australia. China is the third-deepest nation this year with 32 swimmers in the top 10.
