                <textarea id="text" readonly> Cyber Monday isn't just a time to shop for discounted TVs and gifts for your family members. It's also a time to get fantastic deals on our favorite sex tech devices. Not only has the WIRED Gear Team tried and tested all of these gadgets, but we've also vetted the deals for you. You're welcome.

We test products year-round and handpicked these deals. The discounts we show are based on actual street prices at retailers in the past few months. Products that are sold out or no longer discounted as of publishing will be crossed out. We'll update this guide periodically.

Vibrator Deals

Be sure to check out our Best Sex Toys and Best Vibrators guides for more.

Dame Pom Photograph: Dame

The Dame Pom has been one of our top vibrator picks (8/10, WIRED Recommends) after a couple of years of testing, and it's not often that it comes down in price. This semi-squishy vibrator is small enough to fit in your palm, covered in a super-soft silicone shell, and has a raised ridge for delivering targeted stimulation. This is one of the few vibrators that works really well, no matter what genitalia you have.

Dame Arc Photograph: Dame

The Dame Arc is an internal vibrator, with an exterior shell of soft silicone, a curved body, and a broad, soft head. It's angled to deliver stimulation directly to the internal structures of the clitoris (the G-spot), and the broad head makes those vibrations feel rumbly and diffused instead of buzzy and targeted. It's a great pick for anyone looking for an internal vibrator, but the head is a bit wide, so use plenty of lube.

Dame Dip Photograph: Dame

The Dip is a small, discreet vibrator that fits easily in one hand. It's soft on the outside, it has a semi-tapered tip, and like the Pom it features a raised ridge along one side. The tip and the side ridge are great for delivering targeted stimulation that's as intense as you want it to be. During testing, I found that this is another one that works well with every body, and all genitalia.

Dame Com Photograph: Dame

The Dame Com is one of our top-rated wand vibrators for good reason (8/10 WIRED Recommends). It provides the power and broad external stimulation you expect from a wand-style vibrator, but it also features a slightly angled head curved to fit your body. The vibration is powerful enough to actually use as a muscle massager but still gentle enough to use as a sex toy. They're rumbly and deep and the exterior is coated in a silicone that's soft to the touch but just grippy enough to stay put in your hand.

Motorbunny Buck Photograph: Motorbunny

It's not for everyone, but if you're in the market for a Sybian-style machine, this one is a good pick. During testing, WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft found the Motorbunny Buck (8/10, WIRED Recommends) to be a fun—if sometimes loud—machine to have on hand. A typical Sybian-style machine features a vibrating saddle that the user straddles and grinds against, and the Buck can definitely be that, but it can also thrust. You can affix it with a variety of attachments and use it for penetrative play in addition to external vibration.

MysteryVibe Crescendo 2 Photograph: Mysteryvibe

MysteryVibe's Crescendo 2 is a flexible vibrator with six internal motors, one in each joint section. It's easily the most flexible vibrator we've tested, and it's also one of the best. The motors are as gentle or powerful as you want them to be and you can tune their intensity and pattern from the app. You can even set it to vibrate to music! It's extremely versatile, providing deep rumbly vibrations when used for internal or external use on any and all genitalia.

The Poco is like a tiny version of the Crescendo 2. It only has two internal motors, but that's still quite a few for such a small vibrator. It fits in the palm of your hand and has two joints so it's also pretty bendy. The internal motors provide a more buzzy sensation than the Crescendo 2, but that's not a bad thing. The buttons are easily identifiable by touch when in use, which is always a plus. Like the Crescendo 2, the Poco is great for all genitals and erogenous zones.

Unbound Nudge Photograph: Unbound

Unbound's Nudge is a slim little butt plug and it's our number-one pick for anyone just starting out with anal play. It's small enough to accommodate most beginners, has a sturdy flared base that keeps it safe and snug, and features a nice gentle taper.

Lelo's Ina 3 is a rabbit, a V-shaped vibrator that provides both internal and external stimulation at the same time, and it handles that double duty beautifully. I found the internal part of the rabbit tends to be a bit wide for some partners to comfortably use, but if you're looking for a real feeling of fullness and internal pressure, the Ina 3 is a good pick. The external arm of the Ina 3 is flexible so it naturally fits into position over the clitoris when in use.

Unbound Bender Photograph: Unbound

The Bender is a flexible vibrator designed for internal use, but because you can shape it to your body, it's also great for external use. It's waterproof so you can take it in the bath as well. It's not as powerful as a wand vibrator but the vibes are buzzy and intense, and it's blissfully quiet.

This is our favorite grinding vibrator—rather than being designed with penetration in mind, this one focuses on external pressure. Since the toy vibrates and “taps” simultaneously, it delivers a unique sensation. You'll have the choice between seven different speeds and three different programs—with gentle stimulation as an option.

The Hugo is ideal for a prostate, but it still works great even if you don't have one. It has six vibration modes, two motors, and 12 intensities. It also comes with a remote control, along with the ability to set it to motion-sensing mode to increase or lower the intensity by moving or tilting the remote. Since its size isn't intimidating, this one is good for beginners.

The Tenuto Mini (6/10, WIRED Recommends) is a lot smaller than its predecessor and functions as a phallus ring with a few extra features. It has three vibrating motors (two on the sides and one on top) and wraps around the base of the phallus. The body is semi-rigid but flexible enough to fit around an erect phallus comfortably. WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft says it's best for solo use or penetrative sex between you and a partner. You can also control speed and intensity via the connected app.

Air Pulse Toy Deals

Lelo Sila Photograph: Amazon

A mainstay of our Best Sex Toys guide, Lelo's Sila is a suction toy with a wide mouth, narrow body, and small overall profile. It's quiet when it's in use, but it's also not as powerful as you might expect or want. WIRED writer Louryn Strampe says the Sila provides a nice slow build with a big and satisfying payoff. If you're looking for a quicker orgasm, there are other suction toys we recommend, but for anyone who's a fan of a nice gentle ramp-up, the Sila is a great pick.

Dame's Aer is a suction toy. It uses air pressure to simulate the gentle sucking sensation you experience during oral sex, and it does a pretty good job at that. The body is coated in a soft but grippy silicone, and the mouth is wide enough to accommodate small erogenous zones of all types (clitoris, nipples, frenulum, etc).

Using air pulses to simulate the sucking sensation of oral sex, Satisfyer’s Pro 2 Gen 3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the quintessential suction toy. The silicone mouth is soft to the touch and about as wide around as the tip of my thumb, small enough to fit over sensitive erogenous zones like the clitoris, nipples, or frenulum, but also broad enough that the experience isn’t too intense. It also provides vibration as a sort of background stimulation which can definitely take things to another level.

The Satisfyer Penguin has always held a special place in my heart. It’s such a wonderful example of form and function coming together to help you, well, do the same. The Penguin is a small suction toy shaped like a penguin, with a detachable little bowtie. It’s less powerful overall than the Pro 2 Gen 3, but it’s plenty powerful enough to get the job done. Plus, it's a cute holiday edition!

The Sona 2 is shaped for comfortably holding in your hand and it's perfectly sized. There are also a number of intensities for almost all preferences. And, speaking of intensities, you can increase the Sona 2's intensity by pressing it hard against your body.

Lube and Accessory Deals

Read our Best Lubes guide for more recommendations.

Dame Aloe Photograph: Dame

This is one of our favorite water-based lubes. The bottle is textured so it doesn't get super slippery even if you have lube on your hands, and the pump nozzle dispenses just enough lube in each pump. The lube is slippery without a sticky finish—it's smooth and viscous enough that you don't need to use much at a time.

Pulse's automated dispenser saves you the trouble of messing with bottles and cold lube. Simply plug it in, load up the lube, and place your hand underneath the spout. It'll dispense the lube right away.

I was skeptical of this one before I tried it. Now that I have, though, I want to sing its praises any chance I get. It’s a relatively simple little stool with flexible bands you can sit on in a variety of positions, which deliberately leave some of your most sensitive anatomy exposed. You can do a lot of things with this chair, but most of all it’s just nice to have something that can make more elaborate sex acts or bondage scenes feel more comfortable. </textarea>
