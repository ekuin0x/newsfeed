                <textarea id="text" readonly> Erling Haaland’s goal against Liverpool on Saturday was his 50th in the Premier League — from just 48 games.

The Manchester City star is — by some way — the fastest player to reach a half-century of goals in the competition in terms of appearances.

Here, The Athletic breaks down the Norway striker’s feat, compares him to past penalty-box predators, and takes a look at the slowest players to hit the 50-goal mark.

Firstly, a look at how, and against who, the City forward has scored his 50 Premier League goals.

Haaland has scored 34 of his 50 goals with his left foot, six with his right foot, and 10 with his head.

The 23-year-old has scored against 20 of the 21 clubs he has played against in the competition, with Thomas Frank’s Brentford the exception. Haaland had just one shot in his only game against the London club (in November 2022) and registered five touches in the opposition penalty box.

Haaland reaching 50 goals in just 48 games means he has broken the existing record for the fastest to a half-century by 17 games.

If he had not scored against Liverpool, he would still have had until roughly mid-March to score the one goal needed to break the record.

The mark had been held since March 1995 by Manchester United’s Andy Cole, whose 50th goal came in 65 matches — with the Englishman reaching the milestone by scoring five times against Ipswich Town.

Below are the trajectories of the 10 fastest players to 50 Premier League goals. Haaland has been out in front almost from the start and his sensational debut season left little doubt that he would break Cole’s record.

Kevin Phillips was the second-quickest (behind Haaland) of these players to score 25 goals, but ended up 10th on the list.

Haaland has taken 1,104 touches during his Premier League career, which means he is scoring on average a goal every 22 times he touches the ball. For comparison, Salah averages 82.5 touches per goal since the start of last season, having had 2,393 touches in that period.

Haaland has taken 174 shots in this time — an average of a goal every 3.48 shots. Salah’s average is a goal every 5.6 shots.

Of the Norwegian’s 50 goals, 48 have come from inside the penalty box. While that seems a lot, it is not a record and five players scored all of their first 50 Premier League goals inside the area:

His two goals from outside the box came against Wolverhampton Wanderers in September 2022 and Brighton & Hove Albion last month.

The player to score the most of their first 50 Premier League goals from outside the box is David Beckham, with 29.

Haaland has scored five hat-tricks in the Premier League, with these goals making up 30 per cent of his total.

The chart below details every player to score five or more Premier League hat-tricks and how many goals they scored in total in the competition, with Luis Suarez the only other player with a goal total lower than 94.

The slowest player to reach 50 goals in the Premier League is the competition’s all-time record appearance maker — Gareth Barry. The midfielder reached the mark while playing for Everton in 2014.

Here is a direct comparison between Haaland and Barry’s trajectories to 50 goals:

Haaland has torn up a number of goalscoring records since joining City and few would bet against him continuing to do so.

Alan Shearer’s record for being the fastest player to 100 Premier League goals (124 games) will surely now come under threat, with Haaland needing to score 50 goals in his next 75 appearances to break it.
