                <textarea id="text" readonly> OnePlus has unveiled official images of its upcoming OnePlus 12 flagship smartphone on Weibo ahead of its December 5th launch event in China, revealing the handset will be available in three colors: white, black, and green. The design of the device appears visually similar to its predecessor, the OnePlus 11, though the Alert Slider — a fan-favorite feature that allows users to easily switch between mute, vibrate, and ringer sound profiles — is now located on the left-hand side of the phone instead of the right.

According to OnePlus, the relocation was made to accommodate a new integrated antenna that’s designed to boost signal performance and reduce latency for game streaming. “Based on internal testing, it has been determined that the optimal position for gaming antennas is between the forefingers of the user when the phone is held in landscape orientation,” says OnePlus in a press release. The OnePlus 11 has its Alert Slider in that exact spot, so OnePlus has moved the slider to the opposite side on the OnePlus 12 to improve antenna performance.

A machine-translated article from Yahoo Tech HK also reveals some of the OnePlus 12’s key specifications. This includes a new Sony LYT-808 sensor for its 50-megapixel main camera, and a 64-megapixel, 3X periscopic telephoto camera, both supported by Hasselblad Camera for Mobile. The OnePlus 12 will also feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor (confirming leaks from July), a “2K display” panel from China’s BOE, and support for wireless charging, rain touch, and infrared remote control functions.
