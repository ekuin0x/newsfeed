                <textarea id="text" readonly> Deniz Undav added to his incredible scoring run with a double against Eintracht Frankfurt that ensured the Eagles' sequence of 15 home games without defeat came to an end against a VfB Stuttgart side who made third spot their own.

Eintracht Frankfurt 1-2 VfB Stuttgart

Goals: 0-1 Undav 1' (assist: Millot), 1-1 Anton (o.g.) 26', 1-2 Undav 45'+1 (assist: Mittelstädt)

Buoyed by an impressive eight-game unbeaten run in all competitions, Frankfurt were in confident mood going into this Matchday 12 encounter at their Deutsche Bank Park fortress. Cue stunned home silence, then, when Stuttgart's Undav was seen wheeling away in celebration in the game's opening minute, the forward having guided Enzo Millot's through pass past Kevin Trapp. The hosts shook off that setback against their high-flying opponents and eventually managed to pull level, albeit in fortuitous circumstances. Alexander Nübel's loose delivery was pounced upon by Eintracht and when possession was worked wide to Philipp Max, his flighted cross was nodded into the air by Waldemar Anton, who could only look on in despair as the ball looped over his goalkeeper. Yet home celebrations were short lived. As the game headed towards half-time, an unmarked Undav had all the time in the world to head Maximilian Mittelstädt's chipped centre into the corner for his eighth goal in eight games across all competitions.



After picking up an injury in the first half, referee Felix Brych had to be replaced by Patrick Schwengers at the break. However, it was a different swap Stuttgart fans were eager to see, and they got their wish on the hour mark. Bundesliga scoring sensation Serhou Guirassy is being eased back to full fitness by coach Sebastian Hoeneß and although his presence offered the visitors extra energy after the forward's introduction, Eintracht still posed plenty of threat with Fares Chaïbi and Hugo Larsson sending respective efforts narrowly off target. Warming into proceedings, the 15-goal Guirassy finally hit his stride when sprinting clear onto Millot's through pass. An angled, chiped finish just swerved past the far post while moments later, Guirassy was frustrated again when Anton blocked the striker's shot on the line. For a VfB side who remain on the up this term, those misses would ultimately matter little.

Match stats

Undav's double brought his season tally to seven goals in nine Bundesliga appearances.

As many as three of Undav's Bundesliga goals this season have been headers.

Stuttgart have already won more games (nine) than they managed in the entire 2022/23 campaign.

Anton has now scored a combined total of five own goals in the Bundesliga and 2 Bundesliga.

Frankfurt's 15-game unbeaten run on home turf in the Bundesliga (eight wins, seven draws) ended here.

VfB are the only Bundesliga team yet to draw a game this season (W9, L3).
