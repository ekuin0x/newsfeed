MUMBAI: The Under-19 teams of arch-rivals India and Pakistan will clash on December 10 in a league match of the Under-19 Asia Cup in Dubai, which will host all the matches at the ICC Academy grounds, and one semifinal and the final at the Dubai International Stadium. The India Under-19 team will start their campaign against Afghanistan on December 8. After playing Pakistan U-19s, they will take on Nepal U-19s on December 12.The tournament will involve eight teams, including, interestingly, the Japan Under-19s too! The U-19 Asia Cup will be followed by the Under-19 World Cup, which was recently shifted from Sri Lanka to South Africa by the International Cricket Council.The semifinals of the U-19 Asia Cup will be held on December 15, while the final will take place on Sunday, December 17. The Indian Under-19 team for the tournament will be picked soon after the conclusion of the ongoing Under-19 Quadrangular in Mulapadu, where the India A & B teams are playing, besides England and Bangladesh U19s.Meanwhile, a superb 199 (165b, 21x4, 9x6) by Ansh Gosai powered India Under-19s B to a 70-run win over India A at the Under-19 Quadrangular in Mulapadu, Vijayawada on Friday.After being asked to bat first, India B scored 314 for eight in 50 overs, with Gosai, who was unlucky to miss out on a double hundred, dominating the show to the extent that the next-highest score in the innings was 35, by Kiran Chormale.
