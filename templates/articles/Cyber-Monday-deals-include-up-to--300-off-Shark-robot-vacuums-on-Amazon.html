The shopping event of the year isn’t over just yet, and if you’re looking for a robot vacuum to keep your home clean, one of Engadget’s favorites is on sale for a stellar price this Cyber Monday. Right now, you can get the Shark AI Ultra for half off, or $300 less than its $600 MSRP. For those in the market for a robot vacuum that can clean their floors too, Shark also offers a version of the AI Ultra with mop functionality built-in . After a 43 percent discount, that variant is currently $400, down from $700. Either way, those are excellent prices for a pair of robot vacuums that offer a compelling mix of features and cleaning performance.

As mentioned above, we like the Shark AI Ultra a lot here at Engadget, with both the standard and 2-in-1 models appearing in our guide for the best robot vacuums . In fact, we consider the Shark AI Ultra to be the best midrange pick for most people. Setup is easy. All you need to do is take the vacuum out of the box, plug in the base and download Shark’s companion app on your phone. Once the AI Ultra completed its first “explore run,” we found it was a reliable cleaner, doing its best to avoid any obstacles that were left on the carpet or floor. It was also much quieter than competing models in and around the same price range. However, the best feature of AI Ultra is that it comes with an auto-empty station, and one that features a bagless design. That means you won’t need to spend extra money on the AI Ultra over time.

As for the 2-in-1 model, its water-and-solution based cleaning abilities are basic, but beat having to bring out an old-school mop and bucket. In our testing, the AI Ultra Ultra 2-in-1 left our hardwood and tile floors noticeably cleaner. As I said, both models are great options, particularly when they’re as affordable as they are right now.
