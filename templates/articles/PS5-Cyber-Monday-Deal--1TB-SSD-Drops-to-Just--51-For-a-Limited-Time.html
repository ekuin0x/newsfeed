                <textarea id="text" readonly> There are a few new PS5 Cyber Monday Deals to check out right now, and that includes this brand new discount on a PlayStation 5 compatible solid state drive. This Lexar 1TB Gaming SSD (including a heatsink) has dropped to just $50.95 for Cyber Monday (see here), marking it as the best deal we've seen for a drive of this size during the extended Black Friday sales.

The only catch is this offer is only available until the end of the day today when Amazon will wrap up its latest sale period for the time being. So, if you're looking to expand the storage on that new PS5 slim you just picked up over the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, this is the perfect opportunity to save. Otherwise, there's also a 2TB SSD for $99.99 available right now as well. And, just to remind you again, these deals will be gone by this time tomorrow, so act now to avoid disappointment.

Is an SSD Worth it For a PS5?

The best PS5 SSDs are necessary as the PS5 has a measly 825GB to house a few storage-hungry games out of the box. The PS5 Slim improves on this with a base 1TB drive, but that still isn't going to fit a lot on there in the grand scheme of things.

A good chunk of the PS5’s 825GB SSD is taken up by the console’s system files, leaving you with a little over 650GB of usable storage space on the base console (this will differ on the slim model).

If you dedicate yourself to only a few games at a time, that’ll probably be enough. But if you like having several games on the go, or are a fiend for live service games that tend to balloon in size as more updates and content packs are added, you’ll soon find yourself hitting the limits of the PS5’s storage. At that point, get yourself an SSD.

More PS5 Cyber Monday Deals - Last Chance

There are plenty of other great PlayStation deals to consider this Cyber Monday (while they last), including a DualSense $49 deal, 30% off PS Plus, and over 50% off some of the very best PS5 games this year. The Spider-Man 2 PS5 slim bundles are currently the most popular offer so far this shopping season. These cost $499.99, so you're getting a free game, but are also very popular so we recommend securing one ASAP if you're interested.
