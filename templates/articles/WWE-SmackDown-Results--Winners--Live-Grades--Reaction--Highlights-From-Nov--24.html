Bianca Belair, Shotzi, Charlotte Flair, and Becky Lynch made their way to the ring to kick off SmackDown and, despite teased tension between the latter two, appeared to be on the same page.

Bayley, master manipulator and quality villain, arrived on the scene and tried to poke and prod at the delicate partnership, leading to the making of a main event for later in the show pitting The Queen and The Man against any two of the Damage CTRL War Games team.

This was essentially any and every show-opening promo segment designed to set up the night's main event.

This one had a little bit more substance to it, with the teases of remaining tension between Flair and Lynch, and the obviously absent Iyo Sky, Dakota Kai, Asuka, and Kairi Sane backing up The Role Model, but it was still a fairly uneventful in-ring promo to start the show that easily could have been a far shorter backstage vignette.

At least the chemistry between the characters, including Shotzi's unbridled energy in comparison to her more reserved partners, was fun.
