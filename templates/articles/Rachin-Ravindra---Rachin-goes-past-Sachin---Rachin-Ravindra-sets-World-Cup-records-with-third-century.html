Rachin Ravindra shines in dream World Cup debut, surpasses Sachin Tendulkar's record with century

NEW DELHI: New Zealand's latest batting sensation, Rachin Ravindra , continued to dazzle in his dream World Cup debut, notching up his third century of the tournament in a crucial match against Pakistan at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Saturday. The 23-year-old Rachin showcased his batting prowess by scoring 108 runs off 94 balls, featuring a six and 15 fours.With this century, Rachin made history by becoming the player with the most World Cup hundreds before turning 25, surpassing the legendary Sachin Tendulkar Tendulkar had scored two centuries in World Cup matches before his 25th birthday. Notably, Rachin was named after two Indian cricket stalwarts, Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar.In addition to this achievement, Rachin also equaled Sachin's record for the most runs (532 in 1996) in a single World Cup edition before turning 25. He now has the opportunity to break this record in his next innings.This exceptional performance marks Rachin as the record holder for the most centuries in a single ODI World Cup by a New Zealand batsman. Six New Zealand players have scored two centuries each in World Cup tournaments.During his innings, Rachin set and broke numerous records. He is now just nine runs short of England batter Jonny Bairstow 's record of 532 runs in 11 innings during the 2019 World Cup, making him a strong contender to claim the record for the most runs in his maiden World Cup edition. Thus far, Rachin has accumulated 523 runs in 8 innings.Rachin's extraordinary partnership with New Zealand's skipper, Kane Williamson , was pivotal to setting a solid platform for their team. The duo combined forces to achieve a remarkable 180-run stand for the second wicket. Williamson contributed significantly with 95 runs off 79 balls.Rachin's outstanding performances have brought him into the limelight, setting him on a path to potentially rewrite several World Cup records and solidify his place as one of cricket's most promising talents on the world stage. </textarea>
