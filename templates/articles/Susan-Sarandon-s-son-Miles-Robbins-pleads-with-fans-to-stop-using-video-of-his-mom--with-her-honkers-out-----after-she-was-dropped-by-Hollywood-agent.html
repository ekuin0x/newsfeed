                <textarea id="text" readonly> Susan Sarandon's son pleaded with fans to stop using a video of his famous mom that appears to have left him embarrassed.

Miles Robbins, 31, took to his Twitter account on Wednesday to make the request a day after the Oscar winner, 77, was dumped by her Hollywood agency UTA over her controversial Israel-Hamas war remark.

'Ok I’m really grateful to see people on Twitter defending my mom amidst a new era of McCarthyist blacklisting but can you PLEASE stop using the clip of her getting her hair done with her honkers out,' Miles wrote.

The video referenced features Susan in a sheer bra and white robe sitting in a chair while getting her hair and makeup done by a glam squad.

Miles' fans had a field day with their responses, many of which were a cheeky nod to the Susan's eye-popping clip.

Mom shame: Susan Sarandon 's son Miles Robbins begged fans to stop using a video of his famous mom that appears to have embarrassed him a bit on Tuesday; they are seen in 2012

Plea: 'Can you PLEASE stop using the clip of her getting her hair done with her honkers out,' Miles wrote on Twitter

Too much: The video referenced features Susan in a sheer bra and white robe sitting in a chair while getting her hair and makeup done by a glam squad

'Those honkers fed you have some respect,' one fan wrote, as another added, Now YOU’RE doing the blacklisting'.

And when one shared, 'You can't censor us or her big naturals, my guy,' Miles hilariously wrote back, 'I can't so this anymore'.

A spokesman for the United Talent Agency said Susan, the five-time Oscar nominee, is no longer represented by the agency.

The Dead Man Walking star's exit from UTA followed comments she’s made about Israel, most recently in an appearance Nov. 17 at a pro-Palestinian rally in New York.

'There are a lot of people afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country, so often subjected to violence,' she said.

It was also reported that Susan joined the crowd in chanting 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free' — a slogan some see as antisemitic because it suggests the eradication of Israel.

At the rally, Susan was also quoted as saying, 'There’s a terrible thing that’s happened where antisemitism has been confused with speaking up against Israel. I am against antisemitism. I am against Islamophobia.'

Susan shares sons Miles and Jack, 34, with ex-Tim Robbins and daughter Eva Amurri, 38, with Italian director, Franco Amurri.

Susan isn't the only Hollywood celeb who has been fired by their agent as Scream star Melissa Barrera was also dropped after making comments on the Israel-Hamas war that some deemed antisemitic.

Clap back: Susan shares sons Miles and Jack, 34, with ex-Tim Robbins and daughter Eva Amurri, 38, with Italian director, Franco Amurri; seen with Miles in 2017

The ex: Sarandon and Robbins split in 2009, after 23 years together; seen in 2008

Dropped: Earlier this week Sarandon was dumped by her Hollywood agency UTA over her controversial remark that frightened Jews in America facing rising antisemitism are getting a 'taste of how it feels to be Muslim'; seen in July

The Mexican-born actress, who starred in In the Heights and the two recent Scream installments, had posted statements on Instagram Stories calling the war 'genocide and ethnic cleansing.'

Gaza,' she wrote, 'is currently being treated like a concentration camp.'

Spyglass said in a statement that its position 'is unequivocally clear: We have zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech.'

Israel and Hamas on Wednesday agreed to a four-day cease-fire in the war in Gaza. </textarea>
