Bruce Willis’ daughter Scout Willis posted a sweet moment she and her father shared on Thanksgiving.

The 32-year-old daughter of Bruce and Demi Moore posted a clip via her Instagram Story Thursday of her father — who was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia earlier this year — gently holding her hand as the two sat together at the dinner table.

In the video, now making its way around X (formerly Twitter), Bruce, 68, wore a gray beanie and a matching light gray pullover for the festive day, while Scout sported a white floral top.

In another clip posted to her story, Scout rested her head in her dad’s right hand as he stood behind her.

It’s unclear if the “Fifth Element” star’s blended family spent Thanksgiving together or not, but Bruce’s wife, Emma Heming, posted a sweet group photo of the family on the holiday.

“I’m grateful and thankful to know this kind of love 🤍🧡,” she wrote via Instagram. “Wishing you all a Happy Thanksgiving 🍁🧡.”

The photo appeared to be a throwback, as Bruce’s eldest daughter, Rumer Willis, was pregnant in the group snap. (Rumer, 35, gave birth to her baby girl, Louetta, in April.)

It was revealed in October that the film star was “not totally verbal” as his disease progressed.

“My sense is the first one to three minutes he knows who I am,” friend Glenn Gordon Caron said of his visits with Bruce.

“He’s not totally verbal; he used to be a voracious reader — he didn’t want anyone to know that — and he’s not reading now. All those language skills are no longer available to him, and yet he’s still Bruce.”

Bruce’s wife and his five daughters have been open and transparent about their journey amid his health struggles.

After revealing the “Die Hard” actor’s original diagnosis of aphasia had progressed in a statement made in February, the family shared that the moments they get with him are precious.

“He is the same, which I think in this regard I’ve learned is the best thing you can ask for,” his third oldest daughter, Tallulah Willis, said on “The Drew Barrymore Show” earlier this month.

“I see love when I’m with him, and it’s my dad and he loves me, which is really special.”

The family has also shared their pain over social media, with Rumer taking to Instagram last week to post a throwback snap of her and her father with a heartwrenching caption.

“Really missing my papa,” she wrote alongside the photo.

Heming, 45, has also opened up about how family life has been amid his diagnosis, revealing that she sometimes feels “guilt” for having access to resources other families suffering from similar health struggles don’t.

“When I’m able to get out for a hike to clear my head, it’s not lost on me that not all care partners can do that,” she explained.

“When what I share about our family’s journey gets press attention, I know that there are many thousands of untold, unheard stories, each of them deserving of compassion and concern.”

Despite the guilt she felt from her family’s privilege, Heming — who shares daughters Mabel Willis, 11, and Evelyn Willis, 9, with Bruce — acknowledged the positive impact their public vulnerability has had on others.

“I see that what I share matters to others who may be struggling, and in a small way makes them feel seen and understood,” she wrote, adding, “I want people to know that when I hear from another family affected by FTD, I hear our family’s same story of grief, loss, and immense sadness echoed in theirs.” </textarea>
