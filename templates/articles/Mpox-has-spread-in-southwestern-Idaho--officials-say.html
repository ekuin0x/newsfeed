                <textarea id="text" readonly> BOISE (Idaho Capital Sun) — Mpox, a rare disease formerly known as monkeypox, has spread within Idaho, health officials announced this week.

Seven mpox infections in southwestern Idaho residents have been reported this month — the only cases reported in Idaho all year.

Six cases were reported in residents of Ada County, according to a news release on Tuesday from Central District Health. Two of those Ada County cases were first reported earlier this month. Three of the four people whose infections were reported this week did not travel recently, the release said.

A man in Canyon County also has mpox, according to a news release from Southwest District Health. Public health experts haven’t figured out how the Canyon County man contracted mpox.

Mpox — related to small pox, but milder and rarely fatal — is spread by direct contact with an infected person and possibly, but less likely, through touching things used or touched by an infected person. Infected people can spread mpox once they develop symptoms until they are fully healed, but it’s reported that some people can spread mpox before they feel symptoms.

Common mpox symptoms include a rash that could initially look like pimples or blisters, fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, muscle aches, headache and sore throat. People who suspect they might have mpox should visit a health care provider, get tested upon recommendation and avoid close contact with people, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention says.

“To reduce the likelihood of more mpox in the valley, people can cover any new bumps or sores before prolonged contact with others, use condoms during intimate activities, and get vaccinated if they haven’t already,” Central District Health Epidemiologist Sarah Wright said in a news release. “Anyone who has symptoms they think might be mpox should contact a health care provider to get tested.”

People exposed to a person who has mpox should monitor possible symptoms for 21 days and get vaccinated four to 14 days after exposure if not already vaccinated, Central District Health said in its news release.

Mpox vaccine and antiviral treatment are available.

Eighteen Idahoans have reportedly had mpox this year and last year, state data shows. More than 31,000 cases of mpox have been reported in the U.S., with 55 deaths, the CDC reports. More than 92,000 cases have been reported globally. </textarea>
