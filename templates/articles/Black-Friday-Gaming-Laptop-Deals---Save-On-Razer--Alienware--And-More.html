Looking to upgrade your gaming laptop? Now is a great time to shop, as Black Friday is offering steep discounts on a variety of products. Whether you're interested in a premium rig from Razer or Alienware, or just want something budget-friendly, gaming laptops are hitting some of their lowest prices of the year right now.

Folks looking for a very powerful and sleek laptop will first want to peruse the Razer catalog, which has several Blades on sale. All of these are equipped with top-of-the-line processors and GPUs, as well as heaps of RAM and robust SSDs. They also look as sleek as their price tag would suggest--making them a great choice for discerning gamers.

On the other side of things is the HP Victus Gaming Laptop for $450 (down from $800). Despite its low price, there's a lot of good stuff packed into the Victus, including a Ryzen 5 7535HS, RTX 2050, and 512GB SSD. It won't run the latest games very well, but if you need something for school or work that can handle light gaming, give it a close look because it offers tons of value at this new low price.

Other great deals include the Acer Predator Helios Neo for $1,050 (down from $1,580), featuring an Intel i7 13700HX and an RTX 4060, and the Gigabyte Gaming Laptop for $800 (down from $1,100) with an RTX 4060 and 16GB RAM.
