                <textarea id="text" readonly> Welcome back from the international break! Did you think this was going to be a straightforward win? Are they ever? Is Dortmund as unpredictable as they were two weeks ago? Yes! In a single half of football, we all witnessed what was arguably the worst, ugliest and most dysfunctional play from Dortmund, leaving them with a deserved two-goal deficit inside the first half-hour. But then BVB found their “ON” switch and proceeded to display arguably their best form of the season, scoring three in the next fifteen minutes to ensure they held the lead at halftime.

The second half was evenly contested and not nearly as erratic, though BVB did defend against an onslaught of late chances from the Foals, ending with a last-play finisher from Donyell Malen dribbling the ball into an empty net, after a failed corner kick from Gladbach.

Now, enough of my recap, here are our picks for Man of the Match!

Marcel Sabitzer

Marcel Sabitzer only played the first half but he made a huge impact. Not only did he successfully complete each of his passes, Marcel opened Dortmund’s scoring in a pivotal stage of the game. The goal shell-shocked Monchengladbach and ignited the home crowd which was crucial in shifting this game’s momentum.

Jamie Bynoe-Gittens

Though the teenager has been inconsistent in his handful of appearances, he was on fire today. The Englishman’s footwork is incredible at times and he found space to record six shots. Not only did JBG assist Füllkrug’s equalizing goal, he also scored his own just before halftime, giving BVB an important lead at the break.

Niclas Füllkrug

Like JBG, Niclas found the net while assisting another goal. In fact, it was Füllkrug who assisted JBG’s goal. The English starlet and the German veteran weren't the attacking partnership I was anticipating at the season’s start, but I like it... I like it a lot. If he can keep improving, then JBG will grow into a world-class talent; he certainly showed the potential today.

Emre Can

It was good to have our captain back and fit to start a match. He won all but one of his tackles and all but one of his ground-duals, displaying his importance in holding the midfield and controlling possession. When Emre Can subbed out, Dortmund lost their ability to maintain possession, leading to a very nervy conclusion.
