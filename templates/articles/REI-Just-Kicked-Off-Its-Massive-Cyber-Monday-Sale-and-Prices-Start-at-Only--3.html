Best REI Cyber Monday Deals

Gsi Outdoors Halulite 1-Quart Tea Kettle

REI

This cute tea kettle is a camping cookware essential. Not only will it help you heat water up for coffee and tea, but it can also be a lifeline in terms of cooking food. Use it to rehydrate ramen, cook oats, and make any camping meal with ease. It holds 32-fluid ounces and is made with an aluminum core to give it even, heat-holding capabilities. The handle swings down for more compact storage, and is lightweight at just 5.8 ounces.

Gsi 23-Piece Outdoors Pinnacle Camper Cookset

REI

Also on sale from Gsi is this massive cookware set. This is for folks that plan to stick around on a campsite or a camping trip for a while. It comes with almost everything you need (aside from the food and the stove). Use the 2 or 3 liter pots to heat or cook food (both come with lids) and the skillet to make breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It comes with four plates, four bowls, and four insulated mugs with sip lids for easy eating and drinking. Included is a pot gripper and a storage sack to complete the set.

BioLite FirePit Griddle

REI

This griddle is meant to go over the BioLite fire pit, which is also on sale right now, though shoppers note they use this piece of cookware over any heat source it suits, since it's made with pure cast iron. It’s a long cooking surface at 19.3 inches, and it comes with roughly 2-inch walls that’ll keep whatever you’re cooking contained. Use it for pancakes, eggs, steaks, vegetables, stir-fry, and any other dishes you can dream up.

Humangear GoBites Uno Spork

REI

This $3 tool, though simple, is a total must-have. It’s a dual-ended fork and spoon, that way you can eat your oats, chilis, soups and stews with ease with the spoon, and use the fork to munch on fruit, salads, and more. It’s designed to lay flat, so it’ll stay secure wherever you place it.

Mpowered 18-Inch Luci Solar String Lights

REI

These string lights add a level of ambiance to your campsite. They are easily portable with a round case, and the lights themselves are shatterproof and weather-resistant. They’re solar powered, though you could also use a charge port to power them up. The lights have multiple settings to choose from, and can last 20 hours on a single charge, according to the brand.

Gsi Outdoors 7-Piece Santoku Knife Set

REI

You can’t cook without a proper knife set, and this $32 pick from Gsi outdoors has nearly everything you need. It comes with a 4-inch paring knife that’s perfect for hulling and peeling and trimming, a 6-inch chef’s knife for dicing and mincing, and a 6-inch santoku knife for chopping and slicing. It also comes with sheaths to keep the blades covered, a folding cutting board, a soap bottle, a dishcloth, and a case to keep everything neatly packed.

AeroPress XL Coffee Press

REI

We love the AeroPress — it’s our favorite way to make pour-over coffee on the go, so it’s ideal for folks that don’t want to skip their coffee while they’re on a trip. This XL version is especially helpful, since you can make two cups of coffee at once. Not only can you make coffee in it, but also espresso, latte, and cold brew. It’s easy and fast to use, and all you need is a bit of hot water and coffee grounds to make an exceptionally smooth, flavorful cup.

Helinox Chair Zero

REI

You can’t go on a camping trip without somewhere to sit, especially if you plan to eat and hang out a bit. This Helinox chair is on sale just in time for you to pick up one or two (or more). Its biggest perk is how lightweight and compact it is — a single chair is just a pound, and folds into the size of a 32-ounce water bottle. It still offers comfort, with a sturdy polyester body and an aluminum frame. Score it in white, gray, or black on sale today.

REI Co-op Traverse 32 Pack

REI

This 32-liter backpack from REI (also on sale in the men’s size) is a powerhouse. It comes in three different sizes, ranging from extra small to medium, and it comes with a variety of zip entries and buckles for secure organization, plus a fully constructed design with comfort and security in mind as you walk. It also has an easy-access rain over for when you experience any sudden showers along the way.

Rumpl Original Puffy Recycled Blanket

REI

A blanket is a must for lounging, lining the tent, or dining outside. No matter what size you choose, these Rumpl blankets are the perfect choice. They have the same insulated fibers as puffy jackets do to keep you warm or add a bit of cushion to sit on. They’re made from recycled polyester and are totally machine washable for easy cleanup once you’re back home.
