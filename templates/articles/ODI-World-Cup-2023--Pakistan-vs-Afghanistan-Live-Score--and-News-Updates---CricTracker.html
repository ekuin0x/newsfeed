                <textarea id="text" readonly> The action will continue in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 as Pakistan and Afghanistan take on each other in Match 22 on Monday, October 23 at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai. Pakistan are coming into the game having lost back-to-back fixtures against India and Australia. They started their tournament well with wins over the Netherlands and Sri Lanka but lost their way after the first two matches.

The Babar Azam-led side are ranked on the fifth spot on the points table with four points from four matches. On the other hand, Afghanistan are coming into the game having lost their previous fixture against New Zealand by 149 runs. They began their tournament with back-to-back losses against Bangladesh and India. However, the Hashmatullah Shahidi-led side gave a surprising defeat to the defending champions by 69 runs in their third game.

Afghanistan find themselves on the last spot (tenth) on the points table with one win from three matches having two points to their name. The upcoming fixture promises to be an enthralling contest as the two sides will look to get back to winning ways after losing their last fixtures.

Notably, the two teams had a close affair, the last time they met in the ODI World Cup in 2019. Afghanistan made tough work of Pakistan’s chase of 228 as they could only win the game in the last over by three wickets with two balls to spare.

Afghanistan Spinners to enjoy their outing in Chennai

Meanwhile, the surface in Chennai has been favourable for spinners historically. In the last five matches played at the venue, three have been won by teams batting second. The average first innings score in the same time period has been 257 while the highest target chased is 288. Captain winning the toss is likely to bowl first as two out of the three matches played at the venue in the tournament so far have been won by teams batting second.

Afghanistan’s spin-trio of Rashid Khan, Mujeeb ur Rahman and Mohammad Nabi will enjoy their outing in the middle and will look to pile on the pressure on Pakistan. </textarea>
