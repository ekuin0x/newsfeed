Scott Disick scored a coveted invite to the Kardashian's Thanksgiving dinner in Palm Springs.

Not only did the reality star, 40, and his kids Mason, 13, Penelope, 11, and Reign, eight, get to dine with his ex-girlfriend Kourtney Kardashian's family - he also got to jet back to Los Angeles on one of their private jets.

On Saturday, the Flip it Like Disick alum was spotted getting off the private plane with Kris Jenner, 68, Kendall Jenner, 28, Kylie Jenner, 26, and her son Aire, one, who was being carried by a nanny.

Notably missing from the 30-minute flight and Thanksgiving dinner in the desert oasis was Kourtney, 44, and her husband Travis Barker, 48.

The new parents of baby Rocky Thirteen opted to stay home with their newborn this year.

And everyone got along just fine as Kris was spotted hugging Scott after they got off the plane and went their separate ways.

Scott was dressed comfortably in a pair of baggy sweatpants and a black t-shirt.

Meanwhile, Kourtney celebrated with Travis, Rocky and Travis' kids Landon Barker, 20, and Alabama Barker, 17.

He shares Landon and Alabama with his ex-wife Shanna Moakler, 48.

Both the Poosh founder and Alabama shared Instagram Stories giving fans a glimpse into their Thanksgiving celebration.

Reportedly, Kourtney had rules for who was allowed to attend her Thanksgiving and even come over to her house.

Kourtney will only allow family and friends over by invitation only.

Kim and Kris haven't even met Rocky yet, according to a source for the U.S. Sun.

'Kourtney is going to be introducing the new baby to her family on an "invite-only" basis,' the source revealed.

'Kourtney and Travis have communicated that they will be taking "family only" time for the newly blended family and for Kourt to rest, and then they will be inviting the extended family over on an individual basis,' the insider explained.

The source continued: 'So now everyone's talking about where Kim will be on the list. Obviously, Kris will be first - but who is going to get the second invite?

'Kourtney has said it's a germs thing - to protect the baby and not expose him to any risk - but it's, like, part of her new strategy to keep everyone at arm's length,' the source claimed. </textarea>
