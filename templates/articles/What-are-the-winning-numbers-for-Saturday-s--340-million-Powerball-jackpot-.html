How to play Powerball

Powerball costs $2 per ticket, and is available in every US state except Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah. You can also take part in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

To play, you must choose five numbers between 1 and 69, and an additional ‘Powerball’ number between 1 and 26. To secure the jackpot, all six of your selected numbers must match those that are drawn. The top prize grows after each draw until it is won.

Jackpot winners can choose to receive their money in 30 installments over 29 years (the annuity option), or as a lump sum (the cash option). If you opt to be paid up front, you get a lower amount, which is approximately half of the original jackpot. Winnings are pre-tax amounts.

Smaller prizes are also available if you correctly guess some, but not all, of the winning numbers.

All Powerball prizes (odds in brackets) Five numbers + Powerball: Jackpot (1 in 292,201,338)

(1 in 292,201,338) Five numbers: $1 million (1 in 11,688,053.52)

(1 in 11,688,053.52) Four numbers + Powerball: $50,000 (1 in 913,129.18)

(1 in 913,129.18) Four numbers: $100 (1 in 36,525.17)

(1 in 36,525.17) Three numbers + Powerball: $100 (1 in 14,494.11)

(1 in 14,494.11) Three numbers: $7 (1 in 579.76)

(1 in 579.76) Two numbers + Powerball: $7 (1 in 701.33)

(1 in 701.33) One number + Powerball $4 (1 in 91.98)

(1 in 91.98) Powerball: $4 (1 in 38.32)

When are Powerball draws?

There are three Powerball draws a week, held at 10:59 p.m. ET / 7:59 p.m. PT on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.

Power Play and Double Play

If players pay $1 extra for Power Play, their winnings will be multiplied by two, three, four, five or ten, depending on the multiplier number picked out of the hat before the draw takes place. Power Play isn’t applied to the jackpot, and the multiplier is never higher than two if you win the $1 million second prize.

For an additional $1, players in certain areas of the US can also be entered into a second draw, known as Double Play, with a maximum jackpot of $10 million. </textarea>
