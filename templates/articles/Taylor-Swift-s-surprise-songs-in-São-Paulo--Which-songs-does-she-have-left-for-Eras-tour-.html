                <textarea id="text" readonly> The surprise songs for Taylor Swift's first night in São Paulo were "Now That We Don't Talk" from "1989 (Taylor's Version) [From the Vault]" on the guitar and "Innocent" from "Speak Now (Taylor's Version)" on the piano.

At the top of the concert, Swift praised the sold-out crowd inside the Allianz Parque stadium.

"You went ahead and broke the attendance record for this stadium," she said for her inaugural show in the city. "Which means there has never been this many people in this room before. Thank you São Paulo."
