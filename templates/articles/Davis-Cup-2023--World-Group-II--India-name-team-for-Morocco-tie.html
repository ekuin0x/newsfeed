                <textarea id="text" readonly> The All India Tennis Association (AITA), on Monday, named a six-member Indian tennis team for the Davis Cup 2023 World Group II tie against Morocco, scheduled from September 16 to 17 in Lucknow.

Veteran doubles ace Rohan Bopanna and Sumit Nagal, India’s top men’s singles player in the ATP tennis rankings at world No. 179, will headline India’s team.

Rohan Bopanna, world No. 9 in doubles, has been in great form this year, winning the Qatar Open and Indian Wells Masters. The veteran Indian tennis player announced last month that the Morocco tie will be his career’s final Davis Cup appearance.

Sumit Nagal, who endured a difficult time in the last couple of years with injury, has also shot up the rankings after winning ATP Challenger titles in Rome and Tampere this season.

Sasikumar Mukund (world No. 345), Digvijay Pratap Singh (world No. 535), Yuki Bhambri (world No. 944) and Ramkumar Ramanathan (world No. 573) are the other four Indian tennis players in the squad against Morocco.

Former player Rohit Rajpal will continue as the non-playing captain of the Indian Davis Cup team while Zeeshan Ali will be the coach.

The Indian tennis team lost 3-2 to Denmark in the Davis Cup 2023 World Group I play-offs in February to drop down to Group II stage for the first time since the new Davis Cup format was implemented in 2019.

There is only one change in the Indian Davis Cup team from the squad that was named versus Denmark. Digvijay Pratap Singh replaces Prajnesh Gunneswaran.

In addition, the AITA has also named five more players - Saketh Myneni, Manas Dhamne, Manish Sureshkumar, Karan Singh and Yuvan Nandal - who will be with the squad to provide the core group with some valuable practice matches.

A total of 24 national teams will compete in World Group II ties. The 12 winners will progress to World Group I playoffs while the losers will drop to World Group II playoffs.

A Davis Cup tie comprises five matches - four singles and one doubles. The team which wins at least three of these matches will win the tie.

The Indian tennis team’s best performances at the Davis Cup came in 1966, 1974 and 1987, when they finished as the runners-up.
