                <textarea id="text" readonly> Defending champions Manchester City take on Liverpool in a top of the table clash of the Premier League at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday. Liverpool trail City by a solitary point in the Premier League table and head into this fixture hoping to prove they are once again genuine title contenders. However, Jurgen Klopp's men have won only two of their six away league games so far and face the ultimate challenge at the Etihad. City have won 23 matches in a row at home in all competitions dating back to December last year.

Dominant City have won the title in five of the past six seasons, with Liverpool the only team to break that run in 2020.

Since Pep Guardiola's arrival as City boss in 2016, the two sides have played 14 league matches, with City winning five and Liverpool triumphing four times.
