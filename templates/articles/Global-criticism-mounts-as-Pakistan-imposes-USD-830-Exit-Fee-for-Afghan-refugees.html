                <textarea id="text" readonly> Several Western diplomats and the United Nations have strongly criticized Pakistan for its recent decision to impose substantial exit fees, amounting to hundreds of dollars, on every Afghan refugee escaping persecution by the Taliban. The move has been widely condemned as "shocking and frustrating," according to The Guardian's report.

In an "unprecedented" measure, Pakistan has implemented a new policy specifically aimed at refugees awaiting departure to Western nations through resettlement programs. The policy imposes charges of approximately USD 830 per person. This development follows Pakistan's recent announcement of a crackdown on undocumented foreigners, establishing November 1 as the deadline for approximately 2 million unregistered Afghans to exit the country. Subsequently, mass deportations of undocumented Afghans commenced as the specified deadline lapsed.

Since the fall of Kabul in August 2021, thousands of Afghans lacking proper documentation or with expired visas have remained in Pakistan, anticipating a fresh start in Western countries. The majority of these individuals, who had previous employment with Western governments and organizations, are deemed eligible for resettlement on humanitarian grounds, as reported by The Guardian.

Following the fall of Kabul in August 2021, numerous Afghans without adequate documentation or possessing expired visas have stayed in Pakistan, hopeful for a new beginning in Western nations. According to The Guardian's report, the majority of these individuals, who previously worked with Western governments and organizations, are considered eligible for humanitarian-based resettlement.

“I know it is very tough economically for Pakistan but really, to try to make money off refugees is really unattractive,” The Guardian quoted a diplomat as saying.

“The issue has also been raised by the two UN agencies in the lead on this mess, the [UN refugee agency] UNHCR and [International Organization of Migration] IOM,” the diplomat added. “It has also been raised in capitals and headquarters. I suspect everyone has also passed the message to their (Pakistan contacts).”

Another diplomat revealed that Western officials were informed of the decision during a briefing conducted by the interior and foreign ministries. When concerns were expressed about the fee, officials clarified that the initial proposal had been to charge USD 10,000 per person, but it was subsequently reduced to USD 830.

“It is very bizarre and I personally find it very frustrating. If Pakistan wants to facilitate the process of the settlement of refugees in the West then they should not make it more complicated with such absurd conditions,” the diplomat said. “What is the justification for this exit permit fee? To make a lot of money?”

Afghan refugees are required to pay the exit permit fee using a credit card, a payment method inaccessible to many of them. “This makes it worse as it should be paid by refugees and most of them don’t have credit cards. I think we need a cooperative approach of working together to help the refugees and we expect Pakistan would help,” another diplomat said.

Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, the spokesperson for Pakistan's foreign ministry, stated that there are no intentions to alter the policy. “These individuals have been here for the last two years and they are not refugees but immigrants with overstay in their visas and lack of documents. But we expect the concerned countries would expedite the visa and approval process so that they can leave for their destination as early as possible,” The Guardian quoted her as saying.

Pakistan's foreign ministry, represented by Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, insists on detailed information for refugee resettlement, while a Western diplomat cites legal constraints. UNHCR, through spokesperson Babar Baloch, collaborates with Pakistan, urging exemptions from exit fines and visa fees for resettling refugees.

The UN acknowledges potential anxiety among Afghan refugees in Pakistan awaiting resettlement. Concerns over transparency and the risks faced by returnees, particularly in harsh winter conditions, have been raised by experts and aid organizations, as reported by Khaama Press. Over 320,000 Afghans have entered through the Spinboldak and Turkham border crossings since November 1.
