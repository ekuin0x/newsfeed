                <textarea id="text" readonly> The hunt for a second Davis Cup Juniors title is still on for Team Canada.

After finishing 2-1 in the group stage, Canada will advance to the quarter-finals where they’ll take on Spain in hopes of keeping their dream alive.

Throughout the week, Team Canada played the United States, Japan, and Thailand.

The week started with a tough loss to the USA as none of the players managed to edge out a win against our neighbours to the south.

Nicolas Arsenault lost his match to Darwin Blanch in straight sets 6-1, 6-4. His brother Mikael Arsenault lost to Maxwell Exsted with a score of 7-5, 6-0. The final match was a doubles showdown between Mikael Arsenault and Adam Farag Cao though the two lost 6-2, 6-1.

Fortunately for Team Canada, they didn’t lose another match against neither of Japan nor Thailand.

The country made quick work of Japan, besting them in each of the three matches as Canada evened the tides.

Japan, in turn, lost to the USA, but beat Thailand in all three matches as well. With these results, Canada needed a big series of wins against Thailand to send them to the quarter-finals.

And deliver they did.

In the first two singles matches, Farag Cao and Arsenault did not struggle against their opponents, winning 6-2, 6-1 and 6-1, 6-2 respectively. Though Thailand put up a fight in the doubles finale against the Arsenault brothers, it wasn’t enough to keep Canada from pushing through to the quarter-finals.

With the group stage behind them, Team Canada will have their sights set on defeating Spain next. In their group, Spain won against Italy and Kazakhstan, but fell to Korea.

Canada and Spain will play tomorrow, Nov. 3 following a rest day. </textarea>
