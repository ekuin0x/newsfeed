                <textarea id="text" readonly> A massive metal sphere caused Japanese officials to close a beach on Tuesday and launch an investigation amid security suspicions.

The mysterious iron ball - 1.5 meters in diameter - was found by a woman at Enshuhama beach, in the city of Hamamatsu.

The local called Police at around 9am which prompted the closing of the beach, according to Asahi news.

A video posted to Twitter shows Japanese officials slowly approaching the suspicious object while wearing protective uniforms.

A 200 mete area was cornered off from fears of explosion, along the coast 250km from capital Tokyo.

Police confirmed that the object is a sphere believed to be made from iron, due to the coating of rust on it's surface.

While Vice News noted that the object resembled a mooring buoy, due to the protrusion which could allow it to hook onto something.

Japanese bomb crews had the ball X-rayed and determined that it did not pose any danger to locals.

However, the bizarre find sparked a flurry of both local and international media attention.

Security fears were heightened in the wake of the US shooting down a Chinse spy balloon earlier this month and multiple subsequent unidentified objects spotted globally.

Japanese Police will reportedly have the item removed by local officials responsible for coastal management in Hamamatsu city. </textarea>
