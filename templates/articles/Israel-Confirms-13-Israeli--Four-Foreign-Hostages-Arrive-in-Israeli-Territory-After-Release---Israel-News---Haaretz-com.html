                <textarea id="text" readonly> The release of the second tranche of Israeli hostages, according to the Israel-Hamas cease-fire deal, was delayed by Hamas who claimed Israel was not standing by its obligations on aid to Gaza. A Qatari delegation visited Israel on Saturday “to ensure that the deal continues to progress smoothly." Egypt said on Saturday it had received positive signals from all parties about extending the truce for one or two days.

Here’s what you need to know 50 days into the war.

■ 13 further Israeli hostages are set to be freed Saturday from Hamas captivity. U.S. President Joe Biden said he expects American citizens to be released in the ongoing hostage deal.

■ Early Saturday evening, Hamas delayed the second hostage release, claiming Israel had not fulfilled its obligation to allow aid trucks to reach northern Gaza.

■ Israeli security sources said it's unclear why Hamas is delaying the release, adding that Hamas head "Sinwar is embarrassing himself in front of the international community."

■ Most of the hostages set to be released were taken captive from Kibbutz Be'eri. Despite Israel's request to add another hostage to the list, Hamas claimed it couldn't comply.

■ Israel is set to release 42 Palestinian prisoners as part of the hostage exchange agreement on Saturday.

■ The Israel-Hamas cease-fire went into effect on Friday at 7 A.M. local time. 13 Israeli and 11 foreign national hostages were released by Hamas on Friday evening. Israel said 200 humanitarian aid trucks entered Gaza. Israel released 39 Palestinian prisoners on Friday: 17 minors and 22 women.

■ The cease-fire is set to last for four days, during which 50 Israeli hostages in total are expected to be released in four consecutive groups as well as 150 Palestinian prisoners.

■ Egypt said on Saturday it had received positive signals from all parties about possibly extending the truce for one or two days.

■ The IDF will cease aerial activity over southern Gaza, and limit activity in the north. Hamas will use the pause in fighting to locate other hostages taken captive from Israel.

■ The four younger women and four children released from Hamas on Friday are in good medical condition, say doctors who examined them. The five elderly women freed are being treated at Holon’s Wolfson Medical Center and are reported to be in a stable condition.

■ Four of the 10 Thai citizens released Friday had not been officially listed as abducted, Thailand's Foreign Ministry announced.

■ Hamas claims to have located an additional 10–20 hostages that it can release in exchange for further days of cease-fire.

■ A Qatari delegation arrived in Israel on Saturday “to coordinate between the parties in the field and their counterparts in Doha to ensure that the deal continues to progress smoothly," according to a Qatari official.

■ IDF Chief of Staff Herzl Halevi stated that following the ceasefire, the IDF will resume military operations in Gaza with the aim of dismantling Hamas.

■ Thousands of Israelis are attending a rally in Tel Aviv’s ‘Hostages Square’ marking 50 days since Hamas’ October 7 massacres and its abduction of some 240 people to Gaza.

■ Israel will be German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier's first stop on a Middle East trip starting Sunday which will also include Oman and Qatar.

■ In the last 24 hours, the IDF said it shot down a surface-to-air missile launched from Lebanon and intercepted a "suspicious target" crossing the border, and attacked Hezbollah infrastructure in response.■ The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said that one of its patrols was hit by Israeli gunfire in southern Lebanon, adding there were no casualties.

■ An Israeli-owned cargo ship was attacked by a suspected Iranian drone in the northern Indian Ocean overnight into Friday, according to a U.S. defense official.

■ On Saturday, Israel shot down two aerial objects heading towards Eilat, similar to previous launches by Yemen's Houthis against Israel.

■ A 25-year-old Palestinian man was shot and killed by IDF forces conducting arrests near Jenin in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.

■ Members of Hamas and Fatah in the West Bank have killed two residents of Tul Karm accused of collaborating with Israeli intelligence, according to Palestinian reports. </textarea>
