                <textarea id="text" readonly> The relationship between the decision makers at Borussia Dortmund seems to be hugely tense at the moment, with disagreements and disharmony in many places.

A lot has been said and written about the internal division within the Borussia Dortmund camp that had a big effect on the club’s transfer business this past summer. There is an in-depth report in the latest SportBILD issue about the relationship between BVB CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke, sporting director Sebastian Kehl, and head coach Edin Terzic.

According to the magazine, the trio have differing opinions on a variety of issues and struggle to see eye to eye on matters far too often.

The relationship between Kehl and Terzic is said to be one of convenience rather than trust, with the friction stemming from Borussia Dortmund’s haphazard approach in the summer transfer window. Accusations also seem to exist regarding some of the club’s recent signings behind closed doors.

Furthermore, the magazine claims that the relationship between sporting coordinator Slaven Stanic and the BVB bosses is also very strained. There are even claims circling within the club that Stanic, who joined BVB earlier this year, is campaigning against Terzic.

Watzke remains the top decision maker at Borussia Dortmund, and is the biggest backer of Terzic at the club. He stated before the start of the season that Terzic will be the BVB head coach for years to come. And the report adds that he also wants Kehl to give more of a backing to the 41 year old.

Despite the tense relationship between those in charge, the hope remains that the team can turn things around and achieve the desired level of success on the pitch. Whether that can actually happen remains to be seen. </textarea>
