                <textarea id="text" readonly> NEW YORK – Video footage from several news organizations showed demonstrators blocking the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York to protest the treatment of Palestinians by Israel in the ongoing war.

Local news outlets Fox 5 and Newsday, as well as online news site FreedomNews.TV, published videos appearing to show protesters, donning white jumpsuits, crossing spectator barricades in front of the ongoing parade. The incident appeared to take place Thursday morning.

Footage appeared to show the demonstration on Sixth Avenue through Midtown Manhattan along the parade route. The protesters carried a banner that read "Liberation for Palestine and Planet," videos showed.

Their jumpsuits included words such as "Capitalism," "Colonialism" and "Racism."

The climate advocate coalition Seven Circles Alliance has claimed responsibility for the demonstration, to protest what they called "the ongoing ethnic cleansing and genocide of Palestinians," according to an Instagram post. The group could not immediately be reached for comment.

Some demonstrators appeared to glue themselves to the Sixth Avenue pavement. Demonstrators then poured a reddish liquid over each other, seemingly to mimic blood. Police officers were seen trying to remove the protesters from the street and handcuffing them as parade marchers continued past them.

The New York City Police Department said it is confirming the total number of people arrested. Macy’s did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.

In another show, a person on the float for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe had a Palestinian flag raised, though, in a statement, the tribe said it takes no stance on the conflict overseas. "While we cannot speak for an individual's actions, his actions were not a Tribal decision," the tribe's post said.

The NYPD confirmed one person was also taken into custody for pro-Palestinian graffiti and red paint spattered outside of the New York Public Library's main branch, the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, during a march on Thursday through Midtown. Schwarzman, the CEO of the private equity firm Blackstone, is considered a staunch Israel supporter. </textarea>
