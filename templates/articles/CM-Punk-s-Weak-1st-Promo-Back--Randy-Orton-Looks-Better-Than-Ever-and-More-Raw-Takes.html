Seth Rollins is the world heavyweight champion and has a ton of responsibilities to fill. He will defend his gold against Jey Uso next week, and Drew McIntyre is still looking for a rematch.



However, the money match is Rollins vs. CM Punk. It is the contest everyone wants to see, and the best way to reintroduce The Best in the World in WWE.

Rollins showed his value during his rivalry with Cody Rhodes, but there is real heat between The Visionary and Punk. This is a story that can elevate both men if done right. But it should not be delayed.



Rollins has never minced his words about Punk. In an interview with Nick Hausman of Wrestling Inc, he called the former AEW star a "cancer" before Royal Rumble 2023. Even when The Best in the World was working on WWE Backstage in 2019, the two exchanged jabs.



While that heat touches on reality, it has clearly been heightened to set up a story for the future. With all the work put into this, it has the potential to be the hottest angle on Raw.



Nothing else is going to stand in comparison for Punk's return feud. </textarea>
