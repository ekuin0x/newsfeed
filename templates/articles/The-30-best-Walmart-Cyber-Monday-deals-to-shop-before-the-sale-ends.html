And the much-loved memory foam in the Tempur-Pedic Cloud Pillow does just that. It's supportive where you need it to be, adapting to your specific head, neck and shoulders — yet also retains its shape easily. And the extra-soft feel means no more counting sheep. It's now down to under $50 a pop! One reviewer's grandchildren even asked for these pillows. When do kids ask for pillows?
