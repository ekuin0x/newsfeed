                <textarea id="text" readonly> Black Friday is here, which means it's the best time of year to stock up on that smart home gear you’ve had your eye on. As usual, there are some deep discounts to be found on smart speakers and smart displays, as well as robot vacuums that you can control with a command to that smart speaker and video doorbells whose live feed you can see through one of those smart displays.

There are also some excellent bargains on smart door locks, smart lights, and smart plugs, including some of the first discounts we’re seeing on Matter-compatible devices. So read on for my pick of the bargains on the best smart home gear out there.

Best deals on smart speakers and smart displays

The brand new, very good Echo Show 8 (third-gen) smart display is just $104.99 at Amazon, down from $149.99. Featuring a Thread radio, Zigbee hub, and Matter Controller capabilities, this is a great smart home hub and an excellent smart display. Read my review.

The best Echo smart speaker, Amazon’s fourth-gen Echo is down to $54.99 from $99.99 at Amazon. With great sound, a sassy spherical look, and a Thread radio and Zigbee hub on board, this Alexa speaker packs a lot of power for a low price.

The fifth-gen Echo Dot for just $23 at Amazon is a spectacular deal for this great smart speaker. Pair two for stereo, and be very surprised you only spent $50 for room-filling sound (okay, a small room). The fact that each one also comes with a TP-Link Kasa color smart bulb is just gravy.
