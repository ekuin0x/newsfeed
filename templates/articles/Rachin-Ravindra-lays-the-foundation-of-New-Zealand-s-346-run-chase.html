                <textarea id="text" readonly> In pursuit of 346, New Zealand were given a solid start by Rachin Ravindra at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad. The left-handed youngster scored 97 off 72 balls while Kane Williamson retird hurt after compiling a fifty on return.

Williamson is set to miss New Zealand’s opening game of the World Cup against England on October 5, as he continues his injury rehabilitation. He will bat but refrain from fielding in the first warm-up game as his workload needs to be managed.

The Kiwi lynchpin resumed batting practice in the first week of August by facing throwdowns in the nets, thus reigniting the possibility of him playing a part in the upcoming ODI World Cup in India. Williamson’s chances appeared slim when he ruptured his ACL in Gujarat Titans’ IPL campaign opener on March 31, 2023. On Tuesday, Williamson posted a clip on Instagram with a caption “Nice to be back in the nets with the bat in hand for a few throws.”

Williamson picked up the serious injury during the 13th over of the first innings of the tournament opener, when he landed hard on his right knee after attempting a catch at the deep square leg fence. While he did manage to intercept the six, palming the ball which then trickled towards the advertising cushions, Williamson clutched his knee in agony upon the fall and was helped off the ground. Incidentally. the former New Zealand captain had only just recovered from an elbow injury which had troubled him for the past couple of years. </textarea>
