                <textarea id="text" readonly> Alabama has five commitments among AL.com’s revamped A-List of the top 15 senior recruits in the state of Alabama.

Iron Bowl rival Auburn has three, all among the top seven in the state.

Each summer, AL.com ranks the top 15 seniors in the state and then adjusts the order based on performance several times throughout the fall.

RELATED: Week 1 playoff schedule

The following is the pre-playoff list. The final A-List will be released in January. Four players who weren’t among the top 15 this summer made the playoff list.

Auburn linebacker commit Demarcus Riddick was No. 1 in the summer. Did the Chilton County star keep his spot at the top?

Here is the revamped A-List heading into Round 1 of the playoffs.

St. James quarterback KJ Jackson looks to hand off to St. James' Cosner Harrison during the AHSAA Super 7 Class 3A championship at Jordan-Hare Stadium in Auburn, Ala., Thursday, Dec. 1, 2022. (Mark Almond | preps@al.com)

15. KJ Jackson, QB, St. James

Height/weight: 6-3, 215

Preseason A-List rank: Not ranked

Senior stats: Jackson has thrown for 1,750 yards this season, with nine touchdowns and only two interceptions while leading St. James on another run toward the Super 7.

Recruiting update: Committed to Arkansas

Randy Kennedy analysis: KJ Jackson could be the SEC’s next great left-handed quarterback. He has the perfect combination for a modern-day quarterback – he is a capable runner, but his best production comes from inside the pocket.

Next game: vs. Opp, Round 1, Class 3A playoffs, tonight

14. JacQawn McRoy, OL, Clay-Chalkville

Height/weight: 6-8, 365

Preseason A-List rank: Not ranked

Senior stats: Has helped pave the way for the Cougars’ unbeaten regular season. Also caught a 2-point conversion in a win over four-time reigning 7A champ Thompson.

Recruiting update: Committed to Oregon

Randy Kennedy analysis: Watching JacQawn McRoy catch a pass for a 2-point conversion against Thompson was one of the highlights of the 2023 season. Even big guys marvel at how big and nimble McRoy is.

Next game: vs. Cullman, Round 1, Class 6A playoffs, Friday

13. Jared Hollins, QB, Mary G. Montgomery

Height/weight: 6-4, 185

Preseason A-List rank: Not ranked

Senior stats: Entering Round 1, Hollins has completed 135-of-192 pass attempts for 2,395 yards and 29 TDs. He’s been intercepted just once. He’s also rushed 50 times for 384 yards and 8 TDs.

Recruiting update: Committed to South Alabama

Randy Kennedy analysis: Jared Hollins is a leader who directed MGM to its first undefeated regular season in almost 60 years. Comparing anyone to Patrick Mahomes is unfair, but Hollins has some of the same traits, whether he’s in the pocket or making magic with off-platform throws.

Next game: vs. Dothan, Round 1, Class 7A playoffs, Friday

Spanish Fort defensive lineman Cole McConathy readies for a play against St. Michael in a jamboree football game Thursday, August 17, 2023, in Spanish Fort, Ala. (Mike Kittrell | preps@al.com)

12. Cole McConathy, DE, Spanish Fort

Height/weight: 6-5, 225

Preseason A-List rank: Not ranked

Senior stats: McConathy has 92 tackles, including 25.5 tackles for loss. He also has 16 sacks for a loss of 77 yards and 34 QB hurries. He has blocked three field goals.

Recruiting update: Committed to Louisville

Randy Kennedy analysis: He’s not a tight end, as some recruiting him want to say he is. He’s not a late bloomer or an overachiever. Cole McConathy is simply one of the best football players and prospects in the state. When he’s playing in the NFL, a lot of fans are going to be wondering why he didn’t play his college football in the SEC, specifically at Alabama or Auburn.

Next game: vs. Bessemer City, Round 1, Class 6A playoffs, Friday

Tuscaloosa County's Kevin Riley carries the ball against Hewitt-Trussville in Trussville, Ala., Friday, Sept. 15, 2023. (Mark Almond | preps@al.com)

11. Kevin Riley, RB, Tuscaloosa County

Height/weight: 5-11, 195

Preseason A-List rank: 12

Senior stats: Riley rushed for 764 yards and 7 TDs on 124 carries and caught 8 passes for 145 yards and a TD. He missed 2.5 games.

Recruiting update: Committed to Miami

Randy Kennedy analysis: Kevin Riley is the prototypical modern back who is as comfortable as a pass catcher as he is running the ball.

Next game: Season over

10. William Sanders, OL, Brookwood

Height/weight: 6-3, 290

Preseason A-List rank: 10

Senior stats: Dominant 4-star offensive lineman.

Recruiting update: Committed to Alabama

Randy Kennedy analysis: Williams Sanders is smart and incredibly athletic. It’s easy to see him as an effective leader and pulling guard at Alabama.

Next game: Season over

Vestavia Jordan Ross lines up for a play against Helena during the first half of a football game, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2023, in Birmingham, Ala. (Butch Dill/ preps@al.com) preps@al.com

Senior stats: Ross has been credited with 55 tackles, 20 tackles for a loss, 11 sacks and 9 QB hurries. He also has 6 pass deflections and a blocked field goal.

Recruiting update: Committed to Tennessee

Randy Kennedy analysis: Everyone is looking for prospects like Jordan Ross, who looks like a basketball forward but has the mentally of a pass-rusher off the edge.

Next game: at Austin, Round 1, Class 7A playoffs, Friday

Central - Phenix City defensive tackle Isaia Faga (88) defends during the second half of a game against Dothan Friday, Oct. 6, 2023 in Phenix City Ala. (AL.com Photo/Stew Milne)Stew Milne

8. Isaia Faga, DL, Central-Phenix City

Height/weight: 6-2, 275

Preseason A-List rank: 6

Senior stats: Faga has 40 tackles, 14.5 tackles for loss, 5 sacks and 7 QB hurries for Patrick Nix’s team.

Recruiting update: Committed to Alabama

Randy Kennedy analysis: It’s hard to find a playmaker who is also comfortable with all the responsibilities of a true noseguard. That’s what makes Isaia Faga such a special prospect.

Next game: vs. Davidson, Round 1, Class 7A playoffs, Friday

Chilton County's Demarcus Riddick eyes Helena's Joseph Roberto during a game at Husky Stadium in Helena, Ala., on Friday, Sept. 15, 2023. (Dennis Victory | preps@al.com)

7. Demarcus Riddick, LB, Chilton County

Height/weight: 6-2, 212

Preseason A-List rank: 1

Senior stats: Finished with 92 tackles (48 solo), 12 TFL, 3 sacks, 1 INT, 1 defensive touchdown. One of 12 semifinalists for high school Butkus Award

Recruiting update: Committed to Auburn

Randy Kennedy analysis: Demarcus Riddick is athletic enough to be an outstanding punt returner during his career at Chilton County. His coverage skills are as impressive as his play at the line of scrimmage, leading to the thought that he could be effective at more than one position in college.

Next game: Season over

Booker T. Washington LB Joseph Phillips, right, has played a vital role on offense and defense this year for his team. (Contributed)

6. Joseph Phillips, LB, B.T. Washington

Height/weight: 6-2, 250

Preseason A-List rank: 8

Senior stats: Phillips has played a big role on offense and defense. He has 99 tackles, 28 tackles for loss, 7 sacks, 20 QB hurries and 5 caused fumbles. On offense, he has rushed for 420 yards and 5 TDs on 46 carries and caught 5 passes for 86 yards and 2 TDs.

Recruiting update: Committed to Auburn

Randy Kennedy analysis: Joseph Phillips is a disruptive defensive player who has the versatility to play any position on the front seven. It will be interesting to see how the Auburn staff chooses to utilize Phillips and his consistently high-energy skills.

Next game: at American Christian, Round 1, Class 4A playoffs, Friday

Foley Lion's Perry Thompson carries the ball against the Saraland Spartans in a prep football game at Spartan Stadium on September 29, 2023 (Todd Stacey I preps@al.com)Todd Stacey | preps@al.com

5. Perry Thompson, WR, Foley

Height/weight: 6-3, 202

Preseason A-List rank: 4

Senior stats: The 5-star played on offense, defense and special teams for the Lions. On offense, he completed 5-of-6 passes for 93 yards and 2 TDs, rushed for 102 yards and a TD and caught 53 passes for 718 yards and 7 TDs.

Recruiting update: Committed to Auburn

Randy Kennedy analysis: Perry Thompson has every skill needed to be a superstar receiver on the college level. The next step in his evolution is to be a player who has to be accounted for by the defense on every play.

Next game: Season over

Spanish Fort's Sterling Dixon, right, warms up to play St. Paul's in a prep football game Friday, Oct. 6, 2023, in Spanish Fort, Ala. (Mike Kittrell | preps@al.com)

4. Sterling Dixon, LB/EDGE, Spanish Fort

Height/weight: 6-3, 211

Preseason A-List rank: 7

Senior stats: Dixon made a surprise return from an early-season shoulder injury and hasn’t missed a step. He has 118 tackles, including 28 for a loss. He also has registered 12.5 sacks, 26 QB hurries and an interception.

Recruiting update: Committed to Alabama

Randy Kennedy analysis: Sterling Dixon may eventually make the permanent move to inside linebacker like his mentor and former teammate, Deontae Lawson. For now, his best skill is still as a clever and relentless pass-rusher off the edge.

Next game: vs. Bessemer City, Round 1, Class 6A playoffs, Friday

3. Jeremiah Beaman, DL, Parker

Height/weight: 6-4, 265

Preseason A-List rank: 5

Senior stats: Beaman has 36 tackles, 5 tackles for loss and 5 sacks entering Round 1 of the playoffs.

Recruiting update: Committed to Alabama

Randy Kennedy analysis: Jeremiah Beaman is not just a space-eater who can keep blockers off linebackers. Beaman is a playmaker who has surprisingly good ball skills for a big man.

Next game: vs. Mae Jemison, Round 1, Class 6A playoffs, Friday

Clay-Chalkville's Jaylen Mbakwe looks for a pass during a game at Oxford High School in Oxford, Ala., on Friday, Oct. 20, 2023. (Will McLelland | preps@al.com)

2. Jaylen Mbakwe, ATH/DB, Clay-Chalkville

Height/weight: 5-11, 170

Preseason A-List rank: 2

Senior stats: The longtime Tide commit, who will play defensive back at Alabama, moved to QB for the Cougars this year and has led them to an undefeated season to this point.

Recruiting update: Committed to Alabama

Randy Kennedy analysis: Jaylen Mbakwe has been surprisingly efficient as a quarterback this season, which shows what an incredibly versatile athlete he is. Mbakwe has the kind of speed and change of direction that is reserved for only the most elite prospects.

Next game: vs. Cullman, Round 1, Class 6A playoffs, Friday

1. Cam Coleman, WR, Central-Phenix City

Height/weight: 6-3, 180

Preseason A-List rank: 3

Senior stats: Coleman has been sensational for the top-ranked Red Devils in jumping to No. 1 on the list. He has 40 receptions for 958 yards and 14 TDs entering the playoffs.

Recruiting update: Committed to Texas A&M

Randy Kennedy analysis: Now that he’s committed to Texas A&M, the comparisons to Aggies great Mike Evans are sure to come. Like Evans, Coleman is a complete mismatch on 50-50 balls deep down the field. Unless Saraland wide receiver Ryan Williams decides to reclassify, Coleman should continue to be the best prospect in the state.

Next game: vs. Davidson, Round 1, Class 7A playoffs, Friday
