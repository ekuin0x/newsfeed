                <textarea id="text" readonly> Beware Pakistan! Afghanistan are fighting like never before. Asked to bat first on Wednesday in Hangzhou, China, Afghanistan could manage only 116 runs against Sri Lanka in their 2023 Asian Games, men's cricket quarter-final match. But the total proved seven runs more than required to knock defending champions Sri Lanka out of the competition. Thus, Afghanistan have achieved a measure of revenge against Sri Lanka. More on that later! On Friday, they will take on Pakistan in the second semi-final, for a place in the gold medal match. In the first semi-final, India have defeated Bangladesh by nine wickets with 64 balls to spare. (Scorecard | Full Coverage | Cricket World Cup | Cricket News)

Afghanistan, to start with, are the most consistent side in the Asian Games men's cricket history, albeit without winning the gold medal. Cricket became an Asiad medal sport in 2010, and was included in the 2014 programme too. But somehow, it missed the cut for the subsequent edition. In the 19th edition of the continental multi-sporting extravaganza, teams representing some of the world's finest cricketing nations are jostling for a podium finish.

Beat Pakistan on Friday, and Afghanistan will play in the Asian Games cricket final for the third time in succession. Led by 'biceps flexing' Gulbadin Naib, the Afghans will leave no stone unturned to have another crack at the gold medal. Their desire to compete and fight till the last ball was for all to see in the thrilling quarter-final win over Sri Lanka. Only weeks ago, Afghanistan endured a heart-breaking two-run defeat against Sri Lanka in the 2023 Asia Cup. In many ways, the win will also give a new purpose to this young Afghan side who are without established stars like Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, etc. due to their other, bigger engagement -- the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup in India.

Pakistan, on the other hand, are chasing their maiden final appearance. They claimed bronze in Guangzhou 2010, but a third-place finish did little to assuage the pain of losing to Afghanistan in the semi-finals. After all, Pakistan's cricketing pedigree is second to none. Then, four years later, the PCB -- the country's cricket body -- decided not to send the men's national team to Incheon, South Korea.

This time, in Hangzhou, the Pakistani team led by Qasim Akram will look the exorcise the ghosts of their pasts. By the way, they took some time to find their groove in the quarter-final against Hong Kong, which they eventually won by 68 runs.

The two teams have met six times in T20Is with Pakistan leading the head-to-head record 4-2. In the latest meeting, in March 2023, Pakistan beat Afghanistan by 66 runs. That clash, of course, featured the select XIs from either camp.
