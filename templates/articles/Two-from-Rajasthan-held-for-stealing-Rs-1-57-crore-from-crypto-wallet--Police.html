                <textarea id="text" readonly> THE CYBER wing of the Pune city police arrested two persons for allegedly stealing Rs 1.57 crore from the cryptocurrency wallet of another person.

The accused were identified as Pavankumar Tatvavedi (35) and his brother Pankaj Tatvavedi (35), natives of Rajasthan.

Police said Pavankumar allegedly lured the complainant, a former businessman, to invest money in cryptocurrency trading by assuring huge profit.

According to a press release issued by police on Saturday, Pavankumar allegedly suggested that the complainant buy a “Ledger Nano Wallet”. While guiding the complainant to save cryptocurrency into this wallet, the accused allegedly stole the wallet’s user ID and 24-character “password key”.

Later, the accused allegedly misused the password to transfer the complainant’s cryptocurrency to another ledger wallet.

The businessman lodged an FIR about the alleged fraud at the Cyber police station under sections 419, 420, 406, 34 of the Indian Penal Code.

The investigation revealed that Pavankumar went to Dubai in June 2023 and returned to India on November 16. Police got information that the accused was planning to come to Pune by flight from Jodhpur on November 23.

Accordingly, sleuths of the cyber police station laid a trap and nabbed Pavankumar at the Pune International Airport. </textarea>
