UPDATE: Nov. 25, 2023, 8:00 a.m. EST We've rounded up a giant list of the best early Cyber Monday LEGO deals at various retailers.

We at Mashable are obsessed with Lego sets. (Two editors are currently working their way through the flower bouquets from its Botanical Collection). But we're even bigger fans of finding Lego sets on sale on Cyber Monday: They make fantastic gifts for recipients of all ages and interests, and relaxing distractions during holiday downtime.

We're seeing dozens of great Lego deals at third-party retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target. It's worth mentioning that many of the deals are even better than they appear on retailers' sites, especially Target's, which had made the odd decision to deflate most sets' sticker prices.

No matter: We've rounded up a comprehensive list of the very best early Cyber Monday Lego deals below (divvied up by age and series) with accurate pricing based on MSRPs from the Lego website â€” check them out:

Note: All newly added deals are marked with a âœ¨, while deals with a ðŸ”¥ have dropped to an all-time low price. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.

Why we like it

A hit on TikTok, this 878-piece Lego set for ages 18 and up builds into a miniature tree â€” and you can swap its leaves for bubblegum pink flowers. Amazon and Target both have it on sale for $39.99, or 20% off, which is its lowest price anywhere; Best Buy was offering the same deal earlier in its Black Friday sale, but it's since sold out there.

Why we like it

This brickified version of The Mandalorian's Din Grogu/Baby Yoda is made up of 1,075 pieces and makes a nice challenge for kids 10 and up. It's sold out or stuck at full price everywhere except Walmart, which has it on sale for only $45. That's a 50% savings.
