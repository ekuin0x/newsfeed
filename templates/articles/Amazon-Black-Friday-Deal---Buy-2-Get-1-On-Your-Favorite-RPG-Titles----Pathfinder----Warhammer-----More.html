The Amazon Book Sale means you can buy two and get one free with your favorite RPGs, including Pathfinder, WFRP, and more!

It’s Black Friday and that means it’s time once again to decide which matters more: your RPG collection, or your wallet. Especially if you’re looking to pick up some new RPGs, because this year Amazon has their Black Friday book sale back on.

Which means you can buy two books and get a third free. Which is great, if you were already going to buy two books. And you might have, because these books are often discounted. Good news, if you’re looking to get started with some new RPGs this season, there’s plenty to find, as Amazon’s Black Friday book sale has more than just D&D. It has Pathfinder too.
