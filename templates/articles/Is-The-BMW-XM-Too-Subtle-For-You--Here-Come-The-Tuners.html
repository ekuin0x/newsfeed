                <textarea id="text" readonly> Renegade Design has completed two out of the ten bodykits they are producing for the BMW M flagship

The BMW XM hasn’t exactly set the world on fire in the realm of M models – it’s safe to say, it missed the mark by a fair bit. However, that hasn’t deterred the cavalry of tuners armed with the mission to give it an even more attention-grabbing look (as if it needed any more attention…).

Leading this charge is Renegade Design, sprinting off the line with a tailor-made body kit. They’ve already wrapped up two out of the ten examples included in the first batch.

The Dubai-based tuner had given us a glimpse of the bodykit through digital renderings a few months ago, but now we can feast our eyes on real-life photos of the modified BMW XM in two distinct setups. The first variant boasts a glossy black bodykit, creating an eye-catching contrast with the Crayon Grey vinyl wrap on the bodywork. This kit encompasses wider fenders, a prominent splitter with matching side sills, a rear bumper extension, a diffuser, intake garnish at both ends, and an enlarged rear wing.

The second example looks more sinister, courtesy of an all-black treatment complemented by a naked carbon-fiber rendition of the bodykit. This kit incorporates a carbon-fiber add-on on the hood, which remains visible from the driver’s seat. Furthermore, unlike the white BMW XM that retains the stock wheels, the black SUV rides on a new set of massive 23-inch alloy wheels with a ten-spoke design, featuring red brake calipers behind them. To tie it all together, every XM emblem receives a bold red accent, matching the red leather upholstery that dominates the cabin.

Renegade Design states that their bodykits are handcrafted and individually numbered. If you were curious, the tuner doesn’t provide any enhancements to the chassis or powertrain of the XM. However, this shouldn’t be much of a concern, considering that the BMW M flagship delivers 738 hp (748 PS / 550 kW) and 738 lb-ft (997 Nm) of torque from its stock PHEV powertrain, which comprises a twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 engine and a single electric motor.

The company has chosen not to disclose the pricing for these add-ons, but they are available for worldwide shipping. What’s your preference: the appearance of this more extensively modified BMW XM or a more understated look closer to the stock model? </textarea>
