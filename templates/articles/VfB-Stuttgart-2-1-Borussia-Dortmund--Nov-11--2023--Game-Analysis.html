                <textarea id="text" readonly> BERLIN, Nov 11 (Reuters) - VfB Stuttgart top scorer Serhou Guirassy scored an 83rd minute penalty to steer his team to a 2-1 victory over visiting Borussia Dortmund on Saturday on his comeback from injury.

Guinea international Guirassy who had been out injured for two weeks after a sensational start to the season, came on in the second half and snatched the winner with his spot kick to make it 15 goals in the Bundesliga.

Stuttgart move up to 24 points in third with Dortmund fourth on 21, eight points off leaders Bayern Munich.

The visitors had goalkeeper Gregor Kobel to thank for keeping them in the game in the first half after he first saved a 10th-minute Stuttgart penalty and then stopped Deniz Undav and Enzo Millot in their double golden chance in the 23rd.

Dortmund scored with their first chance in the 36th minute and Niclas Fuellkrug's tap in at the far post. Stuttgart got a deserved equaliser before the break with Undav finally beating Kobel.

Both teams had chances after the restart with Dortmund's Marcel Sabitzer hitting the post just past the hour and after Stuttgart's Chris Fuehrich narrowly fired wide.

But it was Guirassy who stole the spotlight with a well-taken penalty to make it two defeats in a row for Dortmund after last week's 4-0 demolition by Bayern Munich. (Reporting by Karolos Grohmann Editing by Christian Radnedge) </textarea>
