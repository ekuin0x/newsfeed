                <textarea id="text" readonly> Sonos is offering up to 20 percent off select home theater products and up to 25 percent off portable speakers for Black Friday today, representing the year's best prices on many of the company's most popular audio products.

Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Sonos. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.

Sonos very rarely offers straight cash discounts on individual products, with typical sales throughout the year focusing on bundle sales. For Black Friday, the company is finally back with steep markdowns on numerous products, and you don't need to bundle or enter a code for the savings.

The deal prices listed below will last through Cyber Monday on November 27. There's a good mix of devices on sale, including the popular Arc soundbar for $719 ($180 off), cheaper Ray soundbar for $223 ($56 off), Roam Bluetooth speaker for $134 ($45 off), and more.



If you're starting your holiday shopping this week, we've got you covered with guides for the best Black Friday deals for AirPods, iPhone, MacBook, HomePod, Apple Watch, and iPad. We're also keeping an eye on the best overall Apple deals you can get today.

For everything else, we're keeping track of all of the season's best Apple-related deals in our Black Friday roundup, so be sure to check back throughout the day for an updated list of all the most notable discounts you'll find for Black Friday 2023. </textarea>
