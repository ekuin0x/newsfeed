                <textarea id="text" readonly> It's been a year since the video of Emiliano Martinez was shot, just a day before Argentina faced Mexico in arguably the most crucial game of the World Cup in Qatar. The 'Albiceleste' was coming from a surprising defeat on their debut game against Saudi Arabia during the group stage. If they didn't win this game, they would more than likely fly back home after the third match. In this video we are about to show you, Emiliano 'Dibu' Martinez clearly predicts the exact result of the game they were about to play and he also says he will be the tournament's best goalkeeper. If you show this video to any Argentinean, chills will definitely go down their spine. A prediction made on Diego Maradona's second year anniversary of his untimely passing.

'Dibu' Martinez predicts Argentina vs Mexico result Twitter @Argentina

Martinez knew Argentina had a good chance to win

There is no denying that 'Dibu' Martinez was one of the key players of that Argentina squad that ended up winning the World Cup. He was important not only against Mexico on the very next day after making that video. Martine was also crucial in his team's penalty kick shootouts against The Netherlands and France in the final. If it wasn't for his heroics, the 'Albiceleste' wouldn't have made it to the top as they did. A year after this video was recorded, Argentineans are currently going through a bittersweet day for remembering this moment from last year and honoring Diego Maradona three years after his death.

In the coming months, the Argentina squad will face some certain obstacles after manager Lionel Scaloni announced he may not continue as the team's head coach. Should he step down as the manager, this would constitute a massive blow for all Argentineans who wanted him to continue as the team's coach. Martinez hasn't spoken about any of this yet because the information is too recent. But what ever happens, at least Martinez will remain as the lead goalkeeper with the hope they can compete in the 2024 Copa America coming net summer. </textarea>
