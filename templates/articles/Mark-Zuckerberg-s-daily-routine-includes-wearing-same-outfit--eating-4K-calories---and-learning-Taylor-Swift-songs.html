                <textarea id="text" readonly> One of the richest people in the world is learning how to be a Swiftie.

Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wears the same outfit and trains with MMA fighters several times per week as part of the Meta CEO’s stringent daily routine — which now includes learning Taylor Swift songs with his three young daughters.

The Facebook founder, 39, who is currently the world’s 6th richest person per Forbes, starts every morning with a bad habit millions are guilty of — checking their phone immediately, according to Business Insider, which compiled the billionaire’s average day based on his previous interviews.

Zuckerberg wakes up around 8 a.m. and checks Meta’s own Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp platforms on his phone for several minutes or more, depending on current world events, the CEO said in a Facebook Live Q&A in 2016.

“It’s a pretty sad situation to be honest,” he admitted at the time. “I have contacts, and I can’t see very well. And before I put my contacts in I often look to see what is going on Facebook.”

It’s a habit he’s described on the Joe Rogan podcast as “not good.”

“It’s almost like you wake up and you’re punched in the stomach, so it’s, like, OK … now I need to go reset myself and be able to be productive and not be stressed out about this.”

After the social media guilt subsides, the mogul exercises. While he used to just jog, now he has been training in mixed martial arts ahead of a possible “cage match” bout with tech rival and X CEO Elon Musk.

Zuckerberg replaced running about three times a week with three or four jiu-jitsu and MMA sessions weekly, he told Lex Friedman on his podcast in June. He additionally does strength and conditioning work and mobility training.

He suffered a torn ACL while training earlier this month and is still recovering.

While he’s never revealed what he eats for breakfast, Zuckerberg claims he’s been eating 4,000 calories per day to keep up with the intensive training regimen.

A recent McDonald’s order, he wrote on Threads, his X competitor, consists of “20 nuggets, a quarter pounder, large fries, Oreo McFlurry, apple pie, and maybe some cheeseburgers for later?”

The brainiac saves his mind for more pressing decisions by wearing the same outfit every day, he’s said.

To run the world’s largest social media platform, Zuckerberg told CNN in 2015 that he only spends about 50-60 hours per week in the office — adding that he spends “his whole life” constantly thinking and working on the company.

Though his schedule changes due to constant traveling to meet with world leaders and celebrities, he always makes time for his family.

In 2012, he married his longtime Harvard girlfriend, pediatrician Priscilla Chan, and the two share three daughters — Maxima, August and Aurelia.

Each night, Chan said her husband reads or codes with his girls as part of their daily good nights — and is “learning every lyric of the Taylor Swift songs,” she told Forbes in September.

“I basically go through with Max and Augie: ‘What are the things that are most important in life?'” Zuckerberg told Friedman. He said he makes them consider the important aspects of their lives like their health, friends and family.

Chan also told Forbes he sings a Jewish prayer to the children before tucking them in.

Finally, Zuckerberg said he makes sure to head to bed earlier and get a healthy eight hours of sleep, which he tracks with an Oura ring, he told Forbes. </textarea>
