                <textarea id="text" readonly> The Wolfson and Schneider hospitals provided an update on Saturday morning, regarding the condition of the kidnapped women and children who were brought to them after being released from Hamas captivity. They conveyed that their condition is good and stable, and they have reunited with their families. Wolfson Hospital, where five of the released women are currently hospitalized, added that each one is receiving treatment based on the medical examination conducted on Friday by the medical team, and they have been warmly embraced by their families.

At Schneider Hospital, eight of the kidnapped individuals arrived, including four children and four women. According to the medical center, their condition is assessed as good, and currently, they have been all getting together with their families in a designated and separate area, where they were being taken care for by medical and psychosocial teams.

The Adar family reunited with Yaffa, the 85-year-old kidnapping victim who was released on Friday night. Yaffa's granddaughter, Adriana, posted on Facebook with photos from the reunion at the hospital. "She's here! Grandma Yaffa is here!" she wrote. "Healthy, beautiful, and radiant! Thank you to all of Israel! Thank you to everyone who was there for us, supported, and accompanied us." In addition, Adriana addressed Tamir Adar, a family member who is still held captive by Hamas: "A little step closer to freedom, we're waiting for you, Tamir Adar, waiting for everyone! Everyone! Now, right now!"

How did Hamas treat the hostages?

A close relative of the Munder family shared their experiences during their time in Hamas captivity. According to this relative, Ruth Munder, the family’s grandmother, discovered the tragic news of her son Roi's death, which the terrorists had informed them about. "Initially, there weren't many people with them, but at some point, more individuals were added. They had access to a radio and television, where they heard news from Israel. Ruth heard on the radio that her son [Roi Munder] had been killed… The conditions were far from ideal; 80-year-old men and women lied down on plastic benches similar to those in a hospital, without mattresses."

"Fortunately, they did not endure any unpleasant experiences during their captivity; they were treated in a humane manner," continued the family member. "Contrary to our fears, they did not encounter the horrifying stories we had imagined. They described the initial moments of their kidnapping when the terrorists were agitated and threatened to harm them, but once they were on motorcycles, they did not harm them."

Additionally, the Ben-Zvi family from Kibbutz Nir Oz expressed their joy at the return of Jimmy Fatucho, the Filipino caregiver of Amitai Ben-Zvi from Nir Oz, who was tragically murdered. They said, "We are excited about Jimmy's release, and we will do everything in our power to support his reunion with his family." Furthermore, they conveyed that "like all of Nir Oz's families, we are thrilled about the release of the captives and eagerly await the return of the rest of the kidnapped individuals, including Nir Oz and all those from the surrounding areas."

Carmit, the daughter of the released hostage Hannah Katzir, wrote on Facebook that "my heroic mom is with us! She is inspiring and amazing, and she has so much to share." It was previously reported by the Islamic Jihad that Katzir, who is 76 years old, had died in captivity, but her family did not give up hope, and Hannah has returned home. Carmit added that "her return tells us that it is possible, necessary, and immediate - to bring back everyone! Elad [her son] and our hearts are still in Gaza, along with more than 200 worlds and all of them and their families who are suffering from worry, they don't have time! Amidst all the turmoil - a prisoner of thanks that I have my mom back." Advertisement

‏Returned Children Department Director at Schneider Children's Medical Center, Professor Gilat Livni, reported that the medical condition of the children is "reasonable." According to her, some of them are in better condition, and some are in less favorable condition, but overall, it's a reasonable medical state. She added that she believes they will be released from the hospital in the coming days. "The supportive environment we have prepared for them has helped calm them down, and they have requested to stay a little longer to emotionally regroup," she explained.

Furthermore, Professor Livni shared that the released hostages have shared some of their "experiences." She said, "We don't ask many questions, but they tell stories, and we listen. Sometimes we cry with them, but I can't share their stories." She continued, "They went to sleep at around 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning, so they didn't sleep very well, but I believe it will improve in the coming days."

Yoni Asher, whose wife Doron and daughters Raz (4) and Aviv (2) were kidnapped to Gaza, responded yesterday to their release: "My family, Doron, Raz, and Aviv, have returned home from captivity. I am determined to help my family recover from the trauma and the terrible loss we have endured, for the sake of the future of our children and Doron. We have challenging days ahead. I must express my gratitude and appreciation to our sons who have shown incredible resilience, to the IDF, the Israeli government, and the War Cabinet who are working tirelessly. Thank you to the wonderful people of Israel for their support. A big thank you to the Families of the Kidnapped who are working to bring them all back.

"I am not celebrating, I will not celebrate until the last of the hostages returns. I want to emphasize that our children, our fathers, our mothers, our siblings are still in captivity at this moment. Some people's hearts are broken right now, and I want to ensure that all the hostages return home. The families of the kidnapped are not just posters or slogans; they are real people, and the families of the kidnapped Israelis are my new family from today, and I will make sure that the last of the hostages returns home. Thank you all."

The Families of the Kidnapped Headquarters also released a statement on behalf of the grandchildren of Yaffa Edri, who was released from Hamas captivity, in which they said, "Don't stop until the last hostage returns home." It was also stated that "We ask everyone to remember that we still cannot see the sun because there are still many people there. Today, at 7:00 PM, we will all gather with the people of Israel in Kidnapped Square to embrace the families who have not yet embraced their loved ones." </textarea>
