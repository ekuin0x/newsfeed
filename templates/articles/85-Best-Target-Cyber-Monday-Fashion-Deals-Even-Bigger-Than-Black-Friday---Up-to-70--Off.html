                <textarea id="text" readonly> If you’re like me, you probably spent the vast majority of the last three days clicking back and forth between the seemingly endless number of sales that kicked off on Black Friday (and well before). But now that Cyber Monday has arrived, it’s bringing even more deals with it, and Target’s huge sale on clothing, shoes, and handbags is another one worth adding to your must-shop list.

Discounts at the retailer have been dropping like flies all month, leading up to the pinnacle of the holiday sale season. In time for Cyber Monday, Target carried over many of its Black Friday savings and added thousands, including comfy winter dresses, cozy clothing like leggings and soft sweaters, shoes including fuzzy boots and sneakers, and practical yet stylish handbags. Our top picks are up to 70 percent off, many for today only, so you’ll want to hit add to cart right away.

Best Target Cyber Monday Fashion Deals

Some of my personal favorites include $25 Jockey joggers that look more put together than baggy pairs and these heeled loafers that lean into the style that Taylor Swift recently wore. I’m also eying this spacious patchwork weekender bag that’s just $30 right now and can fit the Mary Poppins-level of items I carry around with me on the reg. Below, find even bigger discounts from Target’s sale.

Best Target Cyber Monday Dress Deals

As you’re prepping for the holiday party circuit, you can update your dress collection so you’ve got a new go-to for (almost) every event. Cyber Monday at Target includes long-sleeve dress deals like this cutout sweater style that can be thrown on with knee-high boots, plus more fitted silhouettes like this one from A New Day with slits up the leg for easy movement. You can also find flowy styles with prints and florals to remind us of warmer weather. For comfort above all, grab this hooded sweatshirt dress that shoppers say is “super soft” and lightweight.”

Best Target Cyber Monday Cozy Clothing Deals

When I think of winter-ready fashion, the first (and admittedly, only) thing that comes to mind is cozy. I want warm, soft fabrics that aren’t restricting, and Target’s Cyber Monday sale has just that. These joggers from my go-to Target loungewear brand, Stars Above, are 30 percent off, along with these fitted joggers with stretchy spandex fabric that keeps you “warm and comfortable” for 52 percent off. I’m also a big fan of Target’s bras, and it has bralettes starting at just $5, including this reversible style and this smoothing one that “doesn’t even feel like you are wearing one.”

Best Target Cyber Monday Outerwear Deals

Just because the temperatures are taking a nosedive doesn’t mean you have to go full Randy from A Christmas Story. Target has jacket deals that are practical yet cute, like this single-breasted coat in a Kate Middleton blue, a fleece piece, or this fuzzy faux fur cropped style available in white, gray, and black that one reviewer said is “surprisingly warmer than expected.” If you do like a puffer style, though, grab this Lands’ End down coat that’s warm but “so light it feels like you aren’t wearing anything.”

Best Target Cyber Monday Shoe Deals

Footwear is on super sale today, too, including boots like this over-the-knee look for 62 percent off and these mini platform ones that resemble pricier pairs. You can also find loafers, a style celebs keep reaching for, marked down including platform options, heeled loafers, and flat, comfy pairs. And since I practically live in slippers during the winter to keep my feet toasty on my hard flooring, I’m eyeing this pair with a wool blend lining that are “absolutely gorgeous and so comfy,” per one customer.

Best Target Cyber Monday HandBag Deals

Some of the biggest deals during Target’s Cyber Monday sale come from its handbag collection, which includes totes, crossbody bags, belt bags, and more. This weekender is 70 percent off in all three neutral colors, and it’s “very roomy,” according to one shopper. Get lightweight Vera Bradley pieces for less, like this quilted featherweight tote that’s water-repellant, has hidden pockets, and holds “everything” you need “without being cumbersome.” If you want a smaller bag, this Kipling crossbody fully leans into the metallic of-the-moment look seen on celebs.
