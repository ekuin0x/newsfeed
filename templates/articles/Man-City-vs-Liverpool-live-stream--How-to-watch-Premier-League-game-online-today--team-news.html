Man City have gone up a gear in recent weeks, while Liverpool have similarly improved as the season has progressed. It is no surprise then, that these teams go into today's match as the top two in the league.

The visitors have a relatively poor record at the Etihad Stadium, including a 4-1 walloping last season, but the likes of Mo Salah and Darwin Nunez will provide enough firepower to trouble the suspect City defence. Off the pitch, the touchline antics of Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola should provide some extra spice.

The Citizens have had a number of injury concerns. These included Erling Haaland, but the superstar striker has recovered from a knock and starts. Curtis Jones and Alexis Mac Allister are back for the Reds.

Here's how they line up:

Man City: Ederson, Walker, Akanji, Dias, Ake, Rodri, Bernardo, Doku, Foden, Alvarez, Haaland

Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Matip, Van Dijk, Tsimikas, Mac Allister, Szoboszlai, Jones, Salah, Nunez, Jota

Man City’s last league match was their dramatic 4-4 draw with Chelsea, one of the games of the season so far. Man City vs Liverpool is set to be another classic, so make sure you don’t miss any of the EPL action by checking out our full how to watch Premier League live streams hub.

Using a VPN is incredibly simple.

1. Install the VPN of your choice. As we've said, ExpressVPN is our favorite.

2. Choose the location you wish to connect to in the VPN app. For instance, if you're in the U.K. and want to view a U.S. service, you'd select U.S. from the list.

3. Sit back and enjoy the action. Head to Peacock or another service and watch the game.
