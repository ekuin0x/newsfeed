                <textarea id="text" readonly> I tried using AI to generate gift ideas for big names in tech.

Some gift ideas were better or more realistic than others.

ChatGPT suggested a custom Apple watch band for Tim Cook and a stargazing experience for Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez.

We can use AI to do a vast array of things — write cover letters, contest medical bills, analyze data, write code, and assist with time management. Why not use it to plan your holiday shopping and brainstorm some gift ideas for your loved ones?

I tried it out, subbing out my loved ones for a few of the biggest names in tech, like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Tim Cook.

While there are some AI tools out there specifically meant for personal shopping and gift idea generating, I stuck to good old ChatGPT as a baseline — though, for tech leaders of companies with their own AI Chatbots, like Google's Sundar Pichai with Google Bard, I used those chatbots as well.

I prompted ChatGPT to give me a few specific gift ideas for each name with varying results — check out the AI's recommendations below. </textarea>
