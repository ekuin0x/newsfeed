Borussia Dortmund fans issued a strong message in protest against the UEFA Champions League reforms and money in football during their group stage clash against Newcastle United on Tuesday.

The Borussia Dortmund supporters have never been shy about their feelings towards the UEFA Champions League reforms that are set to come into effect next season. And the Yellow Wall held a banner protesting against them once again during BVB’s Champions League group stage clash against Newcastle United on Tuesday.

The first banner read, “You don’t care about the sport – All you care about is money!” Another banner featuring images of former Juventus boss Andrea Agnelli, FIFA president Gianni Infantino, and Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi was also held up by supporters at the start of the second-half in protest against the increasing money and greed in football.

And a third banner with a link to the campaign website protesting against the UEFA Champions League reforms was also displayed.

In addition, fake gold bars and bags of money were also thrown on the pitch, causing a slight delay to the game.

The UEFA Champions League will undergo a massive reform next season, with a total of 36 teams set to compete in the competition. The group stage will be replaced by a league phase, with teams playing eight matches instead of six.

This is not the first time Borussia Dortmund fans have protested against the UEFA Champions League reforms and the increasing money in football. Similar banners were also displayed during the Bundesliga clash against Bayern Munich this past weekend, and also earlier in the season. </textarea>
