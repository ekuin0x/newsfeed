Dell Cyber Monday Deals on Gaming PCs

Not everyone is the DIY type, and building your own PC is definitely not for everyone. If you're in the market for a prebuilt gaming PC, Dell is one of best brands we'd recommend. The Alienware gaming desktops offer a staggering array of options, all built into a custom chassis that's both easy on the eyes and easy on the wallet. Consistent build quality, available inventory, frequent sales, and solid customer service are the main reasons why Dell is at the top of our buying list.

Alienware Aurora R16 RTX 4070 Ti Gaming PC for $1749.99

New 2023 Model Alienware Aurora R16 Liquid Cooled Intel Core i7-13700F RTX 4070 Ti Gaming PC with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 1000W 80PLUS Platinum PSU 10% off $1,949.99 14 $1,749.99 See on Dell

The R16 is the newest Alienware Aurora gaming desktop for 2023. The R16 chassis is 40% smaller in volume compared to previous iterations. It features a simple yet proven airflow design; air is drawn in through the side intake vents over the GPU area as well as a 120mm rear fan drawing air in and a generously sized 240mm all-in-one liquid cooler exhausts air out through the top. A side benefit is that the GPU is supplied with fresh air from the outside instead of recirculating hot internal air. Speaking of which, the RTX 4070 Ti performs significantly better than the RTX 4070 or 3080. This is an ideal choice for playing games at high refresh rates at 1440p or for comfortable 4K gaming.

Alienware Aurora R16 RTX 4060 Gaming PC for $1099.99

Alienware Aurora R16 Intel Core i7-13700F RTX 4060 Gaming PC with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD 19% off $1,349.99 7 $1,099.99 See on Dell

This is an excellent price for the newest generation Alienware Aurora R16 equipped with a 13th gen Intel Core i7 Raptor Lake CPU and a current gen GeForce RTX 4060 GPU. The RTX 4060 is considerably more powerful than the RTX 3060 and almost nearly matches the RTX 3060 Ti. I would recommend this card for comfortable 1080p gaming although you can also run games at 1440p.

Alienware Aurora R16 RTX 4060 Ti Gaming PC for $1299.99

Alienware Aurora R16 Liquid-Cooled Intel Core i7-13700F RTX 4060 Ti PC with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD 19% off $1,599.99 1 $1,299.99 See on Dell

The RTX 4060 Ti 8GB video card is considerably more powerful than the RTX 4060. Compared to the previous gen GPUs, it's about 5%-10% faster than the RTX 3060 Ti at 1080p.

Dell XPS RTX 4060 Ti Gaming PC for $1299.99

32GB RAM and 3TB of Combined Storage

New Dell XPS Intel Core i7-13700 RTX 4060 Ti Gaming PC with 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 2TB HDD 28% off $1,829.99 22 $1,299.99 See on Dell

This Dell XPS PC is equipped just as well as any Alienware gaming PC but in a simpler and more understated chassis. It features an Intel Core i7-13700 CPU and GeForce RTX 4060 Ti GPU, which are great components for the price. Even better, though, is that this PC comes with a whopping 32GB of DDR5 RAM as well as dual storage drives: a 1TB NVMe SSD boot drive and a 2TB 7200RPM hard drive for storage.

HP Cyber Monday Deals on Gaming PCs

HP carries a number of different gaming models. There's the premium HP OMEN lineup (including the 45L, the 40L, and the 25L), the budget-minded Victus lineup, and the hybrid gaming/productivity ENVY lineup. The OMEN gaming PCs are generally better built with more robust cooling, higher-end CPU and GPU options, better components, more future upgradeability, and snazzy looks. They also come in various price points, with the 45L being the most expensive and the 25L being the least expensive.

Check out our HP Cyber Monday article for more HP deals.

HP OMEN 45L Intel Core i9-13900K RTX 4090 PC for $2969.99

Use code: 10BFCM23 HP OMEN 45L Liquid Cooled Intel Core i9-13900K RTX 4090 PC with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 1TB HDD Use promo code "10BFCM23" 26% off $3,999.99 32 $2,969.99 See on HP

HP is offering its flagship HP OMEN 45L gaming PC equipped with a 13th gen Intel Core i9-13900K Raptor Lake CPU and GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for $2969.99 after a 10% off coupon code: "10BFCM23". The OMEN 45L is a very roomy chassis with plenty of cooling in the form of three 120mm fans for system airflow and a 240mm AIO liquid cooled CPU. This PC is also equipped with a massive 1200W 80PLUS Gold power supply. The RTX 4090 is far and away the most powerful video card you can get right now, leaving competitors like AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX in the dust..

HP OMEN 45L Intel Core i7 RTX 4070 Gaming PC for $1619.99

Use code: 10BFCM23 HP OMEN 45L Liquid Cooled Intel Core i7-13700K RTX 4070 Gaming PC with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD Select Graphics Card - RTX 4070 (+$120) Use promo code "10BFCM23" 40% off $2,439.99 0 $1,457.99 See on HP

Select Graphics Card - GeForce RTX 4070 (+$120)

You don't have to splurge on an RTX 4090 to get HP's finest chassis. This model tones it down a bit with an Intel Core i7 processor and an RTX 4070 GPU, but it's still housed in the same OMEN 45L tower and the CPU is still chilled by the same 240mm AIO liquid cooler. The GeForce RTX 4070 matches the performance of the older RTX 3080 but with support for newer tech like DLSS 3.0. The RTX 4070 can easily hold its own in any game at 1080p and 1440p and even has the chops to manage most games at 4K.

HP OMEN 40L RTX 4060 Ti Gaming PC for $1016.99

Use code: 10BFCM23 HP OMEN 40L Intel Core i5-13400 RTX 4060 Ti Gaming PC with 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD Select Graphics Card - RTX 4060 Ti (+$130) Use promo code "10BFCM23" 38% off $1,629.99 2 $1,016.99 See on HP

Select Graphics Card - GeForce RTX 4070 (+$130)

This is one of the least expensive RTX 4060 equipped gaming PCs we've seen so far for Black Friday from the "big three" vendors (Dell, HP, Lenovo). The RTX 4060 Ti is the perfect 1080p gaming GPU (it's a considerably upgrade over the RTX 4060) and it's paired with a very capable 13th gen Intel Core i5-13400 CPU. In terms of gaming performance, the i5 on par with the i7 processor since most games can't take advantage of the higher-core count that the i7 offers.

Lenovo Cyber Monday Deals on Gaming PCs

Lenovo Legion gaming PCs and laptops generally feature better and more rugged build quality than what you'd find from most other prebuilt PCs. People like the fact that Lenovo does not use many proprietary components in their rigs, so the PCs are much easier to upgrade with easiy obtainable, off-the-shelf parts. Lenovo gaming rigs employ solid cooling even if you opt for the base models, although the best models do come with a super robust 360mm all-in-one liquid cooling solution. Finally, Lenovo's warranty and tech support is more proven and more reliable than most boutique builders.

Lenovo Legion Tower 5 Gen 8 RTX 4070 PC for $1231.99

Use code: EXTRA5 Lenovo Legion Tower 5 Gen 8 AMD Ryzen 7 7700 RTX 4070 Gaming PC with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD Use promo code "EXTRA5" 32% off $1,819.99 14 $1,231.99 See on Lenovo

The Lenovo Legion Tower 5 Gen 8 is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 7700 CPU, GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, 16GB of DDR5-5200MHz RAM, and a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD. The AMD Ryzen 7 7700 CPU is cooled by a very robust air-cooled 120mm tower heatsink. There are three additional 120mm system fans to maintain proper ambient temps, both for the CPU and the rest of the components. The GeForce RTX 4070 matches the performance of the RTX 3080. Unlike the RTX 3080, it features DLSS 3.0, so it will perform better on games that support it. This is an outstanding card for both 1080p and 1440p gaming, although it can do perfectly well in 4K depending on the games you play and your settings.

Lenovo Legion 7i Gen 8 RTX 4070 Ti Gaming PC for $1629

Use code: HOLIDAYSURPRISE Lenovo Legion Tower 7i Gen 8 AMD Ryzen 9 7900 RTX 4070 Ti Gaming PC with 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD Use promo code "HOLIDAYSURPRISE" 34% off $2,579.99 0 $1,704.99 See on Lenovo

This config is housed in a Legion Tower 7 case, which is physically larger in size and accomodates three more system fans than the Legion Tower 5 case for even better airflow: two more 120mm fans up top and one more 120mm fan up front for a total of 6 fans. The RTX 4070 Ti performs better significantly better than the RTX 4070 or 3080. This is a better card if you want to push very high refresh rates at 1440p or if you want something that can handle 4K comfortably without paying over $1K for an RTX 4080 or 4090.

Lenovo Legion 7i Gen 8 RTX 4080 PC for $2069.99

Use code: HOLIDAYSURPRISE Lenovo Legion 7i Gen 8 Intel Core i7-13700KF RTX 4080 Gaming PC with 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD Use promo code "HOLIDAYSURPRISE" 31% off $2,989.99 12 $2,069.99 See on Lenovo

The RTX 4080 is a beast of a GPU that should run any game you can throw at it, even at 4K resolution. On the AMD front, only the Radeon RX 7900 XTX can keep up (and that's if you ignore DLSS and ray tracing).

Lenovo Legion 5i Gen 8 RTX 3060 Gaming PC for $759.99

Use code: HOLIDAYSURPRISE Lenovo Legion Tower 5i Intel Core i5-13400F RTX 3060 Gaming PC with 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD Use promo code "HOLIDAYSURPRISE" 39% off $1,249.99 18 $759.99 See on Lenovo

Should you upgrade your gaming PC?

Of course the answer completely depends on your situation. However, in terms of technical advancements, both the newer CPUs and newer GPUs this time around are significant improvements over any gaming PC built in 2021 or earlier. The new 13th and 14th gen Intel Core i7 and i9 and AMD Ryzen 7 7000 CPUs, as well as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4000 series GPUs are powerful enough to tackle any game that has been released, and at up to 4K resolution. Prices are better this year as well; the supply shortages brought about by COVID have mostly been resolved.

Gaming CPUs to consider

The 13th gen and 14th gen Intel Core i5 and i7 CPUs are pretty significant improvements over the 12th gen Intel Alder Lake CPU (which itself was a huge upgrade over its precedessors). If you have an 11th gen or older CPU, than you'll see some real performance gains by upgrading to the newer CPUs.

On the AMD side, the Ryzen 7000 series processors are also a noticeable step up. For gamers, the 7800X3D and 5800X3D are incredible gaming chips at a solid price. For multi-tasking, the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X is still the king. For those on a budget, the Ryzen 5 5600 will probably do everything you'll ever want to do at a truly affordable price. See our guide comparing Intel and AMD CPUs for more info.

Gaming GPUs to consider

For gamers with deep pockets, the GeForce RTX 4090 sets a new bar in gaming performance. It's the one card that can push 4K @ 60fps with ray tracing in any game out there, although the RTX 4080 does come close to achieving that at nearly $500 less. As you get lower down the RTX 40 series ladder, the RTX 30 series cards still hold their own. The RTX 4070 Ti is a solid card for budget 4K gaming, but the RTX 4070 is only about as powerful as the RTX 3080, so you should get whatever is less expensive. The RTX 4060 Ti (depending on the amount of VRAM it has) is equivalent to the RTX 3070 and the RTX 4060 is a bit more powerful than the RTX 3060.

AMD has great video cards this time around, and they're often a better value than the GeForce variants. The flagship Radeon RX 7900 XTX is more powerful than the RTX 4080 until you factor in DLSS and ray tracing performance. The RX 7900 XT is roughly on par with the RTX 4070 Ti and the RX 6800 XT is similar in performance to the RTX 4070. </textarea>
