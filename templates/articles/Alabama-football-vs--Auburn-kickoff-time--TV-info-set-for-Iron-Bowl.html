                <textarea id="text" readonly> Alabama football and Auburn have a game time set for this year's Iron Bowl.

The No. 9 Crimson Tide will face the Tigers at 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 26 at Bryant-Denny Stadium. The game will be broadcast on CBS.

The Crimson Tide (8-2. 5-2 SEC) will look to win a third consecutive Iron Bowl when the Tigers travel to Tuscaloosa this month. Alabama defeated Auburn 24-22 in four overtimes in Auburn last season. In 2020, the Crimson Tide won by a much greater margin: 42-13.

First, though, Alabama will face Austin Peay (7-3, 3-2 ASUN) on Saturday (11 a.m., SEC Network+) at Bryant-Denny Stadium. Auburn (4-6, 2-5) will compete against Western Kentucky (7-4, 5-2 Conference USA) on Saturday (3 p.m., SEC Network)

There won't be anything on the line in terms of the SEC Championship Game or a College Football Playoff spot. Neither Alabama nor Auburn will make either. Of course, that doesn't matter for the gravity of this game. It's the Iron Bowl.

The all-time record is 48-37-1 in favor of the Crimson Tide. Auburn hasn't won an Iron Bowl in Tuscaloosa since 2010.

On the opposite sideline from Alabama coach Nick Saban will be an interim head coach. Cadillac Williams is filling the spot left vacant after the Tigers fired Bryan Harsin at the end of October. Williams picked up his first win when Auburn beat Texas A&M 13-10 on Nov. 12.

Williams hasn't been a head coach in this rivalry, but he is no stranger to it. He has served as Auburn's running backs coach since 2019. He also played for the Tigers in the early 2000s.
