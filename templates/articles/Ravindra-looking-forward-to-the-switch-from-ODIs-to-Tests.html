Ravindra looking forward to the switch from ODIs to Tests

After a sensational performance in the 2023 World Cup New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra described his cricketing journey as 'pretty surreal' and he is now eager to make an impact for the team in red-ball cricket. Rachin, who played his last Test against Bangladesh in Mount Maunganui in January 2022, was included in the New Zealand side for the two-match Test series against Bangladesh on the back of his remarkable performance in the World Cup where he scored 543 runs that included three centuries and two half-centuries.

"Pretty surreal," Rachin said in Sylhet as New Zealand prepared to take on the hosts in the first Test from November 28 which marks the start of the third cycle of the World Test Championship for both teams. "Things have happened quite quickly, and I am very fortunate to be here right now. At my age, being able to travel around the world playing cricket, playing a game you love for a living, is pretty special. [It] definitely has its ups and downs, but mostly I love every single moment.

"Look, I think it's a testament to the team environment: to be able to come in and play with freedom, and enjoy my time learning from those guys who have been here for so long. It's been great to rub shoulders with everyone, and hopefully I can keep learning from them."

Rachin doesn't feel it will be a problem for him to switch from white-ball format to Tests although he is aware that five-day cricket will require a different temperament.

"I enjoy going back to red-ball cricket after that (ODIs) because that means your intent... you are almost looking to score, so, I mean, [it] keeps you in a good position to score," said Rachin. "But probably here [in Bangladesh] it depends on the conditions, what the pitch is doing and it's probably going to dial that back a little bit, not as many risks. You can still play your natural game, by understanding the surface and the situation of the game dictates you.

"I think we sometimes don't understand how long a Test match really is - you have five days of 90 overs each day, so there's a lot of time here, so hopefully we can bring that calmness in the group from the one-dayers to the red-ball stuff. I really loved my first experience of Test cricket a couple of years ago, and [I am] really excited to see how my game has evolved," he said.

Ravindra has a little bit of experience playing Test cricket in Asia, having made his debut during the New Zealand tour of India in 2021. "(We need to) bowl quicker than what we are accustomed to back home. If you are putting it in the area and dialing up the pace a bit more, hopefully have a bit of success," said Ravindra.

Ravindra also admitted that his role with the bat will be a different one compared to the World Cup where he batted at No.3, with the 24-year old likely to feature in the middle order for his team.

"It's a different role for sure; it's not a new ball - I might come in and straightaway face a spinner. So [it's] just [about] wrapping your head around that and seeing what sort of way you can adjust your game plan and get used to facing slower bowling instead of seam up top. But the beauty of it [is that] you contribute whatever way you can for the team no matter what role it is, and hopefully you contribute to a win," he said.
