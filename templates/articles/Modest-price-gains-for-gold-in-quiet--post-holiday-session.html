                <textarea id="text" readonly> (Kitco News) - Gold prices are modestly higher and just below $2,000 in subdued early U.S. trading Friday. Silver prices are posting slight gains. Some chart-based buying is featured to end the trading week, as the technical postures for both metals lean bullish. A weaker U.S. dollar index today is also friendly for the metals. However, weaker crude oil prices and an uptick in U.S. Treasury yields are bearish outside-market elements limiting the upside for gold and silver. December gold was last up $3.90 at $1,996.70.December silver was last up $0.057 at $23.745.

Asian and European markets were mixed to lower in overnight trading. U.S. stock indexes are pointed to mixed openings when the New York day session begins. The U.S. stock and financial markets close early today, due to the Thanksgiving holiday that was Thursday. Today is typically one of the quietest trading days of the year as many U.S. market participants stretch out a four-day weekend.

In overnight news, Israel and Hamas have agreed to a four-day ceasefire, with Israel agreeing to stop its military actions in Gaza, while Hamas releases some of the Israeli hostages in exchange. Risk appetite in the marketplace is up-ticked the past few weeks, as the Middle East conflict has not escalated (at least not yet) the way many market watchers thought it might.

The key outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index lower. Nymex crude oil prices are lower and trading around $76.75 a barrel. The OPEC-plus meeting originally scheduled for this weekend has been moved back to next week, reportedly due to disagreements on whether to further cut the cartel's collective crude oil production. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note is presently fetching 4.465%.

U.S. economic data due for release Friday includes the U.S. flash services and manufacturing purchasing managers indexes (PMI).

Technically, the gold futures bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage. Bulls' next upside price objective is to produce a close in December futures above solid resistance at the October high of $2,019.70. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the November low of $1,935.60. First resistance is seen at this week's high of $2,009.80 and then at $2,019.70. First support is seen at Wednesday's low of $1,988.60 and then at Tuesday's low of $1,979.90. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 6.0

The silver bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage. Silver bulls' next upside price objective is closing December futures prices above solid technical resistance at $25.00. The next downside price objective for the bears is closing prices below solid support at the November low of $21.925. First resistance is seen at $24.00 and then at the November high of $24.22. Next support is seen at this week's low of $23.30 and then at $23.00. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 6.0. </textarea>
