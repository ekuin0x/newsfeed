                <textarea id="text" readonly> Chelsea started the match on the front foot, but our initial impetus died away after ten minutes and Newcastle started taking control of proceedings.

A defensive breakdown let the home side get in front, with Alexander Isak played onside by a broken defensive line and the striker making no mistake in smashing his effort beyond a helpless Sánchez.

But Chelsea equalized with a tremendous Raheem Sterling free kick not long after.

Neither team were able to make their chances count the rest of the first half, with Joelinton’s glaring miss at one end answered by Gallagher’s own glaring miss at the other. Enzo drew a good save from Pope as well, while Badiashile was unlucky to head straight into the goalkeeper’s hands from a corner.

The entertaining first-half was followed by a far less entertaining second, which began in promising fashion but quickly turned to disaster with two goals conceded in just 90 seconds right on the hour mark.

First, our defensive organization was once again exposed in the second phase of a set piece, then Thiago Silva kicked into the ground to gift the ball to Joelinton to slot home.

Reece James put the cherry on top of that sequence by getting sent off in the 73rd minute for a second yellow for a silly foul (picking up the first for an equally silly kicking away of the ball in the first half).

Newcastle would add a fourth just for good measure.

Carefree.

Two changes from our previous game, with Badiashile coming in for Disasi and Ugochukwu getting the start for a half-fit Caicedo

Referee called a harsh game, but we didn’t adjust. Six yellows and countless fouls (19). (Four yellows and many fouls (13) for Newcastle as well; but in much less dangerous positions.)

Cucurella and James out of the next game for yellow-card accumulation and red card, respectively

Next up: Brighton at home next Sunday
