To start off, HP is offering its flagship HP OMEN 45L gaming PC equipped with the 13th gen Intel Core i9-13900K Raptor Lake CPU and GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for only $2969.99 after a new 10% off coupon code "10BFCM23". This the least expensive RTX 4090 gaming PC we've seen so far for Black Friday, and, surprisingly, it's certainy not gimped in any way.

Cyber Monday Deal: HP OMEN 45L Intel Core i9 RTX 4090 PC for $2970

Use code: 10BFCM23 HP OMEN 45L Liquid Cooled Intel Core i9-13900K RTX 4090 PC with 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 1TB HDD Use promo code "10BFCM23" 26% off $3,999.99 32 $2,969.99 See on HP

The 2022 OMEN 45L is HP's flagship gaming PC. This is HP's roomiest chassis with plenty of cooling in the form of three 120mm fans for system airflow and a liquid cooled CPU. This PC is also equipped with an efficient 800W 80PLUS Gold power supply and current-gen components like an Intel Z790 motherboard, Kingston FURY DDR5 RGB memory modules, and a WD Black SSD.

This config is equipped with a top-of-the-line CPU and GPU. The Intel Core i9-13900K is a 13th generation unlocked Raptor Lake processor with a max boost speed of 5.8GHz with 24 cores, 32 threads, and a 36MB cache. This is one of the most powerful desktop CPUs available at the moment.

Likewise, RTX 4090 is far and away the most powerful video card you can get right now, leaving competitors like AMD's latest Radeon RX 7900 XTX in the dust. It's also ridiculously more powerful than any of the RTX 30 series cards: it's up to 90% faster than the 3080 Ti. The 4090 is the one and only solution to ray-traced 4K gaming at consistent 60+fps. If you're still not convinced, check out our RTX 4090 review.
