                <textarea id="text" readonly> The Xperia 1 VI (and 5 VI) are reportedly on the way as new flagship and sub-flagship Android smartphones respectively with the latest camera tweaks from Sony. They are said to go beyond hardware and into the "in-camera digital signature" tech also headed to flagship DSLRs of the same brand. The new digital signature is intended to counter the potential risks of images made or altered by AI.

The next Sony flagship smartphone is thought to backed to tackle rivals such as the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra by augmenting the classic Xperia 1-series design with premium materials including titanium and next-gen Gorilla Glass Victus. Now, the VI (or Mark 6) is also thought to come prepared to meet the unique challenges devices of its era with the kind of cameras it is rumored to pack are almost certain to face.

Sony has announced that it is ready for these issues surrounding the "altered or manipulated imagery" associated with generative AI. Given that the OEM believes that it is particularly detrimental to society on its "dissemination" through the media, it has partnered with the Associated Press to ensure that its "in-camera authenticity tech" is now nearly ready to go.

The new development is rated to generate "machine-based digital signatures" from "inside the camera at the moment of capture in the hardware chipset". Sony asserts that each one comprises a "birth certificate" for a given image, thus (ideally) proving they were taken by a real person in authentic settings.

The ability to create images with such signatures is conferred by firmware, and is scheduled to arrive via an update on the a7S III, a9 III and alpha 1 "in the Spring of 2024" - and as part of the Xperia 1 VI, not to mention the 5 VI, on their respective debuts.
