                <textarea id="text" readonly> When Felix Auger-Aliassime arrived in Malaga, Spain, for this week’s Davis Cup Finals, the Canadian tennis star strolled onto the quiet centre court to take in the scene.

It was on this very court that Auger-Aliassime secured his country’s maiden Davis Cup crown a year ago, and he’ll look to do so again this week.

The week has taken on extra gravitas with the surprise triumph of the Canadian women’s team – led by Leylah Fernandez – who roared to its first Billie Jean King Cup title just a couple of weeks ago.

Canada, once know for its hockey, skiing and skating, has the two number one tennis teams – in the world.

“It’s a beautiful thing to think that we have both [the] men and women number one” teams, Auger-Aliassime told reporters Sunday (19 November) in Malaga. “For me, growing up that seemed very far [away]. It speaks to how much we’ve grown as a country in this sport.”

He added: “The women are putting the pressure on us now... which is good! It’s good to have both men’s and women’s tennis in our country pushing each other to the highest ranking.”

The men’s quest to go back-to-back at Davis Cup begins Tuesday (21 November) against a Finnish team that is not to be under-rated. It’s the beginning of what Felix and co. hope is step one to a repeat title – not done in this event since Czechia defended its Cup a decade ago (2012-13). </textarea>
