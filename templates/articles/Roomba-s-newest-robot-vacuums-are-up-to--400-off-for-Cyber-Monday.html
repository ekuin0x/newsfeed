                <textarea id="text" readonly> With a new owner looming, iRobot is already getting into the Amazon discounting game by dropping the prices on its brand-new vacuums this Cyber Monday. On Friday, it started with its new budget and midrange lines, the Roomba Combo i5 Plus and Combo j5 Plus, and on Sunday, iRobot slashed $400 off its new top-of-the-line models, the j9 Plus and Combo j9 Plus.

The Roomba j9 Plus is the company’s flagship robot vacuum and is on sale for $599, down from $899 at Amazon. It comes with a self-empty dock and all the smarts of the Roomba j7, including AI-powered obstacle avoidance to steer clear of household clutter such as cords, clothes, shoes, and pet poop, plus higher suction power than the j7. It also adds the option of three vacuuming levels (previously only found on the Roomba s9) and has a new feature called Dirt Detective that learns which rooms are dirtiest in your home and cleans them first.

Roomba j9 Plus $ 600 $ 900 33 % off $ 600 $ 600 $ 900 33 % off The j9 Plus is one of Roomba’s latest robot vacuums and features advanced mapping and an auto emptying dock. $600 at Amazon

Roomba Combo j9 Plus $ 999 $ 1399 29 % off $ 999 $ 999 $ 1399 29 % off The Combo j9 Plus is Roomba’s latest top of the line robot vacuum with integrated mopping features. It is the first Roomba that can refill its own mop as well as empty its bin, and the new self-empty/fill dock has a stylish design that can also act as a side table. $999 at Amazon

The Roomba Combo j9 Plus mopping version is also $400 off, on sale for $999, down from $1,399. This is the first Roomba that can refill its own mop reservoir as well as empty its bin. Its redesigned self-empty/fill dock has a new stylish look that’s also practical — its wooden top can act as a side table, and it has space for extra supplies for the robot. Unlike most other mopping robots, the Combo j9 has a retractable mop that it can lift up over its body when it needs to vacuum carpet. Read my review of the Combo j7 to see how it works.

The Combo j9 adds a new mopping feature (also coming to the j7) called SmartScrub that moves the robot back and forth while mopping to simulate scrubbing. SmartScrub combines with Dirt Detective to target rooms that are more likely to need it, like kitchens and entryways.

The Combo i5 Plus and j5 Plus robot vacuum and mops are up to 40 percent off right now. Images: iRobot

The Roomba Combo i5 Plus ($349, down from $549 at Amazon) and Combo j5 Plus ($499, down from $799.99) are iRobot’s new budget and midrange bots that can vacuum and mop. Both are on sale for almost 40 percent off this week.

Roomba Combo i5 Plus $ 349 $ 550 37 % off $ 349 $ 349 $ 550 37 % off The Roomba Combo i5 Plus is the company’s budget vacuum and mop robot, but it still comes with an auto emptying dock and room mapping features. $349 at Amazon

Roomba Combo j5 Plus $ 499 $ 800 38 % off $ 499 $ 499 $ 800 38 % off The Combo j5 Plus is Roomba’s mid-range robot vacuum and mop combination device. It features and auto emptying dock and swappable modules for vacuuming or mopping. $499 at Amazon

I’ve not tested these new bots yet, but as an upgrade to my top budget pick, the Roomba i3 Evo (which is hard to find right now), the Combo i5 Plus adds a swappable mopping bin and a sleeker self-empty base. It has mapping but no keep-out zones, so it is best for hardwood floors — unlike the higher-end Combo models, it doesn't lift its mop up when it comes across carpet.

The new Roomba Combo j5 Plus is essentially the same robot but with more smarts. It allows for keep-out zones and no-mop zones and has the AI-powered obstacle avoidance of the j7 and j9 lines, so it will avoid common household clutter.

All the new models work with the iRobot app for scheduling and mapping and can be controlled by smart home platforms and voice assistants, including Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple’s Siri.
