Rachin Ravindra New Zealand's opening batsman Rachin Ravindra who played his first ODI World Cup delivered an entertaining show throughout the tournament. The 24-year-old smashed three centuries in the ICC World Cup 2023 and has registered 578 runs under his name. He is the first batsman to score three centuries in his maiden ODI World Cup and has also become the first Kiwi player to score three centuries in the ODI World Cup. Three centuries are the most for any batsman before turning 25 in the ICC ODI World Cup surpassing Sachin Tendulkar's two tons

The left-hander gave his all to guide Proteas to their first ODI World Cup title but all his efforts went in vain. In semi-final 2 of the ICC World Cup 2023, South Africa faced a defeat against Australia and was knocked out of the tournament. Despite the loss against the Aussies, Quinton smashed 594 runs including four centuries in the tournament

Virat Kohli India's stalwart batsman Virat Kohli is the leading run-scorer in the ICC World Cup 2023. He smashed 765 runs which is the most by any batter in a single ODI World Cup edition including three centuries. The veteran has consistently performed for the 'Men in Blue' throughout the tournament. Kohli also broke the record of the most number of ODI centuries and achieved his 50th ODI ton against New Zealand in the semi-final 1 of the ICC World Cup 2023

Mohammed Shami India's star speedster Mohammed Shami has incredibly contributed to his side with the ball. Shami missed out on the first few matches of the ICC World Cup 2023 but later played an impactful role in Team India's success. He ended his World Cup campaign with 24 wickets and is the leading wicket-taker in the tournament. Shami achieved his ODI-best bowling figures by clinching seven wickets for 57 runs against the Kiwis in the semi-final 1 of the ICC World Cup 2023 </textarea>
