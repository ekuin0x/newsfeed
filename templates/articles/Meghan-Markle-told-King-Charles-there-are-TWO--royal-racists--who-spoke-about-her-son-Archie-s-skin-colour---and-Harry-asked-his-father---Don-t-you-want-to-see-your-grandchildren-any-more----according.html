                <textarea id="text" readonly> Meghan Markle accused two people in the Royal Household of airing 'concerns' about her son Archie's skin colour, according to a bombshell new book set for release next week.

Omid Scobie's new volume Endgame claims the Duchess of Sussex wrote to King Charles III to outline her concerns in what threatens to reignite the 'royal racist' row that broke out in the wake of the Sussexes' interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021.

According to The Sun, the book will also feature claims that Harry made a cutting remark to his father as they rowed over Frogmore Cottage, allegedly asking the King: 'Don't you want to see your grandchildren anymore?'

French magazine Paris Match has also claimed the upcoming tome reveals a message was circulated in the Royal Family telling them not to trust Harry after his memoir Spare was released.

The journal claims that a source close to the King even allegedly said 'Charles was cautious' after Prince Harry called his father to pass on his best wishes three weeks after the book was published.

'He wanted to limit their discussion to a harmless exchange. Concerning Harry, the message that circulated in the family was not to trust him...everyone took it very seriously,' the source alleged.

The new book alleges that Harry tried to use his grandchildren as leverage with his father, King Charles III, in a bid to hold onto the keys for Frogmore Cottage in Windsor

Mr Scobie has denied his new book Endgame is 'Harry and Meghan's' and instead claimed it will tell the 'current state of the British Royal Family'

The book threatens to re-open old wounds between Harry and Meghan and the rest of the Royal Family

Members of the Royal Family were reportedly told not to trust Harry after his memoir, Spare, was published earlier this year

Scobie has urged people to read the book in full for the 'full and accurate story' when it releases on Tuesday

Scobie has lobbed a series of truth bombs at the Royal Family in the run-up to the release of Endgame next Tuesday, including the claim Meghan Markle does not want to return to England because she refuses 'to dive back into the soap opera'.

But the latest serialisations of the volume ahead of its release detail some of the most explosive allegations yet - including the potential reignition of the 'royal racist' row that came about after Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021.

Meghan had claimed in the TV special that an unnamed member of the Royal Family spoke about 'how dark his (Archie's) skin might be when he's born'.

The Sun reports, however, that a second member of the extended Royal Household - who may not be a member of the Royal Family itself - also made similar comments.

The two people are not named in Scobie's new book, which is subtitled Inside the Royal Family and the Monarchy's Fight for Survival.

Scobie reportedly claims to know who they are, but cannot name them for fear of legal reprisals in the UK.

He has also urged people to read the book for themselves when it releases on Tuesday in order to learn the 'full and accurate story'.

He wrote on X, formerly Twitter: 'Whether you like my work or loathe it, all I ask is that if you are reading coverage about what’s supposedly inside #ENDGAME, please also read the book itself.'

Further extracts from Endgame also suggest Harry made a cutting remark to King Charles III about his grandchildren as they argued over Frogmore Cottage in Windsor.

They were handed an eviction notice days after Harry's memoir Spare was published in January this year; extracts from Endgame claim the prince tried to use grandchildren Archie and Lilibet as leverage.

Harry is said to have asked his father: 'Don't you want to see your grandchildren?' as they argued over the future of the Royal residence.

However, the book also suggests Harry could be ready for reconciliation with his family, with the prince reported to have said: 'I'm ready to forget. Get an apology or explanation? At this point, who cares, right?'

But the Sussexes' cheerleader also launches several new attacks on senior royals including King Charles, who he claims ignored a meeting request from his son while he was in London earlier this year.

And in a dig against the Princess of Wales, Mr Scobie quotes a close friend of the Sussexes as saying she 'spent more time talking about Meghan... than with Meghan'.

Endgame, which is out on Tuesday, threatens to reopen old wounds in the aftermath of Megxit. It will brand Charles 'unpopular', William 'power hungry' and say Harry was 'betrayed by his own family'.

On Friday, Buckingham Palace told MailOnline it was 'not commenting' on the latest extracts published by Paris Match, nor claims Mr Scobie made in an accompanying interview with the publication. MailOnline has contacted Archewell for comment.

In extracts of Endgame shared with Paris Match, Mr Scobie also claims...

Meghan decided against attending King Charles' coronation because she did not want to 'dive back into the soap opera of the court';

Despite this, she and Harry still keep him 'up to date' by 'sending him photos of their children';

Harry told his father 'don't you want to see your grandchildren anymore?' after Charles evicted him from Frogmore Cottage;

Charles told members of the Royal Family not to trust Harry following the publication of Spare.

The latest extracts from Endgame paint a dire picture of relations between Prince Harry and his family.

Omid Scobie also claims the Sussexes sent Christmas gifts to the Prince and Princess of Wales for their children but never received a thank you text in return

In interviews, the Duke of Sussex has previously held out hopes that they may one day come round to his view, but Mr Scobie claims he has now given up hope.

Instead, he quotes him as saying: 'I'm ready to forget. Get an apology or explanation? At this point, who cares, right?'

Meghan's decision not to attend the coronation on May 6 is one of the subjects covered in Endgame.

At the time, Harry announced he would be travelling to the UK without his wife, who was remaining in California to look after their children.

The Prince was reported to have voiced concerns over security and the reputation his family could receive from the public.

Other reports suggested Meghan had been left upset after a letter from Charles did not address claims she had made about her poor mental health.

At the time, Mr Scobie said Archie's birthday 'played a factor in the decision' and he expected it would be a 'fairly quick trip to the UK' for Harry.

But he's now claimed Endgame that Meghan didn't attend because she refused to 'dive back into the soap opera of the court'.

Mr Scobie has previously denied his new book is 'Harry and Meghan's' and instead claimed it will tell the 'current state of the British Royal Family'.

It comes hours after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex distanced themselves from the book, with insiders indicating to MailOnline they had nothing to do with it.

Posting on X last Thursday Mr Scobie wrote: 'And let's get this nonsense out the way - #ENDGAME is about the current state of the British Royal Family.

'It's not ''Harry and Meghan's book'', I'm not ''Meg's pal'', the Sussexes have nothing to do with it, their story is a small part of a much bigger one you can read in 12 days.'

Experts said that the Sussexes' favoured royal reporter's new biography is threatening a potential thawing in relations between the King and his youngest son.

Reactions to the post from social media users varied, with one person writing: 'Oh, so not like the last book then.'

Another person wrote: 'Preach! Set them straight.'

MailOnline understands that Meghan and Harry categorically deny any suggestion they are 'affiliated' with the book or that Mr Scobie, who has been friendly with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and co-wrote their biography Finding Freedom, is part of the 'Sussex Camp'.

The denial came after Harry and Meghan's olive branch to the King on his 75th birthday.

Harry is believed to have telephoned his father last Tuesday - and they have reportedly agreed to chat again this week.

The Duchess of Sussex is also said to have spoken to her father-in-law from their home in California while the couple's children Archie, four, and Lilibet, two, recorded a video of themselves singing happy birthday to their grandfather.

Some 24 hours later, excerpts of Mr Scobie's book were shared with People in the US, including claims that Harry 'remained in the dark' about the Queen's health in her final moments.

It also alleges that it was Meghan who urged Harry to answer his phone when Charles called him on an 'unknown number' to reveal that the Queen was close to death, before also asking that Meghan should stay away from Balmoral.

Mr Scobie writes, 'Charles had cited 'protocol,' but the reality was that Kate chose to stay back to pick up the children from their first day at a new school.

'They just didn't want Meghan there,' said a former Palace aide. Meghan, a friend added, 'could sense she wasn't wanted.'

The book also claims Prince William ignored Harry's texts, forcing him to charter his own plane. 'William clearly didn't want to see his brother', Endgame says.

Mr Scobie's decision to piggyback the release of his new book on the King's 75th birthday and the sixth and final series of The Crown was branded 'deplorable'.

Royal journalist and author Phil Dampier told MailOnline: 'We all know that Scobie is their mouthpiece and he gets his information directly or indirectly from the Sussexes, so anything which is hurtful to Charles, Camilla or William and Kate, will just make things much worse. Let's put it this way - I can't see Harry and Meghan coming over for a family Christmas'.

He added: 'The King has always left the door open for his son and will continue to do so. But in reality if there are more serious allegations in Scobie's book it will set back any chance of a reconciliation'.

Royal courtiers are said to be furious over the claims made by Mr Scobie, who alleges that Prince William ignored the Duke of Sussex's calls as he raced to be at the Queen's bedside in Scotland in September last year.

Mr Scobie could be cut loose by the Sussexes and their circle, it has been claimed.

Mr Scobie claims that Prince William feels that he has 'lost Harry and doesn't want to know this version of him'

Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams said: 'The timing of this is utterly deplorable. I think the Sussexes will have to think hard about whether or not Scobie is their spokesman or their friend. It will be interesting to see if Harry and Meghan will still want to be associated with Scobie after this'.

He added: 'Of course, the fact that it's been leaked to People magazine makes one wonder what's been going on behind the scenes'.

Royal insiders have torn into Mr Scobie's claims that Prince William ignored his brother's calls as the late Queen lay dying in Balmoral last year.

They are said to be furious over the claims made by Harry and Meghan's biographer Omid Scobie, who alleges that the Prince of Wales ignored the Duke of Sussex's calls as he raced to be at the Queen's bedside in Scotland in September last year.

A Royal insider told the Mirror: 'It appears no matter what happens behind closed doors, even in a time of such pain and grief, that where the Royal Family are concerned it will one day emerge.

'Nothing is off limits with William and Kate appearing to be this author's number one target. It only takes a few months for the knives to come out again and the wounds to be opened up'.

In an excerpt of his latest book, Endgame, Mr Scobie alleges that Prince Harry was 'kept in the dark' about the Queen's health in the hours before she died, and that Prince William feels that he has 'lost Harry and doesn't want to know this version of him'.

Mr Scobie said Harry, 39, and his 42-year-old wife Meghan had 'no idea' the Royal Family were preparing for the Queen's death last year.

According to the Mirror, Mr Scobie has said there was 'no proof' King Charles called his youngest son during the Queen's death

In Endgame, Mr Scobie recounts how the Sussexes had visited the UK for a series of engagements in September 2022 when the palace announced that Queen Elizabeth had been advised by her doctors to rest.

He writes: 'By the next morning, the Sussexes had no idea that Buckingham Palace was already planning for the Queen's final hours and the first days of the monarchy's new era — until the duke's phone started ringing. An unknown number. He usually ignored those.'

Meghan told her husband to pick up the phone and he accepted the call 'just before it stopped', the author wrote.

He continues: 'Harry hadn't spoken to his father much that year, but this was not the time for any father-and-son tension. Charles told him he and Camilla were about to leave Dumfries House for Balmoral, where Princess Anne was already by the Queen's side. He told Harry to make his way to Scotland immediately.'

Harry sent a text message to his brother William asking how he and Kate planned to Scotland and whether they could travel together but got no response, Mr Scobie claims.

He was later told Harry had managed to secure a flight with his uncles Prince Andrew and Prince Edward.

'It was upsetting to witness,' Mr Scobie claims he was told by a source close to the Sussexes. '[Harry] was completely by himself on this.'

Mr Scobie alleges that Palace 'sources' briefed certain newspapers that Charles had personally shared the news of the Queen's illness with his son. He quoted a friend of the duke who said this left Harry 'crushed'.

The author also suggests William and Harry's relationship is beyond repair because the Prince of Wales sees his brother as a 'defector'.

And in the extract shared with People, he claims 'there is no going back' for the brothers and 'absolutely nothing has changed' since the Duke of Sussex released Spare earlier this year.

A spokesman for Buckingham Palace refused to comment on Endgame, due to be released on November 28, when approached by MailOnline.

The latest bombshell accusations come just hours after Harry ad his father shared 'cordial' 75th birthday call.

Harry is believed to have phoned his father on his special day yesterday to wish him Happy Birthday - in a call thought to be the estranged royals' first phone chat in six months.

King Charles and Harry are understood to have had minimal contact for months, particularly since the release of Harry's tell-all memoir Spare, published in January, and a Netflix series, which was released the month prior to that.

Meghan is also said to have spoken to her father-in-law to pass on her wishes from California. And the couple's children Archie and Lilibet recorded a video of themselves singing happy birthday to their grandfather, the Telegraph newspaper reported.

The report claimed Charles and Harry will speak again next week after their call marked a 'shift' in tone and a 'turning point' between the pair.

Harry and Meghan previously said they had 'no contact' from Buckingham Palace about an invitation to Charles' 75th evening birthday event.

The Sunday Times reported that Prince Harry had turned down an invitation to the birthday bash.

But a source close to the Sussexes told MailOnline they were not invited to Charles's party.

'They had not received any invitation and were unaware of any celebrations until the stories came out,' the insider previously said, adding: 'I'm sure the Duke will find a way to reach out privately to wish His Majesty a happy birthday like he has always done'.

Buckingham Palace previously refused to discuss the King's plans.

The Palace refused to comment on reports the father and son spoke for the King's birthday and are due to speak again next week when contacted by MailOnline.

Meanwhile the Prince and Princess of Wales were seen enjoying a late night out as they departed Clarence House close to midnight after King Charles's glittering 75th birthday party last night.

They were joined at the monarch's birthday celebration by his niece Princess Beatrice, Princess Margaret's daughter Lady Sarah Chatto and Princess Anne's daughter Zara Tindall and her husband Mike Tindall.

Lady Susan Hussey, 84, the former lady-in-waiting to the late Queen Elizabeth II, was also in attendance, sporting an elegant blue shimmering gown, while Jools Holland also made an appearance.

Other family members attending Charles' birthday event also included the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, and David Armstrong-Jones, the 2nd Earl of Snowdon, the son of the late Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones. </textarea>
