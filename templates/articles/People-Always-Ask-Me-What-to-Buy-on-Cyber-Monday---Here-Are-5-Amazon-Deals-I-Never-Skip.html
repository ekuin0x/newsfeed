                <textarea id="text" readonly> Some people exclusively like to shop Black Friday deals, while others prefer to see how low prices will go once Cyber Monday comes around. I’m a firm believer that both sales are worth shopping — you just need to know what to get for each. When it comes to Cyber Monday at Amazon, I’m all about getting the essentials; aka, restock that shampoo you love, grab those cozy boots for the incoming temperature drop, and, well, you might as well do some holiday shopping for less along the way.

Below are the five Cyber Monday deals I’m adding to my Amazon cart, starting at just $13:

Fireside by Dearfoams Shearling Lined Mini Ankle Boot

Amazon

Cozy mini boots are everywhere this season, so I can’t resist adding these comfy ankle boots from Dearfoams to my cart. Not only are they a whopping 50 percent off, but they feature everything you could want in a warm winter boot, from a shearling lining to a durable indoor/outdoor sole. They’re available in classic black and chestnut shades, as well as a fun camo and metallic gold. “[They’re] so comfortable, easy to slip on, and don’t make your feet sweat!” one shopper raved, adding that they’re “already [getting] tons of compliments on them and people asking where I got them.”

Cosrx Retinol 0.1% Cream

Amazon

If you ask me, this is one of the best skincare deals on Amazon right now. Just $13 right now, this gentle but potent retinol hails from customer-loved Korean beauty brand Cosrx — which is behind many best-sellers like the Snail Mucin Essence and its moisturizer counterpart. Also formulated with nourishing vitamin E and panthenol, a moisturizing agent that can repair the skin barrier, the retinol cream tackles everything from fine lines to acne without irritating your skin. Just take it from this shopper, who said they’re “blown away” by how good their skin looks “in just a short amount of time.” “[I] started this two weeks ago and I have smoother skin, a brighter complexion, and zero breakouts,” they claimed.

Philips Sonicare 4100 Electric Toothbrush

Amazon

I don’t know about you, but I find high-end electric toothbrushes a little intimidating. I mean, do I really need a $200 toothbrush? I’m not so sure, which is why I’m eyeing this popular Philips Sonicare brush while it’s just $30. The simple electric toothbrush has two intensity settings (low and high), a built-in two-minute timer, and a long battery life that can last up to two weeks before another charge. I’m pretty sold on those features alone, but the 22,000 five-star ratings are pretty convincing, too. “It is easy to use with excellent results! My dentist and the dental hygienist have bragged [about] my dental health since I've been using this Sonicare 4100 the last four years,” one customer said.

The Gym People High-Waist Yoga Leggings With Pockets

Amazon

I’ve been trying out a lot of activewear brands on Amazon recently, and The Gym People is next on my list. After success with other labels like Crz Yoga and Automet, I have faith that I’ll be satisfied with these high-waisted leggings that more than 43,000 Amazon shoppers love. The comfy leggings come in tons of colors and both full-length and cropped options. Complete with a wide waistband and side pockets, shoppers love that the leggings “don’t roll at the waist,” even after a five-mile run, and are made with a thicker, “more substantial” fabric. They’re a total steal at just $20 right now.

Nexxus Color Assure Sulfate-Free Shampoo

Amazon

I recently dyed my hair with a deep violet red gloss, so I switched my shampoo to upkeep the color. I tried Nexxus’ Color Assure shampoo for the first time and I’m in love with it. Since I have oily strands, I usually have a hard time trying out new haircare products as they tend to leave my hair greasy and flat. But this shampoo actually leaves me with voluminous strands that don’t get oily by the next day — all while protecting my new hair color. The 33-ounce bottle is just $18 right now, so I may just add two to my cart. </textarea>
