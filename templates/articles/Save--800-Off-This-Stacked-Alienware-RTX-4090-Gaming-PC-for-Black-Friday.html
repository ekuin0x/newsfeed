                <textarea id="text" readonly> As part of its Dell Black Friday Sale event, Dell is offering this Alienware Aurora R15 RTX 4090 gaming PC for $3099.99, a savings of $800. In addition to the most powerful GPU on the market, this PC is also equipped with one of AMD's most powerful consumer CPUs as well as copious amounts of RAM and storage. This is the least expensive Alienware RTX 4090 gaming PC listed on Dell's site right now. It's still not cheap, but then again no RTX 4090 gaming PC is.

$800 Off the Alienware Aurora RTX 4090 Gaming PC

Alienware Aurora R15 Cryo-Tech Liquid Cooled AMD Ryzen 9 7950X RTX 4090 Gaming PC with 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD 21% off $3,899.99 0 $3,099.99 See on Dell

The specs on this Alienware Aurora R15 config include an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X CPU, RTX 4090 GPU, 32GB of DDR-4800MHz RAM, and a 2TB NVME SSD. The Ryzen 9 7950X features a boost clock speed of 5.7GHz with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 80MB of total cache. This is still AMD's best general purpose CPU, excelling at gaming, 3D rendering, multi-tasking, and pretty much anything else you can throw at it. It's cooled by Alienware's "Cryo-Tech" liquid cooling, which is Dell's highest-end 240mm all-in-one cooling.

The RTX 4090 is far and away the most powerful video card you can get right now, leaving competitors like AMD's latest Radeon RX 7900 XTX in the dust. It's also ridiculously more powerful than any of the RTX 30 series cards: for example, it's up to 90% faster than the 3080 Ti. The 4090 is the best card for ray-traced 4K gaming at consistent 60+fps performance in any game currently released. It doesn't look like a better card will come out for quite a while. If you're still not convinced, check out our RTX 4090 review.
