One of social media's seemingly favorite hair styling tools is down to a record low for Black Friday. Dyson's Airwrap has a list price of $600 but is now on sale for $480 at QVC and for the same price on Amazon, after you clip the on-page coupon. The innovative AirWrap relies on air instead of extreme heat to dry and shape hair — which could help keep your hair healthier over using a curling iron, straightener or blow dryer.

The Dyson Airwrap uses a technology called the Coanda effect, a phenomenon describing airflow’s tendency to follow the path of a curved surface. Here, the air jet flows around the tool’s barrel or brush attachment, so it wraps, dries and styles hair all at once. Since it doesn't use a lot of heat, it's meant to be less damaging to your hair in the long run. Dyson claims the Airwrap monitors the device multiple times per second, ensuring the temp stays safe for your hair.

It comes with a rotating cool tip, three airflow speeds, three heat settings and a cold shot feature that immediately turns off the heating element, helping to set your with a blast of cool air. And there are plenty of accessories too: A barrel that's 1.2 inches around, a barrel 1.6 inches in diameter, two smoothing brushes, a smoothing dryer, a volumizing brush and a detangling comb. Plus there's a filter cleaner and a case to neatly store everything.

Considering the attention this item has been getting — and the fact that it's been a fast-selling gift for the holidays — means it may go out of stock quickly. If you've got your eye on it, either for your own hair or someone else's, you may want to snap it up.
