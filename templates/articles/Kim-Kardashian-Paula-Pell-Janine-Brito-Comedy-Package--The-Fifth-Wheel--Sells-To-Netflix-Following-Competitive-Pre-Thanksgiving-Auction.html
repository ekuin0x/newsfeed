                <textarea id="text" readonly> EXCLUSIVE: Following a nearly week long competitive bidding war that saw five bids from various suitors that included theatrical distributors and streamers, the comedy package The Fifth Wheel starring Kim Kardashian has sold to Netflix. In recent days the number of bids got cut from five to three with Netflix finally giving the winning offer right after Thanksgiving that won over Kardashian and co-writers Paula Pell and Janine Brito.

Pell will produce with Kardashian. Sources tell Deadline Kardashian has been very hands on in the process to sell the female-driven comedy, appearing at each meeting to deliver the pitch and the studios are lining up to get in business with Kardashian.

Logline is under wraps but Kardashian will play the eponymous “fifth wheel” alongside a female ensemble cast.

What is so unique about how this package came together, was the speed of where in many cases it takes months this was days starting with Pell and Brito coming up with the idea and then pitching Kardashian almost immediately after the strike ended. Within days the package would hit the market and now has become the first major sale before 2023 comes to an end.

With Kardashian also being a producer sources say there is a real marketing aspect to the deal where she will be very hands on with that element and that would also include her branding and ad agency playing a part alongside Netflix. Whether it be her fashion line, SKIMS, or her other projects, Kardashian has shown her ability to get the most out of any product she is involved and that is the hope with this project as well.

​The package was picked up by Niija Kuykendall’s mid-budget film team at Netflix. Some of the upcoming mid-budget films on that slate includes the rom com A Family Affair starring Nicole Kidman, Zac Efron and Joey King, the romance Lonely Planet starring Laura Dern and Liam Hemsworth, Dan Levy’s directorial debut Good Grief in which he stars alongside Ruth Negga, Himesh Patel and Luke Evans and Tyler Perry’s Six Triple Eight starring Kerry Washington.

Deadline first reported over the weekend that this package was heating up the market pre-thanksgiving and is the first major sale coming out of the SAG-AFTRA strike being settled earlier this month. There was a wonder following both the SAG and WGA strikes whether the market would still see auctions with so many suitors but this bidding war clearly shows these type of bidding wars are alive and well as the end of the year approaches.

Kardashian has done limited work as an actress, including lending her voice to two Paw Patrol films. She stepped it up with a scene stealing role in the most recent season of FX’s American Horror Story. Her role as a publicist earned her strong notices. Now, she’s looking to build off that and jump into the feature film realm. She also still has her hit Hulu series The Kardashians.

Pell is the Saturday Night Live vet who went on to work with Tina Fey on 30 Rock, and also with Amy Poehler and Judd Apatow. She also penned the comedy Sisters starring Fey and Poehler. Brito’s getting her first major screenplay after acting in Wine Country, which Pell also acted in.

Britto’s other credits include the critically acclaimed series GIRLS5Eva, which will have its third season premiere on Netflix next year (which Pell will also appear in) and she was also a writer on NBC’s Mr. Mayor.

Kardashian, Pell and Brito are all repped by WME. Kardashian is also repped by Cooley LLP and Pell is also repped by Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman, Newman, Warren, Richman, Rush, Kaller & Gellman, LLP and Brito is also repped by. Cohen & Gardner. </textarea>
