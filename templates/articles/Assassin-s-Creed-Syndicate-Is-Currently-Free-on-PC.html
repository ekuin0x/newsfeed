                <textarea id="text" readonly> Assassin's Creed Syndicate is currently free on PC as part of a special offer available to anyone with a Ubisoft account.

The 2015 title is currently part of an "exclusive giveaway" on Ubisoft's website that lets players pick up the Victorian London-set Assassin's Creed for nothing. The offer is available until December 6.

There are some very slight caveats in that players must have the aforementioned Ubisoft account and use the Ubisoft Connect launcher to access it instead of Steam or the Epic Games Store, but Assassin's Creed Syndicate is otherwise genuinely free.

IGN's Twenty Questions - Guess the game! Welcome to 20 questions. Can you guess the game?

Taking on the role of twin protagonists Evie and Jacob Frye living in 1868 London, players must rally and lead the underworld to break the corrupt stranglehold on the capital in a game filled with as much brutal combat as traditional Assassin's Creed gameplay.

It earned an 8/10 in IGN's review. "Assassin's Creed Syndicate pushes its thick lore into the background and delivers the most fun and focussed Assassin's game in a while," we said at the time.

The series has since moved on from the action adventure style gameplay present in Assassin's Creed Syndicate, first with the role-playing game entries Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, and most recently with Mirage which returned the series to its smaller scale, stealth-based roots.
