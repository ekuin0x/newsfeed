                <textarea id="text" readonly> Ibrahim Zadran scored a hundred against Australia at the Wankhede Stadium in the ICC World Cup 2023. He managed 129 runs off 143 deliveries, with the help of 8 fours and 3 sixes. Afghanistan posted 291/8 in 50 overs.

The sub-continent team reduced the Aussies to 91/7, but Glenn Maxwell’s double hundred took his team to a three-wicket win.

Afghanistan defeated England, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Netherlands in the World Cup. Their win over the Babar Azam-led team was memorable one for some of the Afghan players.

Ibrahim was named the Player of the Match for scoring 87 runs off 117 balls while chasing 283 in Chennai.

Afghanistan won the game by 8 wickets, with Rahmanullah Gurbaz (65), Rahmat Shah (77 not out) and Hashmatullah Shahidi (48 not out) valuable knocks.

Remembering his team’s win against Pakistan, Zadran took to X and wrote:

“October 23rd 2023 will always be special in my heart. Never felt energetic like that in a cricket game before.What a blessed evening that was.”

He copied Virat Kohli’s tweet, which the star India batter had written to celebrate the Men in Blue’s win over Pakistan in the T20 World Cup 2022. The game was played on October 23 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and Kohli was named the Player of the Match for scoring an unbeaten 82 runs off 53 balls in India’s win by 4 wickets.

Ibrahim was trolled by fans for his copying act. Here are some of the reactions.

Nahhh mannn 😭😭
