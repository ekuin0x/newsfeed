                <textarea id="text" readonly> Pakistan fast-bowler Naseem Shah has said that he realized that he had to get the job done against Afghanistan when all-rounder Shadab Khan was dismissed. Pakistan beat Afghanistan in a last-over thriller by one wicket to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match ODI series in Hambantota, Sri Lanka.

Speaking in a video posted by Pakistan Cricket, Shah said he backed himself to get the job done after Shadab lost his wicket in the final over. With 11 runs needed off the last over, Afghanistan pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi removed Shadab’s bails in his bowling run-up after he saw the all-rounder leaving his crease from the non-striker's end.

“I hope I don't get any heart attacks while playing such knocks towards the end (laughs). When I walked into bat, Shadab had faith that we could finish the game. But when Shadab was dismissed, I realized it was up to me to get the job done. The bowler was the same, the situation was the same and I backed myself to take my team over the line,” said Shah.

He went on to say that he had belief in himself that he could get Pakistan over the line in the final over of the second ODI against Pakistan. Shah hit Farooqi for two boundaries in the final over to guide Pakistan to a narrow one-wicket win.

“I had the belief that I could do it. I also practice in the nets knowing that my batting is likely to come in such breathtaking situations. It is difficult to remain calm in such situations, but I just try and focus on what I can do in that situation and keep things simple, focus on my work, and leave the rest to God,” Shah added.

With this win, Pakistan took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match ODI series, while also keeping their six-match winning streak against Afghanistan intact. </textarea>
