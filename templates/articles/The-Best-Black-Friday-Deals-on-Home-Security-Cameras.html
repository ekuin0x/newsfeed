If you want to double-check the garage is closed, get an alert when packages are left at your door, or even see what local wildlife is visiting your backyard, you’re going to need a security camera. We’ve rounded up the best deals from across the internet for Black Friday so you can rest assured you’re getting the best deal, no matter what brand you invest in.

Amazon

It’s no surprise that Blink dominates the deals at Amazon today. Their native line of security cameras got a great review from us for their new Outdoor 4 series. Whether you’re grabbing indoor or outdoor cameras, don’t miss the savings when you pick up a bundle.

Target

If you’re rocking Android or Google Home, then investing in Nest makes total sense. Their wired and battery-operated cameras look good while integrating seamlessly into your home automation.

Walmart

This was the widest range of brands on sale today, with a lot of deals on eufy. While eufy weathered a security issue last year, they’re still one of my favorites for their unmatched video quality. I am particularly fond of the Floodlight camera, which has two different lenses: a micro and a macro, so you can really zero in on what you’re looking at.

Home Depot

Home Depot is all in on Ring cameras, the granddaddy of connected doorbells. They now have an entire ecosystem of cameras and security products that all tie into the same subscription for your doorbell. If you’ve already got a Ring cam for your door, there’s a great argument to stick with the brand.

Lowe’s

Arlo is a lesser known but well-reviewed brand in the smart camera space, and their models tend to be more affordable. Even so, there are a few deals worth looking at here. If you’ve been hesitant to spend the money on a smart security system, Arlo is a good choice to dip your toes in the water.

Best Buy

Best Buy has great deals on eufy, Ring, and Arlo, but don’t miss out on a little gem in the Chamberlain video keypad for your garage door. </textarea>
