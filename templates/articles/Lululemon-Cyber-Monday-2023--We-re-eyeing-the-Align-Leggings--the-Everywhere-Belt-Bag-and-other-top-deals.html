                <textarea id="text" readonly> You've likely had your eye on tons of the most popular Lululemon pieces the brand offers, and you know it's hard to get your hands on them even when they're listed for full price. Well, now's your chance. With all the Cyber Monday 2023 deals happening today, the frenzy has only increased. Luckily, tons of items are marked down and the prices are absolutely unbeatable. That said, it's time to pounce — because this stuff sells out fast!

Famous for its ridiculously durable and fabulously stylish leggings, the brand rarely marks down its goods. Well, consider today your lucky day. Lululemon's Cyber Monday sale is better than we could have imagined. Some leggings are down to just $39 (from $118). The popular Everywhere Belt Bag is also on sale.

Want to get even luckier — as in getting early access to new-product drops? Get yourself a Lululemon Membership — it's free. Enough chitchat; it's time to shop! Check out the discounted pieces we're eyeing or shop the entire sale here. While items vary by color and size, the prices shown below are the lowest starting price. But you'll have to be quick — there's no telling how long these Cyber Monday deals will last as certain options are already selling out.
