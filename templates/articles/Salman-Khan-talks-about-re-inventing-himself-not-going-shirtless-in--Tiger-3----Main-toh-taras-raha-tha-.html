                <textarea id="text" readonly> Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif starrer ' Tiger 3 ' has proved to be the biggest Diwali hit of all times. The film has managed to make Rs 427 crores gross worldwide and has continued its glorious run. Salman has seamlessly gotten into the mould of his character this time around after the first two parts - ' Ek Tha Tiger (2012) and ' Tiger Zinda Hai (2017).Yet many of his fans felt that he's re-invented himself this time around while keeping the essence of Tiger intact.During an interview, when we asked Salman that, here's how we responded. "It's like me doing Chulbul Pandey , where we've done part one and three. Hence, Chulbul is a part of my mannerisms now sometimes. When the character has just grown, the part three looks better because of the experience of part 1 and 2, without me doing anything. Which is why, I think, fans think Tiger is better this time around."But fans eagerly await for Khan to go shirtless in every film and that's what they always wait for. This time around, fans are disappointed as they missed a chance to see Khan bare chested. Ask him about it and he says, "Iss baar mauka nahi mila. Main toh taras raha tha ke ek aisa dedo shot jahan shirt nikle. (This time the opportunity didn't arise. I was really excited and waiting to remove my shirt! Alas!)"Salman is elated with the film's success though and feels that script wise, 'Tiger 3' is the best of all the three movies of the franchise. 'Tiger 3' directed by Maneesh Sharma, also starred Emraan Hashmi. </textarea>
