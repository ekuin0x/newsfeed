Main U.S. indexes were mixed on Monday ahead of the release of important inflation data this week. Retailers were on investors minds as holiday shopping picked up steam.

Here are some of the biggest U.S. stock movers today:

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 1.5% after the online retail giant reached an agreement with most of its workers in Spain on Monday, avoiding the full impact of a planned one-hour strike per shift on one of the busiest online shopping days of the year.

Walmart (NYSE: ) stock rose 0.6% as Cyber Monday follows on from Black Friday, with this retail giant hoping to benefit from the largesse of shoppers.

Shopify (NYSE: ) stock rose 5% after the e-commerce group said its merchants had posted an all-time high of $4.1 billion in combined sales on Black Friday.

Crown Castle (NYSE: ) stock rose 4.1% following a report in the Wall Street Journal that activist investor Elliott Investment Management aims to advocate for changes at the wireless tower owner.

Novo Nordisk (NYSE: ) stock fell 1.1% after the drugmaker’s CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen said, in a report in the Financial Times, that the company is ready to be "flexible" on pricing schemes for its Wegovy weight-loss drug as it attempts to make it more widely available.

GE HealthCare Technologies (NASDAQ: ) stock fell 3.8% after UBS downgraded the medical devices maker to ‘sell’ from ‘neutral’, citing a combination of slower order momentum, tough comparables and a lack of pricing tailwinds.

Roku (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 8% after Cannonball Research upgraded the streaming device maker to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’, expecting more significant upward revisions to the fiscal 2024 consensus.

YPF Sociedad Anonima (NYSE: ) stock rose 4.5% after Goldman Sachs upgraded the majority state-owned Argentine energy company to ‘neutral’ from ‘sell’, following the announcement by President-elect Javier Milei, who is set to take office on Dec 10, about his intention to privatize the company.

Teva Pharma (NYSE: ) ADRs rose 2.3% after UBS upgraded the Israeli pharmaceutical company to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’, saying it is in a unique position for a major shift towards becoming a more brand-focused company.

Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) shares rose 10.3%. Adobe (NASDAQ: ) said BNPL Cyber Monday spending was up 18.8% year-over-year to $782 million.
