                <textarea id="text" readonly> Turkish clubs Fenerbahce and Galatasaray are reportedly interested in signing Salih Özcan, but only a substantial offer would prompt Borussia Dortmund to sell him.

Salih Özcan has enjoyed quite the turnaround in his sophomore season with Borussia Dortmund, and has established himself as an important part of the team in midfield. The defensive midfielder’s strong performances have seen him attract the interest of Fenerbahce and Galatasaray, with reports in Turkey claiming that both clubs are preparing offers for him in January.

But Borussia Dortmund have no interest in selling Özcan, especially in the middle of the season. And BILD are claiming that it would take an exorbitant offer to change the mind of the BVB bosses.

Özcan, who joined Borussia Dortmund from FC Köln last year, has made a total of 47 appearances for the club. The 25 year old endured a difficult debut season with BVB and struggled to hold down a spot in the team. But he has enjoyed quite the resurgence this season, and has starred in defensive midfield amid Emre Can’s struggles with form and fitness.

Galatasaray also showed interest in signing Salih Özcan in the summer transfer window. But he turned down a move to Turkey in favour of staying at Borussia Dortmund.

Özcan has earned rave reviews for his performances so far this season, with his assured presence in defensive midfield leading to an uptick in results for BVB. And the Black and Yellows will hope that he can continue his fine run of form after the international break, with a number of crunch games coming up. </textarea>
