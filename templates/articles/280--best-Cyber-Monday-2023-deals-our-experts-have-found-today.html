The Cyber Monday deals are live, but we're deep into the final day to take advantage of the year's lowest prices on hundreds of items across multiple categories. The long weekend sales event always goes out with a bang, and we've seen big price drops on a fresh range of items today. And yes, there are plenty of Black Friday sales still happening. The clock is indeed ticking, though, as most of the deals on this page will expire at midnight.

We only recommend price drops that pass our rigorous price-checking process, on products from brands we've tested and trust. You can expect the low-down on why discounts are deals, how worthwhile they are, and whether or not they're worth buying.

After a decade of covering Cyber Monday sales, I certainly wouldn't wait too long to bite at this point if you have anything specific in mind. The big flagship deals will start selling out as many people wait until today to buy to ensure they're getting the best price, especially in tech and gaming. Fashion brands and home stores often have interesting Cyber Mondays, though, using it to clear out older lines before the new seasons begin, so we'd certainly keep your eyes on them. Better yet, let us do it.

Dive into our roundup of the best Cyber Monday deals below, and keep checking in with us as we update this guide throughout the remaining hours of the sale.
