                <textarea id="text" readonly> This Black Friday weekend is the best time to score amazing deals on holiday gifts, especially when it comes to home decor, small kitchen appliances, barware, and more.

Sales like this are always welcome ahead of the holidays because home gifts are usually so expensive. Ironically, that's why they're such good gifts; homeware like this is the chance to treat your loved ones to luxuries they'd never usually buy themselves.

I spent hours combing through the sales to find only the very best based on my expertise as a shopping writer and our expert tests. From Anthropologie’s Black Friday sale to Amazon’s weekend deals, there are plenty of savings to be had on the best home gifts.

The Best Candle Gifts

You can’t go wrong with a candle gift, and Boy Smells, Hotel Collection, Voluspa, and more are on major sale this weekend. From luxe-worthy aromas to budget-friendly gift sets, this is the best weekend to stock up on candles for your friends, co-workers, and family.

The Best Home Textie Gifts

With Black Friday sales at Anthropologie, Amazon, and more, this weekend is one of the best times to shop for home decor gifts. From throw pillows and blankets to decorative candle warmer lamps and vases, you can find all sorts of amazing finds with even better deals all weekend long.

The Best Kitchen Gifts

Whether you’re looking for stocking stuffer ideas or want to gift some high-tech kitchen gadgets, Black Friday weekend has you covered with sales on everything from Brightland olive oil to the Meater smart meat thermometer.

The Best Bar Gifts

If you have a designated cocktail maker in your family, this is the best weekend to find deals on bar gifts to give this holiday season. Whether you want to refresh their wine glasses or give the gift of a splurge-worthy bar cart, you can find all sorts of gift ideas on sale this Black Friday weekend.

The Best Appliance Gifts

Appliances are on major sale this weekend, making it the best time to purchase large gifts for the cooks in your life (or for yourself!). From the coveted Ooni Pizza Oven to the Almond Cow nut milk maker, there’s a small appliance for everyone.

Black Friday FAQs?

When is Black Friday over? Black Friday ended midnight 11/24. However, most deals will be running until midnight 11/27, when Cyber Monday ends.

What can I buy on Cyber Monday? Cyber Monday tends to see big discounts on computers and smart tech like phones. However, if retailers haven't sold enough stock you may see big discounts on appliances, too.

Final thought

However, you don't have to sort out all your gift buying right now. There's also Black Friday savings on everyday essentials like sheets and air fryers, too. </textarea>
