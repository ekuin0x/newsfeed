                <textarea id="text" readonly> The best early Cyber Monday deals on Beats headphones: BEST HEADPHONE DEAL Beats Solo3 $119.99 at Target (save $79.96) Get Deal BEST EARBUD DEAL Beats Fit Pro $149.99 at Verizon (save $50) Get Deal

Whether you've had your eye on a pair of headphones all year or you're looking to check off your holiday shopping list, it's officially the best time of year to snag a pair from brands like Beats.

Under the same Apple umbrella as AirPods, we also have Beats — which are arguably the better headphones in comparison. While the Beats deals are off to a slower start this season than their Apple relatives, things are starting to heat up. We're definitely expecting to see some bigger price drops as we inch closer to the big day. Nevertheless, some early Beats deals are still worth your time and money. We've rounded up the best early Cyber Monday deals on Beats headphones and earbuds below and will be updating it regularly with all the latest price drops.

Cyber Monday Beats headphone deals

Why we like it

While Verizon isn't our first choice of retailer for Black Friday deals, it happens to have the Beats Fit Pro for just $149.99 — which matches their lowest price to date — ahead of the official day. These buds feature elite audio quality, all-day comfort, long-lasting battery life (six hours with ANC turned on), and noise cancellation that'll surely impress — even in the hustle and bustle of the city streets. Mashable tech reporter Alex Perry called them the "best earbuds in Apple's portfolio, period." And that's saying something. While the buds were first released in 2021, the brand dropped three new colorways back in Feb. 2023; every shade is on sale for $50 off.

Check out our full review of the Beats Fit Pro.
