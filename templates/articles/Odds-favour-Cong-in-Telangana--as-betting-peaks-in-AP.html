                <textarea id="text" readonly> Hardly five days are left for the commencement of polling in the Telangana assembly elections and the betting gangs in Andhra Pradesh, particularly in East and West Godavari districts, are investing huge amounts on the parties with high stakes.

As reported earlier, cCrores of rupees are changing hands in Bhimavaram and Narsapuram areas on betting on Telangana elections. And with ground reports from Telangana indicating a fluid situation, the money being bet on the parties has also started fluctuating.

Till three weeks ago, the punters and betting rings were putting their money in favour of Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) led by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. They were under the impression that KCR would do a miracle and return to power for a third consecutive term, though the Congress is giving a tough fight.

But now with less than a week left for the polling, the Congress has become a hot favourite. Three weeks ago, it was 60:40 in favour of the BRS but now, it has come to 50:50, indicating that there is every possibility of a hung situation in the Telangana.

According to the latest predictions by the punters, both the Congress and the BRS have a chance to win 54-56 seats, where as the MIM will get 6-8 seats and the BJP will end up with 4-5 seats.

Apparently, the people betting on the Telangana elections are going in a very calculated way and the stakes are changing from district to district. As the polling day approaches fast, the stakes will change and who knows, those who bet on the Congress victory make big money. </textarea>
