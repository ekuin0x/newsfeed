                <textarea id="text" readonly> IRON MOUNTAIN — After the first half of play, the Iron Mountain football team found itself locked in a heated battle with West PAC Iron Division foe Ishpeming in the MHSAA Division 8 district final at Mountaineer Stadium on Friday night.

Then the Mountaineers exploded out of the locker room for the second half and left the Hematites in the dust en route to a 40-16 victory to claim the district crown.

“We made enough plays to get the job done, credit to our kids, it’s tough to win a district championship,” IM coach Robin Marttila said. “We made plays, Bradon Walstrom ran hard, got in the end zone a few times. Matthew Colavecchi, in the passing game he’s tough…. We were able to get the job done against a tough football team. Year in and year out, Ishpeming has tough kids and that’s a credit to what they do.”

Following the victory, Iron Mountain athletic director Brad Perry presented the Mountaineers with the district title trophy. It was a special moment for junior quarterback Ian Marttila.

“This is my first one that I’ve won, and I was actually on the team and able to play, so it feels really good,” Ian Marttila said. “I’m really proud of our team and how we played to win this.”

While there was jovial chatter floating throughout Mountaineer Stadium, the feeling was a bit different for senior lineman Connor Owens.

“It feels good, last game in Mountaineer Stadium for me, it’s kind of heavy, but we won and it’s a memory I’ll never forget,” Owens said.

Ishpeming’s goal was evident on the opening drive as it swarmed IM senior running back Luke Wolfe every time he touched the ball.

“Their team pursues the ball very well and No. 33 (Ishpeming’s Hunter Smith) is a really good football player on both sides of the ball,” Coach Marttila said. “We did what we needed to do.

“I think we had a really good balance with the passing game. We passed the ball effectively, (which) sort of loosened them up, because they put a number of guys in the box and it’s tough to get the running game going.”

The Mountaineers opened the scoring four minutes in when Ian Marttila found Colavecchi, a senior wide receiver who was standing all alone in the end zone. After a successful extra point, IM led 7-0.

“Ian (Marttila) made a great read on the first touchdown,” Coach Marttila said.

The Mountaineers added to their lead at the start of the second quarter as senior running back Walstrom took a handoff to the right side. He broke through the Hematites’ defense and scored a 17-yard TD. Another successful extra point put Iron Mountain ahead 14-0.

Down and looking for a spark, Ishpeming found it in the form of the senior Smith, who hauled in a 33-yard TD that pulled the Hematites within 14-8.

Ian Marttila threw an interception on the next Iron Mountain drive, but that didn’t deter the Mountaineers.

The next time IM had the ball, Ian Marttila connected with Colavecchi on a 50-yard TD to give the Mountaineers a 20-8 lead at half.

“Kind of a rocky start, if you ask me,” Owens said. “We got it done at the end of the day, but there is definitely room for improvement.”

Both offenses started the second half slowly, then the Hematites coughed the ball up and Owens landed on it for his second fumble recovery of the night.

“The turnover battle, Connor Owens is explosive to get in the backfield,” Coach Marttila said. “Football is all about turnovers. We won the turnover battle here tonight and it was a big part of it.”

Iron Mountain took advantage of the Ishpeming mistake to start the fourth quarter as Ian Marttila found junior wide receiver Oskar Kangas for a 10-yard TD as the lead grew to 26-8.

“They were a really good team, coming into the game we knew they were going to be tough and they weren’t going to stop, no matter what the score was,” Ian Marttila said. “We just had to come out, keep fighting and make plays. And that’s what we did.”

Wolfe and junior Alex Jayne scored rushing touchdowns in the fourth quarter as the Mountaineers took a 40-8 lead.

Ishpeming scored again with a minute remaining to make it a 40-16 game. However, it was too late and IM secured the district crown in victory formation.

The Mountaineers travel to face Beal City for the regional title on Friday night.

Ian Marttila led the Mountaineers offense, completing 10 of 19 passes for 203 yards and three TDs.

Wolfe led Iron Mountain’s defense with seven tackles. He also added an interception. </textarea>
