                <textarea id="text" readonly> Pelissero later reported that the Panthers also fired quarterbacks coach Josh McCown and assistant head coach/RBs Duce Staley. The decision to move on from McCown and Staley was made by Tabor and Caldwell, per Pelissero.

"There's a heart-pounding disappointment in not hitting the marks that we needed to hit to keep this going and try to get it turned around," Reich said in an interview with The Charlotte Observer on Monday. "It hurts me for the guys, the team, the coaches and the fans."

It's been a rough first season for Reich in Carolina as the Panthers showed little signs of growth. Things boiled over after several in-game mismanagement issues in Sunday's 17-10 loss to the Tennessee Titans.

The issues were enough for Tepper to move on from Reich after just 11 games.

"I want to convey that I have nothing but positive thoughts about Mr. Tepper," Reich told The Observe. "On a personal level, I saw a side of him that I deeply respect and care about. But the NFL is a meritocracy. It's not unconditional love. I understand from a professional standpoint Mr. Tepper is going to have certain standards that he expects to have met. I have no hard feelings, and my personal relationship with him was actually a real highlight of this short time." </textarea>
