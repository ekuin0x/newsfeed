                <textarea id="text" readonly> Chad Michael Murray just wants to live in the here and now.

Speaking with E! News in a recent interview, the actor shared his thoughts on ex-girlfriend Erin Foster's claims that he cheated on her "in a pretty egregious way" with Sophia Bush back in the early aughts.

"It's not one of those things that I want to go down the road of because there's just never a winner," Murray said of the claims. "I feel blessed to be where I am right now."

"I live in the now, I live in the present, I live in the future," he continued. "Things have changed so dramatically for me since I was a young man that I just try to live in this space â€” always. So, I don't think you'll ever find me saying anything negative or hurtful about anybody. I never will. That's just not me. I'm not going to do it."

Murray and Foster dated from 2001 to 2002. Bush and Murray officially started dating in 2003 while starring on One Tree Hill together. Their marriage in 2005 ended after five months.

"I have more regrets in my life than I care to think about, but I don't live in the past," Murray added. "I try to move forward every single day and just go, 'I got air in my lung, life in my step, the will to move forward and the sun's gonna rise on a beautiful tomorrow.'"

His comments come after Foster, during an episode of her The World's First Podcast last month, told her sister and fellow podcast host, Sara Foster, "I mean, yeah. He definitely did cheat on me with her, in like, a pretty egregious way. While we were living together. Pretty cool." (Reps for Bush and Murray declined to comment at the time.)

Erin's off-the-cuff claims on the podcast came as a response to Sara bringing up a recent DeuxMoi gossip item featuring an old photo of Erin and Murray that said "he apparently cheated on her with Sophia Bush."

It's all water under the bridge for Erin, though, who married businessman Simon Tikhman in 2019. "I've moved on. I'm over it now. I mean, just barely. Just barely over it," she joked on the podcast last month.
