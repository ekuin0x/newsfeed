                <textarea id="text" readonly> Fans of Destiny's Child are in for a treat when the Renaissance tour concert movie is released in theaters on December 1.

The latest trailer for the highly anticipated film dropped during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade and in it had an Easter egg for fans of the 2000's era girl group.

About 40 seconds into the clip fans get a brief glance of Beyoncé and Kelly Rowland reuniting with Destiny's Child's collaborators LaTavis Roberson and LaToya Luckett.

The Single Ladies singer, 42, embraced Roberson while Rowland, 42, hugged Luckett.

Bey and Williams founded Destiny's Child with Roberson and Luckett while Michelle Williams, 44, joined the group later.

The members of Destiny's Child reunited when the Irreplaceable singer's Renaissance World Tour made a stop in her hometown of Houston, Texas.

Farrah Franklin, who joined the group after Roberson and Luckett left, was the only former member who didn't appear in the film's trailer. Franklin left the group after just a few months.

According to the official synopsis for the film, the project 'accentuates the journey of RENAISSANCE WORLD TOUR, from its inception, to the opening in Stockholm, Sweden, to the finale in Kansas City, Missouri.

'It is about Beyoncé's intention, hard work, involvement in every aspect of the production, her creative mind and purpose to create her legacy, and master her craft,' the synopsis continued.

'Received with extraordinary acclaim, Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour created a sanctuary for freedom, and shared joy, for more than 2.7 million fans.'

'It's Beyoncé wishing you and your family a very happy Thanksgiving,' the Crazy in Love hitmaker said in a short introductory clip before the trailer aired.

'I'm so honored to share with you the first look at the new Renaissance film trailer.'

The clip moved on to footage from the upcoming tour film, during which the Run the World songstress talked about the legacy she's built including, but not limited to breaking the record for the highest-grossing female tour of all time.

'I have nothing to prove to anyone at this point,' Beyoncé says in the trailer, as clips of the singer on tour are shown.

'We are creating our own world, this is my reward. Nobody can take that away from me,' she added.

The Renaissance tour film joins 2019's Homecoming in the Beautiful Liar singer's growing resume of documentary film projects.

The film hopes to build off the success of Taylor Swift's Eras tour movie which grossed $246 million globally in its exclusive deal with AMC theaters. </textarea>
