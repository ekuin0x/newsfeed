                <textarea id="text" readonly> One decade after the "Kick Six" broke the hearts of Alabama fans at Jordan-Hare Stadium, the Tide returned the favor in the same corner of the end zone in what will forever be known as "Fourth-and-31." Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe's pass on fourth-and-goal from the 31-yard line landed in the waiting arms of Isiah Bond in the back corner of the end zone with 32 seconds to go in the game to save the No. 8 Crimson Tide from the brink of disaster as Alabama stormed back for a 27-24 win over Auburn in the Iron Bowl.

The miraculous play was the culmination of a wild sequence of events that nearly saw the one-loss Crimson Tide blow a golden opportunity in the red zone.

On second-and-goal from the 8-yard line, Alabama center Seth McLaughlin snapped the ball to an unprepared Milroe on second-and-goal from the 8 with under two minutes to play. Milroe recovered at the 26-yard line, however. The Tide signal-caller rolled left and all the way back to the right side on third-and-goal, crossed the line of scrimmage and tossed an incomplete pass with 43 seconds left. Despite the near-disaster, Milroe was able to snag a rabbit out of the hat with his late-game heroics.

Auburn appeared to have things in control when it held Alabama to three-and-out up four points with 4:48 to play. However, Keionte Scott muffed the punt and Jihaad Campbell recovered at the Auburn 30-yard line. That kept alive what wound up being the game-winning drive as Alabama remains in the College Football Playoff hunt entering next weekend's SEC Championship Game against No. 1 Georgia.

The Crimson Tide were 6 of 17 on third down but 0 of 4 in the fourth-quarter. They were 2 of 2 on fourth down in the final quarter, however, with the touchdown pass from Milroe to Bond being the dagger.

Alabama's offensive line only gave up one sack to the Tigers, which is a departure from the norm. The Crimson Tide's offensive line had given up 3.46 sacks per game on the season and has been a big question mark throughout the year.

Auburn didn't call a running play on its first two touchdown drives as Demari Alston scored from 2 yards out and wide receiver Ja'Varrius Johnson scored from 12 yards out on an end around for the second. Johnson, who also caught a 27-yard touchdown pass from Payton Thorne, is the first player to score a rushing and receiving touchdown in the Iron Bowl since 2005.

Milroe was credited with seven "big" plays through the air, which are considered plays of 20 or more yards. Those seven completions accounted for 200 of his 259 overall passing yards.
