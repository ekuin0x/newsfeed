                <textarea id="text" readonly> Isaiah Bond didn’t get the ball.

“I have no idea where the ball’s at,” the Alabama football wide receiver said after the Crimson Tide beat Auburn 27-24 in a miracle finish to the Iron Bowl. “I have no idea what I did with the ball after I made that catch, I can’t even lie. I think I threw it down. I think the ref might have grabbed it.”

Bond was of course referring to the ball he caught on a 31–yard 4th-and-goal heave to the end zone from the right hand of quarterback Jalen Milroe. The sophomore slid past the Auburn defense on a seam route and had to jump for it, with Tiger cornerback DJ James in between him and Milroe.

The Buford, Ga. native got up for it. Touchdown Alabama.

With 32 seconds left, the Crimson Tide took a 27-24 lead and avoided having to return to the Jordan-Hare Stadium locker room through a sea of celebrating Auburn fans.

“All the receivers did a great job opening the passing game and getting open,” Milroe told reporters after the game. “It just came down to trust, never giving up.”

The play was a desperation heave to the end zone after a bad snap and a penalty cost serious yardage near the goal, but it wasn’t a moment the Crimson Tide was unprepared for. According to Bond, it’s called Gravedigger.

There might be other names for it going forward. Alabama head coach Nick Saban said he wasn’t sharing the name of it, Milroe called it simply “win,” defensive back Malachi Moore suggested “4th-and-31,” while Bond advocated for including his “007″ nickname when remembering the moment.

Regardless, Saban has his offense run it in practice every Friday.

“We walk through and we do special situations,” Saban said. “We get in that formation, everybody runs down the field and runs varying routes in the end zone. And Jalen made a great throw, but IB really got himself into position where there was some room to throw it. He pushed inside and the DB was inside of him and he came back out, Jalen threw back out to him and it was a great catch. Great throw. But it is a play that we actually work on.

“And I must admit that I think you have to be a little lucky for it to work, but I’ll take it.”

Before the play, Saban told his quarterback that Auburn was likely to only rush two or three players. The key was going to be reading the receivers down the field and choosing the right man.

Milroe had all day to throw the ball. The Crimson Tide has struggled in that area all season and the play might have been the offensive line’s finest hour.

The quarterback was able to fully step up into the pocket and deliver the ball to Bond.

“It was all about reading what they gave,” Milroe said. “The biggest thing is the line gave protection, so I just tried to take time, as much as possible, and then read what they gave. And then at the end of the day, just execute.”

When Bond came down with the ball, there was immediately some question as to whether he’d completed the catch. Officials took a look, then allowed Will Reichard to kick the extra point.

The receiver himself had no doubt.

“I knew I had a foot down, most def,” Bond said. “Because I was probably at least two yards away from out of bounds. As a receiver you practice feeling the sideline, so I definitely felt the sideline, I knew it was a touchdown.”

Bond got up and did a James Bond-themed celebration. As he did so, he dropped the ball on the ground.

He hadn’t seen it since. Though, given the result, he wasn’t particularly concerned.

“If I get it I get it,” Bond said. “It is what it is.” </textarea>
