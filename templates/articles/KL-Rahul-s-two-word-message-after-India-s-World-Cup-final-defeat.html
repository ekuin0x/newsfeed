PM Modi consoles team India in dressing room after World Cup final loss against Australia

SIX TOPS AND FLOPS AT WORLD CUP

The Afghans enjoyed stellar performances starting with their stunning win over defending champions England, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Netherlands.

Glenn Maxwell smashed the tournament's fastest century in 40 balls in a match-winning 106 against the Netherlands in New Delhi. But Maxwell had only just got started as he then defied cramp and back spasms in a knock for the ages when he lifted Australia from 91-7 to victory with an unbeaten 201 against Afghanistan in Mumbai.

Virat Kohli lived up to his billing as one of the modern-day greats, recording a 50th ODI century to go past compatriot Sachin Tendulkar's 49 tons.

Babar Azam's team came in with huge expectations and started with two victories before their campaign hit a wall in the shadow of right security which director of cricket Mickey Arthur branded as "stifling".

Jos Buttler came into the tournament as captain of one of the fancied teams out to defend their title but their campaign fizzled out early after just one win in the first seven matches.

Sri Lanka batsman Angelo Mathews became the first batsman in 146 years of international cricket to be given "timed out" in an ill-tempered match against Bangladesh.

Rahul Dravid on India's loss, Rohit's captaincy: There was a lot of emotion in the dressing room

WORLD CUP FINAL: KEY MOMENTS

Australia captain Pat Cummins won the toss and opted to bowl first, gambling on the wicket getting easier to bat on.

India captain Rohit Sharma raced to 47 off just 31 balls with four boundaries and three sixes.

With his team sitting pretty on 76-1 in the 10th over, he launched the ball high into the off side where Travis Head, running back from cover, dived to take a spectacular catch.

Defending a modest 240, India were under the cosh when Australia racked up 41-1 off just 27 balls.

However, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami stemmed the bleeding as their opponents slipped to 47-3. Steve Smith was out lbw for just four but opted not to review.

It was a brief ray of hope for India which was snuffed out by Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne. Labuschagne engaged in a tense battle of words and staredowns with Virat Kohli as the pressure was ramped up.

The Australian had the last laugh, surviving an lbw decision off Bumrah on umpire's call when he had made 34 before going on to hit an undefeated 58 in a match-winning partnership of 192 with Head.

Opening batsman Travis Head almost missed the World Cup after breaking his hand in a pre-tournament series in South Africa and only joined up with the squad in India after a rehabilitation period.

On Sunday, he hit only the seventh century in a World Cup final and ended the match with a sparkling 137 off 120 balls with 15 fours and four sixes.
