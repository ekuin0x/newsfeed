                <textarea id="text" readonly> Geert Wilders, the veteran anti-Islam firebrand, has won a convincing victory in the Dutch general election after one of the country’s most close-fought campaigns for many years.

With nearly all votes counted, the leader of the Freedom Party (PVV), who has called for a ban on mosques, the Koran and Islamic schools, was well ahead of his two rivals in what had been expected to be a knife-edge three-way race.

Mr Wilders’ party was forecast to win 37 seats, more than double its share from the last elections in 2021 and two more than predicted by an exit poll when voting finished on Wednesday night.

“The largest party in the Netherlands, and I tell you, the voter has spoken. We are sick of it and we are going to ensure that the Dutchman comes first again,” the 60-year-old political veteran said amid cheers from his surprised and overjoyed supporters.

“We can’t be ignored,” he added, as he railed against the “asylum tsunami” and called on other parties to join him in coalition. </textarea>
