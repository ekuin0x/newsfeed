"It does not matter where in the country these teams are from â€“ fans in South Dakota love basketball, and they will help make this game a memorable one for the athletes and coaches."Auburn, a member of the SEC, is coming off a 21-13 season which saw the Tigers advance to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Forward, an All-SEC Second Team selection, is the team's top returning scorer (14.2 ppg), rebounder (8.4 rpg) and shot blocker (2.4 bpg).Three-time SEC Coach of the Yearreturns for his 10th season at Auburn.

This will be the first trip for Auburn to the state of South Dakota."What a great opportunity to play a perennial Top 10 program with a great coach like Scott Drew," Pearl said. "Our guys came to Auburn and the SEC, to play against the very best. We will get to see right away where we are as a team. A marquee matchup like this, playing a guaranteed Quad 1 opponent, will help us build our potential tournament resume and get us prepared for league play."Baylor, a member of the Big 12, finished last season with an overall record of 23-11, advancing to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The Bears played a memorable game at the Sanford Pentagon in 2022, defeating Gonzaga, 64-63, in front of a sold-out crowd.Head coach Scott Drew enters his 21st season at Baylor. The school's all-time winningest head coach led the team to the national championship in 2022."Complete Sports Management and Sanford are the best in the business," Drew said. "We always enjoy working with them and thoroughly enjoyed our experience at the Pentagon last year. Our game sold out with Gonzaga in six minutes, and the crowd was amazing. We can't wait to be back there in November."This year's contest will mark the eighth all-time meeting between Auburn and Baylor. The Bears lead 5-2 in the all-time series having won 84-72 in both teams' last meeting as part of the Big 12/SEC Challenge on Jan. 30, 2021 in Waco, Texas.Auburn versus Baylor is the third NCAA Division I men's basketball game announced for this season at the Sanford Pentagon.
