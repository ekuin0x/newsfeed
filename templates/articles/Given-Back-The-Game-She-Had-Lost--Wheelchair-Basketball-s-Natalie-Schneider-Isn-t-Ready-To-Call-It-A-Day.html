                <textarea id="text" readonly> There was a time when Natalie Schneider didn’t care much for basketball. Growing up in Nebraska, her father was a coach, and the whole family would attend his games. While her mom, brother and sister sat by and watched the action on the court, young Natalie turned her back and colored.

“Even when I hated going, I still had to go,” she recalled. “I didn’t like watching basketball.”

Things changed in a big way in second grade, when someone finally handed her a ball.

“When I actually started playing it, I was like, ‘Oh, this is really fun,’” Schneider said.

It was game on from that point.

Though running basketball later turned to wheelchair basketball, Schneider never stopped playing. At age 40, she is now a four-time Paralympian — and two-time champ — in the sport, and this month she leads the U.S. women’s team in the 2023 Parapan American Games in Santiago, Chile, where they’ll aim to not just improve upon the silver medal they won four years ago but also earn a spot at the Paralympic Games Paris 2024, which they can do with a win.

Schneider is a co-captain for the experienced U.S. team that includes three-time Paralympians Becca Murray, the other co-captain, and Rose Hollermann, as well as seven other players from the team that won a bronze medal at the 2022 world championships roster. Eight of the 12 were on the Tokyo 2020 team.

“We have a really solid mix,” boasts Schneider. “I haven’t seen this much depth on the USA team since 2008, so that’s really exciting.”

A Hoops Journey





When she began falling for the game, Schneider was first drawn to the fast pace, and how she could lose herself on the court.

“I’m actually very analytical. I’m a math person,” she said. “Basketball is sort of my escape from that where I can just like react and do what’s natural instead of overanalyzing things.” </textarea>
