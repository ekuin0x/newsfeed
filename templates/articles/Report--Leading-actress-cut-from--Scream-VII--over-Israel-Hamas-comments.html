                <textarea id="text" readonly> UNDATED (WKRC) - The lead actress of a highly-anticipated horror movie has been reportedly fired from the project over her comments about the Israel-Hamas war.

Melissa Barrera, who starred in both "Scream V" (2022) and "Scream VI" (2023), is no longer a part of the production of "Scream VII."

Since Hamas' invasion of Israel, the Mexican actress has made dozens of posts about the conflict on social media.

“As a latina, a proud Mexicana, I feel the responsibility of having a platform that allows me the privilege of being heard, and therefore I have tried to use it to raise awareness about issues I care about and to lend my voice to those in need,” she wrote in an Instagram story. “Every person on this earth- regardless of religion, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or socio-economic status -- deserves equal human rights, dignity and, of course, freedom.”



Another Instagram post read, "Gaza is currently being treated like a concentration camp. Cornering everyone together, with no where to go, no electricity no water People have learnt nothing from our histories. And just like our histories, people are still silently watching it all happen. THIS IS GENOCIDE & ETHNIC CLEANSING.”

Spyglass Media Group, the studio that obtained the rights to the "Scream" franchise after the closure of The Weinstein Company, charactized her remarks as "antisemitic," according to .

“Spyglass’ stance is unequivocally clear: We have zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech," the studio said in a statement.



It was announced a short time later that Barrera's fellow "Scream" lead, actress Jenna Ortega, would also not be returning for "Scream VII."

However, reports this is due to a scheduling conflict with Ortega's Netflix show "Wednesday," and not related to Barrera being let go. </textarea>
