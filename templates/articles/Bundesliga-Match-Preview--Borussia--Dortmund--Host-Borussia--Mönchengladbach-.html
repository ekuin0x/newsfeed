                <textarea id="text" readonly> Did you all enjoy the international break? No? Well fear not, because you can now stop smashing your keyboard in frustration at the failings of the USMNT or Die Nationalelf, and you can go back to smashing your keyboard in frustration at the failings of Borussia Dortmund.

I kid, obviously. Mostly. Borussia Dortmund return to the Bundesliga this weekend by hosting Borussia Mönchengladbach at the Westfalenstadion. Both clubs have disappointed their respective fans in their own way. Despite Borussia Dortmund’s early struggles this season, Gladbach have not fared any better, and are currently treading water in 9th place. This is a result that both clubs will desperately need.

Player to Watch: Julian Weigl

Hey, I remember him! And holy cow, he’s 28 years old??? That makes me feel very, very old. The former BVB teenage phenom has not quite had the career that many expected when he was an anchor in midfield at age 19 under Thomas Tuchel, but he has found at least something of his old role with Borussia Mönchengladbach, and as the captain, no less. He’s the only player who has featured in every single minute for Gladbach, and has returned to his old role as the chief executive in midfield, managing the tempo of the game and letting everything run through his feet. He’s at or near the top of all of his squad’s passing stats. If BVB are to control the match tomorrow, keeping the ball out of Julian’s feet will be critical to their success.

Lineup Prediction

During the international break, Edin Terzic announced that Felix Nmecha will miss the remainder of the calendar year. I would hope that this opening in midfield gives Gio Reyna an opportunity to start for Borussia Dortmund; I believe that both he and Jamie Bynoe-Gittens looked terrific in BVB’s match against Hoffenheim, and could potentially recreate that success against Gladbach. While Terzic seems hell-bent on playing Julian Brandt on the wing, I’d like to see Reyna start regardless.

On the back line, I really like Niklas Süle at right back, especially over Marius Wolf. Meanwhile, Gregor Nobel picked up a muscle injury last week, but by most accounts should be healthy to play tomorrow.

Scoreline Prediction

At least over the last decade, this matchup has been extremely lopsided, at least in Dortmund, with Die Fohlen having lost every Bundesliga match at the Westfalenstadion since March, 2014. I predict a BVB win, 2-0. </textarea>
