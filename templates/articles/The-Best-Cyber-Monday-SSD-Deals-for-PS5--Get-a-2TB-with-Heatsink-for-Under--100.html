Cyber Monday Deal: Lexar NM790 2TB PS5 SSD with Heatsink for $94.99

1TB for $50.95 Lexar NM790 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD with Heatsink 37% off $149.99 5 $94.95 See on Amazon

The Lexar NM790 is currently the least expensive 2TB PS5 SSD on Amazon. It comes with a preinstalled aluminum heatsink that looks like it will do the job properly, it's considerably faster than the 5,600MB/s minimum recommendation, and it was specifically made to fit in the PS5's drive bay slot without obtrusion. At this price, there's little reason to choose another SSD if your only intent is to expand your PS5 storage.

Cyber Monday Deal: Nextorage 1TB PS5 SSD with Heatsink for $55.99

Nextorage Japan 1TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD with Heatsink 56% off $129.99 9 $55.99 See on Amazon

There's an interesting story behind Nextorage Japan. Nextorage describes itself as a company that was "created by a group of ex-Sony engineers and staff with over 20 years of experience in the development of memory and storage products". Nextorage was actually originally created by Sony in 2019 as an SSD sub-division about a year before the PS5 was released. Presumably this was to be the basis for an official SSD sold by Sony themselves. For whatever reason, Sony decided to ditch that idea and sold this business to another stakeholder in the company, Phison, in 2022. Phison is another large reputable company that specializes in solid state memory controllers. You'll find their controllers in name-brand SSDs like Seagate, Corsair, and Sabrent. Under Phison, Nextorage Japan eventually accomplished the goal of releasing an SSD catered specifically for the PS5 console in the form of this product right here.

Cyber Monday Deal: Seagate Game Drive 2TB SSD with Heatsink $149.99

Seagate Game Drive 4TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD with Heatsink 28% off $209.99 7 $149.99 See on Amazon

Now here's an SSD you don't see discounted often. The Seagate Game Drive is only the second SSD to be officially licensed for the PlayStation console. What that means is this SSD is pretty much guaranteed to work with your PS5 with no problems whatsoever. It's pricier than the other options in this list, but it's still a hefty discount off MSRP and the lowest price we've seen. Seagate is a very reputable brand.

Cyber Monday Deal: WD Black SN850X 4TB PS5 SSD for $229.99

WD Black SN850X 4TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD 21% off $289.99 0 $229.99 See on Amazon

The SN850X is the latest generation of WD's flagship Black series M.2 SSDs. It's easily one of the fastest SSDs on the market. There are only a few SSDs out right now that can match its speed. Off the top of my head, the only SSDs I can think of are the new Samsung 990 Pro and the SK Hynix P41 Platinum. The SN850X also makes for an excellent PS5 SSD. It is identical to the SN850P, which is an officially licensed PS5 SSD. The only caveat is that this particular model doesn't include a built-in heatsink. That is easily remedied by picking up a PS5 heatsink off Amazon for $7.

Cyber Monday Deal: Corsair MP600 2TB PS5 SSD with Heatsink $110

Corsair MP600 PRO LPX 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD with Heatsink 12% off $124.99 18 $109.99 See on Amazon

Corsair is a very well known brand for DIY PC builders. Corsair makes some of the best gaming products on the market, and that includes solid-state memory like RAM and SSDs. The MP600 Pro is Corsair's fastest M.2 SSD and the "LPX" model is "optimized for PS5" because it includes a rugged preinstalled heatsink that is slim enough to fit in the PS5 bay without any issues. We rated it the best PS5 SSD for 2023.

Cyber Monday Deal: Samsung 980 Pro 2TB M.2 SSD with Heatsink $119.99

Samsung 980 Pro 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD 8% off $129.99 5 $119.99 See on Amazon

Samsung SSDs need no introduction. They've made some of the most popular and reliable PS5 SSDs on the market. The 980 Pro has been out for a long time, way back in January of 2020. A testament to its reliability is the fact that Samsung didn't feel any need to release any newer flagship model until only this year. In terms of performance, it's no longer the fastest SSD on the market (the 990 Pro is), but it's still a very fast drive. It certainly more than meets the minimum 5600MB/s speed requirement to be used as a PS5 storage upgrade, with speeds of up to 7,100MB/s.

What is a PS5-compatible SSD?

An SSD that expands your PS5's storage is essentially the same SSD that goes into your gaming PC. However, because of the PS5 has certain requirements that must be met for full compatibility. These are:

The SSD and its heatsink must fit in the PS5 drive bay (requirement)

The SSD must have a PCIe 4.0 interface (requirement)

The SSD should have a minimum read speed of 5600MB/s (recommended)

The SSD should have a heatsink for proper cooling (recommended)

An SSD that is slower than 5,600MB/s should still work. In fact, if it's close to the rated speed, you may never notice any difference. The reason Sony gives this recommendation is that the stock SSD that comes with the PS5 is rated at 5,600MB/s. If you add a slower SSD, you will bottleneck your stock SSD.

Likewise, you may not need a heatsink. SSDs are rated for higher temps than what you'd normally expect to achieve even inside a PS5 that's running fult tilt. However, there's no real airflow around the SSD bay and SSDs do get pretty hot. We'd recommend getting a preinstalled heatsink or installing one yourself for peace of mind and potentially to prevent thermal throttling and extending the lifespan of your SSD.

Can I use this SSD in my gaming PC?

Absolutely! PS5-compatible SSDs will work with any PC with an available M.2 slot that supports PCIe 4.0 M.2 solid state drives. In fact, if you get a PS5-compatible SSD, you're essentially guaranteed to get an SSD that's going to perform extremely well because of the higher rated speed. </textarea>
