                <textarea id="text" readonly> HOOVER — With elimination on the line for both teams, Alabama baseball will take on rival Auburn on Thursday in the SEC Tournament.

The game is scheduled to start 35 minutes after the conclusion of Texas A&M and South Carolina, which starts at 9:30 a.m. CT. The game should start around 1 p.m. and will air on SEC Network.

Alabama won the regular season series, with 4-2 and 6-1 wins in the final two games. Auburn won the opener 8-4, scoring the first eight runs before Alabama scored four in the bottom of the ninth.

The 9-seeded Crimson Tide are coming off a 7-6 loss to top-seeded Florida, in which they held a three-run lead going into the bottom of the 11th. Alabama would allow one run to score before being walked off with a three-run home run.

The 5-seeded Tigers are coming off a 6-4 loss to Vanderbilt in which they hit three home runs but couldn't get much offense going outside of those.
