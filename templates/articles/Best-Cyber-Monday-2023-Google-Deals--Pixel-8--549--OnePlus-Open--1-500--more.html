                <textarea id="text" readonly> Cyber Monday is now here at 9to5Google and our team over at 9to5Toys has been working around the clock to bring you all of the best deals. Through Thanksgiving week, we’ll be delivering all of the most notable markdowns on Google devices, home goods, fashion, and much more. Down below, you’ll find only the best of the best as part of our curated Cyber Monday deal hub for the week, which will be constantly updated with all of the latest Google offers in one central location.

Cyber Monday launches at every major retailer

As expected, nearly every major player in the game has unveiled deals for Black Friday and Cyber Monday at this point. Amazon is leading the way with its rotating Gold Boxes that go live every morning at 3 a.m. ET. This time around, we’re expecting some of the biggest discounts to date on smart home technology, TVs, Apple gear, and more to come from Amazon. Make sure to bookmark this page for all of the latest price drops.

The folks over at Best Buy are also competing heavily this year, with an aggressive sale that offers a little extra savings for my Best Buy members. And we can’t forget about Walmart, who is also offering one of the best Cyber Monday sales this year, too.

Apple headlines this year’s best deals

Cyber Monday is easily one of the best times of the year to buy Apple gear, and for 2023 just about everything from the company is on sale. All-new M3 MacBooks? You bet. Lowest prices of the year on AirPods? We’ve got them. iPads? Yup! Not to mention tons of accessories for the whole lineup too.

Official Apple accessories are also getting in on the savings, with everything from its new lineup of iPhone 15 covers being joined by MagSafe chargers and more. There are 25% price cuts on nearly everything below, if not even steeper savings being applied too.
