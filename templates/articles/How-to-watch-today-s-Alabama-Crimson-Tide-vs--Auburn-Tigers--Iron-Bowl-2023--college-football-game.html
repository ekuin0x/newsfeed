Watch NCAA football live with a digital HDTV antenna

Amazon

If you're cutting the cord to your cable company, you're not alone; in fact, you are in luck. You can still watch the NFL on TV with an affordable indoor antenna, which pulls in local over-the-air HDYC channels such as CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, PBS, Univision and more. Here's the kicker: There's no monthly charge.

Anyone living in partially blocked-off area (those near mountains or first-floor apartments), a digital TV antenna may not pick up a good signal -- or any signal at all. But for many homes, a digital TV antenna provides a seriously inexpensive way to watch college football without paying a cable company. Indoor TV antennas can also provide some much-needed TV backup if a storm knocks out your cable (or your cable company gets in a squabble with a network).

This amplified indoor HDTV antenna claims to have a 250-mile range and comes with a 16.5-foot coaxial cable. It's rated 4.0 stars by Amazon reviewers. Regularly $33, it's currently on sale for $23 after Black Friday and ahead of Cyber Monday, but you'll need to be an Amazon Prime member to score the deal.

More teams to follow during the 2023 college football season

Important dates for the 2023 college football season:

The 13-week 2023 college football season runs from Aug. 27 through Dec. 9.

Two semifinal games, the Rose Bowl Game and the Allstate Sugar Bowl, are scheduled for New Year's Day (Monday, January 1, 2024).

The College Football Playoff National Championship is scheduled for Monday, January 8, 2024 at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.

The Georgia Bulldogs want to make history: The Georgia Bulldogs want to make history: The Bulldogs struck gold last season winning back-to-back championships after beating the Alabama Crimson Tide 33-18 in 2022. Since 1936, no college team has won three-in-a-row. Coming into Week 13, the Bulldogs are one of six teams that remain undefeated and have reclaimed the top spot in just about every college football ranking. Head coach Kirby Smart started the season aiming for the elusive three-peat, which is looking less elusive with each game of the season.

Football fans can't get enough of the Colorado Buffaloes: If it seems like the biggest story of the 2023 NCAA college football season isn't on the field, you're not wrong. Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders, aka Coach Prime, has dominated sports headlines since he announced in December of 2022 he'd leave the 11-1 Jackson State football program he'd built over the past three years in favor of the 1-11 Colorado Buffaloes. Coach Prime in prime time has proven a success despite the team's 4-7 record. Winning or losing, the Buffaloes have seen skyrocketing TV ratings, the one bright spot in an ugly year for Pac-12 football.

How will all the college football shake ups shake out? In July 2022, UCLA and USC finally agreed on something. The frenemy rivals would both leave the Pac-12 in favor of the Big Ten in 2024. This summer, Colorado announced it would return to the Big 12. Since then, Arizona, Arizona State and Utah have announced an exodus from the Pac-12 to the Big-12 at the end of the 2023 season. Washington and Oregon State are also ditching the Pac-12 for the Big 10 at the same time.

The school shuffling won't affect the 2023 season much, but expect journalists to talk about it to no end. With the Pac-12 currently down to just four teams for the 2024 season, the demise of the Pac-12 is sure to be one of the biggest stories of the season.
