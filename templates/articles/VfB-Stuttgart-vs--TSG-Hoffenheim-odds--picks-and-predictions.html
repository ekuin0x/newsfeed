VfB Stuttgart vs. TSG Hoffenheim picks and predictions

Prediction

Stuttgart 3, Hoffenheim 1

BET STUTTGART (-120).

Simply put, Stuttgart has been unstoppable at home, and it has been dominant in general this season. It does have a 3-1 win over Wolfsburg, which sits 9th. Neither team has a ton of quality wins as Stuttgart lost 3-1 to Leipzig and Hoffenheim lost 3-1 to Eint Frankfurt this season, both of which are top-7 teams in the league.

The edge should go to the home side as Hoffenheim’s success on the road should cool off, and at this value, the home side with more quality wins is worth taking. Back STUTTGART (-120).

LEAN OVER 3.5 (+120).

Stuttgart has a dominant attack, having tallied 3 or more goals in 6 of 8 league games, scoring 5 twice at home this season. It has had at least 2.3 expected goals in 4 of 8 games as well. It has just been terrific at home.

Hoffenheim also has a strong offense and has scored in every game, even against tough defenses like Dortmund. It has had at least an expected goal in each game as well.

Expect these dominant offenses to continue to stay hot Saturday. Take OVER 3.5 (+120).
