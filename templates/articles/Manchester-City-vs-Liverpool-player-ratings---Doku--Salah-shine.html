                <textarea id="text" readonly> MANCHESTER – The Manchester City vs Liverpool player ratings were a lot of fun to dish out as the Premier League heavyweights dished up a post-Thanksgiving treat at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.

Pep Guardiola’s men went ahead through Erling Haaland but Jurgen Klopp’s side hung in there and snatched a point thanks to Trent Alexander-Arnold’s lovely 80th-minute strike.

Below are the Manchester City vs Liverpool player ratings in full, with marks out of 10 and analysis on every player.

Manchester City player ratings

Ederson: 7 - Made a good stop in each half and was as solid as ever. Couldn’t do anything on Liverpool’s goal.



Kyle Walker: 7 - Did a really good job on Jota and did his best to make himself an option in attack.



Ruben Dias: 7 - Solid as ever and made some great last-ditch tackles and blocks.

Nathan Ake: 8 - Mazy run set up Haaland’s goal and dealt with the threat of Salah incredibly well.

Rodri: 7 - Dominant as usual in midfield and provides an incredible base for City to launch attacks.

Manuel Akanji: 7 - Plugged the defensive gaps really well and so calm on the ball.

Phil Foden: 6 - Had one shot saved well by Alisson but didn’t get a chance to get in-behind Liverpool and was a little frustrated.

Bernardo Silva: 8 - Silky display as he cut through Liverpool’s midfield so often with a delicate pass or twizzle of his hips.

Julian Alvarez: 6 - Wasted a few good opportunities on the counter and blazed over when well-placed in the second half.

Jeremy Doku: 8 - Gave Trent Alexander-Arnold kittens and turned him inside out all game long. Whipped in so many crosses but his teammates couldn’t quite get on the end of it.

Erling Haaland: 7 - Got his goal and worked hard to close down Liverpool’s defenders. Not heavily involved, but did his job and almost scored the winner late on.

Alexander-Arnold's rocket equalizes for Liverpool Trent Alexander-Arnold takes a touch and blasts his effort into the bottom corner of the net to get Liverpool back level at 1-1 against Manchester City at the Etihad.

Liverpool player ratings

Alisson: 5 - Made some sloppy mistakes on the ball early on and made a huge mistake to slip which led to Haaland’s goal. Lucky to get away with not conceding a second after a soft foul was given on him.

Trent Alexander-Arnold: 6 - Got through a lot of defensive work and couldn’t stop Doku driving inside and whipping in crosses. But did drill home the equalizer with a beauty of a finish.

Joel Matip: 6 - Did his best to clear crosses and cover Haaland’s runs.

Virgil van Dijk: 6 - Clipped some good balls forward but may have done better on Haaland’s goal to cover across.

Kostas Tsimikas: 6 - Did okay defensively to lock down Foden but had little threat going forward. Solid.

Dominik Szoboszlai: 6 - Some nice touches but couldn’t really impact the game. Subbed off.

Alexis Mac Allister: 5 - Overrun in midfield and playing in a deeper role just isn’t working for him.

Curtis Jones: 5 - Couldn’t keep the ball well enough and after a few nice touches in the first half he faded. Subbed off early in the second half.

Mohamed Salah: 8 - Some excellent through balls and crosses into the box. Always looking to stretch City’s defense by popping up out wide and then centrally. Class to set up Alexander-Arnold’s goal too.

Darwin Nunez: 6 - Had a good chance in each half from tight angles but couldn’t convert. Worked hard.

Diogo Jota: 5 - Couldn’t get behind Walker in the first half and subbed off with an injury in the second. </textarea>
