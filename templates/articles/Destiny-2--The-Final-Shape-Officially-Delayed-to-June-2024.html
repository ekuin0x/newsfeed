                <textarea id="text" readonly> Following rumors and reports that the expansion was delayed, Bungie has officially revealed that Destiny 2's next expansion, The Final Shape, has been pushed back to June 4, 2024.

The release date for The Final Shape has moved to June 4, 2024 to allow for an even bigger and bolder vision.

In a blog post, Bungie confirmed that it is delaying the expansion, stating it needs "more time to become exactly what [Bungie] want it to be." The expansion was supposed to be released on Feb. 27, 2024.

"The Final Shape is the culmination of the first ten years of Destiny storytelling and, for Guardians everywhere, countless hours spent together," Bungie wrote in the blog post. "We want to honor that journey, so we're taking the time we need to deliver an even bigger and bolder vision, one that we hope will be remembered and treasured for years to come."

The announcement follows recent reports that Bungie would delay The Final Shape after the company suffered mass layoffs late last month. According to reports, Bungie CEO Pete Parsons told employees that the layoffs were due to Destiny 2's underperformance over the last year, in addition to The Final Shape's preorder numbers being lower than expected.

Earlier this month, Bungie released its first statement following the layoffs, acknowledging the "difficult week" the company had endured, the concerns and feedback players shared regarding Destiny 2, and the mixed reception to the Lightfall expansion. In that same blog post, Bungie pledged that The Final Shape expansion will be an "unforgettable experience."

The Final Shape was announced last August; the upcoming expansion will have players exploring a new destination called The Pale Heart. One of the biggest changes coming to the expansion is that it will include an episodic format, ditching the previous structure of the company releasing four seasons per year.
