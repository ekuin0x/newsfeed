                <textarea id="text" readonly> Cyber Monday is traditionally a day when you shop for televisions or Christmas presents, and not so much for outdoor gear. But it's not all TVs and headphones—there are plenty of Cyber Monday outdoor deals. While REI famously “shuns” the weekend's shopping holiday, the retailer still holds a sale immediately beforehand, as well as on Cyber Monday. Other outdoor stores are getting in on the action, too. Now is a great time to save some money on tents, backpacks, sleeping pads, and Garmin devices.

Updated November 27: We've added deals on bike bags and a personal water filter, and updated pricing and availability as Cyber Monday comes to an end.

We test products year-round and handpicked these deals. The discount amounts we show are based on actual street prices at retailers in the past few months. Products that are sold out or no longer discounted as of publishing will be crossed out. We'll update this guide periodically.

If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.

Backpack Deals

Photograph: Mountainsmith

Our favorite lumbar pack, the Tour is loaded with pockets, which gives you far more stash spaces than would seem possible in a pack this size. We've had no trouble fitting a change of clothes and a couple of meals in here, in addition to the gear you'll need for a full day on the trail or on a bike. The 13L version is also on sale for $75 ($25 off).

If the other Mystery Ranch packs that are currently on sale are too militaristic for you, this smaller, lighter pack is well worth it. The Catalyst 18 is the standard daypack in Mystery Ranch's lineup, but features the company's three-zip design. That said, all hunting- and outdoor-related gear is 30 percent off with this code so there's plenty to choose from.

Photograph: GoRuck

We love GoRuck's over-the-top sturdy packs. Packs don't come better made than this. The Bullet is the smallest of GoRuck's bags and makes a good pack for around town (the laptop compartment is awesome) or short, lightweight hikes. GoRuck's packs aren't cheap, but this deal makes the price a little easier to bear.

We haven't tested this exact pack, but reviewer Scott Gilbertson has been testing the similar Deuter Speed Lite 30 ($124) all fall (it's also on sale), and he owns the Trail 25 ACT from a few years back, which is similar. Both of those are very comfortable, sturdy packs, and the Pro 33L here looks to be the same. It has a nice set of internal organization options, a decent hipbelt for this size pack, and Deuter's trademark venting system to keep your back cool.

Reviewer Scott Gilbertson's son grew up in this pack, which carried him from the mountains of Colorado to the hot barren mesas of Chaco Canyon. It's not cheap (though this deal takes some of the pain away), but it's well-made, and, most important, stable and comfortable. It's also the easiest kid-hiking-pack he has tested to take on and off, which you will inevitably do, a lot.

Photograph: Brevite

The Jumper is one of our favorite camera bags. It's stylish and doesn't look like a camera bag. Yet you get the side pocket common on camera bags for easy access to the camera inside, and you can unzip the front to grab additional lenses. There's a zippered pocket on the front with some mesh pouches for batteries, cables, or SD cards, and the main compartment is roomy enough to hold a sweater (or lunch).

20 percent off sitewide and 20 percent off a future order doesn't make a Mission Workshop bag cheap. But if you've had your eye on the fully waterproof and customizable Khyte, which is one of our favorite messenger bags, this is the sale for you. Don't be fooled by the BF23 or the fact that the text urging you to use the code is no longer present on the sales page. We tested it at checkout, and it still works.

Every high school kid has a SuperBreak Plus, which is one of the most affordable laptop backpacks in our guide. The 600 denier fabric makes for a tough bag. You get a spacious main compartment, side bottle pocket, and an interior padded 15-inch laptop sleeve.

Road Runner makes our favorite bike bags. Reviews editor Adrienne So has the Lil Guy fanny pack and the Slacker day pack. They're made from durable cordura and the Lil Guy has a sling for a U-lock for her bike. They're some of her favorite bags.

Fitness Tracker Deals

Photograph: Garmin

The Instinct 2S Solar (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best value for the money in the sports watch category. It has insanely good battery life thanks to its small, sharp monochrome screen. The Instinct can track an incredible array of fitness-related features and it has three GPS systems to pinpoint location and distance, even at sea or under tree cover.

Garmin's Forerunner line of GPS-enabled fitness trackers is bewilderingly complex, but this is our favorite (8/10, WIRED Recommends). You get great battery life in a lightweight, comfortable watch. There's all the detailed fitness tracking you'd expect, especially for running, hiking, and cycling. It also has pretty good sleep tracking. The Music version, which allows you to store and listen to music via Bluetooth headphones, is also on sale for $300 ($100 off). If you're not sure which Garmin to get, have a look at our guide to picking the right model.

If you're breaking off your toothbrush handle to reduce weight in your hyperlight pack, you need an inReach Mini. It's tiny—a mere 3.5 ounces—and utilizes the super-fast Iridium satellite network, which will let you send an SOS from anywhere on the planet. It's one of our favorite satellite messengers for traveling off-grid.

Photograph: Apple

The Apple Watch Ultra 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old but it's already on sale. It's our favorite smartwatch for outdoor sports. It packs a new (and bright) 3,000-nit display, the latest S9 chip for faster processing, and the new ultra-wideband chip for precision-locating your phone. It's a great option if you're heavily into outdoor sports and are looking for a rugged, full-functioning smartwatch to take along with you. It's also the Apple Watch with the best battery life thanks to its massive size.

This is the best price we've seen for the Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Review), the latest addition to the Charge lineup. Its predecessor remains our favorite fitness tracker, but this model struggles at times. The companion app leaves a bit to be desired, there's no fall detection, and Bluetooth connectivity is glitchy. You should also be aware that to access every feature, you'll need a Fitbit Premium subscription that costs $10 per month. All that being said, at this price, the Fitbit Charge 6 is a simple and focused fitness tracker with a pretty robust suite of health metrics.

Withings just released the ScanWatch 2, so the first generation of the company's watch to be cleared by the FDA is now heavily discounted. This hybrid smartwatch (8/10, WIRED Recommends) looks exactly like an analog watch with a host of reliable health and fitness features.

Photograph: ŌURA

The Oura Ring is one of the first, and arguably one of the best, models of fitness tracker that you don't have to wear on your wrist. Every model has a discount, although not all of them are the same price off. You will still need a $6/month Oura membership to access many of the best features.

This full-featured Wear OS smartwatch has some of the best battery life you'll find—roughly three days—despite its capabilities. That's thanks to a smart dual-layer display that barely sips juice when you're not using the watch. Read more about it in our Best Smartwatches guide.

Photograph: Samsung

The Galaxy Watch6 Classic has some exclusive features for Samsung phone owners only—like the electrocardiogram—but technically any Android owner can use this smartwatch. It has better battery life than an Apple Watch, smooth performance, and a fun mechanical rotating bezel. You can save some dough on the standard Galaxy Watch6 if you don't care for the mechanical bezel.

This barely smart watch looks attractive and barely ever needs recharging thanks to Casio's Tough Solar tech. It has a stopwatch, a compass, and a barometer, plus it's rugged yet comfy. Read more in our Best Smartwatches guide.

E-Bike and Scooter Deals

Electra Loft Go! Photograph: Electra

Rad Power Bikes is one of the first direct-to-consumer ebike companies, and as such has been the subject of some painful lawsuits as the market has grown. However, it's still a very popular bike, very affordable, and very fun and easy to ride. All of their bikes are on sale but most people seem to ride the basic RadRunner, which is insanely powerful for the price, if a little unwieldy for smaller riders.

This is the affordable, DTC version of the now-defunct VanMoof (8/10, WIRED Recommends). You get a stylish, attractive bike for not a lot of money. All of Wing's bikes are currently on sale.

Electra's newest comfy cruiser (7/10, WIRED Review) is almost 20 pounds lighter than the last time senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So tested it, thanks to a new, super-lightweight motor. It's beautiful, she says—perfect for keeping up with her much faster husband, and now even more affordable.

Photograph: Aventon

We've tried several Aventon models and appreciate the high level of quality for a relatively low price point (the accessories are better than Lectric's, too). This fat-tire ebike (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is affordable, versatile, and has built-in commuter essentials. We also like the Soltera.2 and the Abound, both of which are on sale.

The Fluidfreeride Mosquito escooter (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is lightweight and easy to carry, but still packs a top speed of 24 miles per hour, a loud horn, drum breaks, plus front and reaR lights. It has a quick folding system too, and you can even fold the handlebars.

We tested the premium version of this bike (8/10, WIRED Recommends) and loved it. The best way to describe it is that it's one of Specialized's cushiony, comfy mountain bikes that has been given a motor and some adjustments to make it an all-around quiver killer. This will be the most-used bike you own.

Photograph: Ride1Up

Ride1Up positions the Cafe Cruiser as its light, affordable daily cruiser (7/10, WIRED Recommends) but with a 750W motor and a 65-pound frame, it's pretty big and powerful for an entry-level bike. Still, at this price (and for these specs!) it's a pretty amazing value.

Take it from a reformed never-helmet rider: Wear a damn helmet! It doesn't take long to become used to wearing it, and with style as good as those at Nutcase, you'll get compliments and admiring looks much more often than derisive snickers. Where else can you find a bike helmet painted to look like a watermelon? Protect your melon. Ride helmeted.

This is the latest version of our favorite micro ebike. The next big trend in electric bikes is micro-mobility, which refers to tiny personal vehicles. Tiny bikes are more affordable, easier to transport, and easier to store. And just like mini anything, they're completely irresistible.

Photograph: Peak Design

We love pretty much everything Peak Design makes, which is amazing because almost everything is currently 10 to 15 percent off. Senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So particularly likes the Bike Mount, which locks your phone in place with the Everyday Case, which is also on sale, unless you want the iPhone 15 or Pixel 8 versions. The bags are also on sale today.

We've tested a number of GoTrax's escooters but we like the company's folding, step-through ebike as well. It has the usual pitfalls of a cheap folding ebike (heavy, awkward) but it has a decent 20-mile range and all the commuter essentials for well under $1,000.

In his review of the folding ebike Montague M-E1 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) reviews editor Julian Chokkattu referred to the M-E1 as "pretty darn close to perfection." This is not an amazing deal, but if you have a folding ebike you were probably going to travel with it anyway.

Showers Pass Crosspoint Gloves Photograph: Showers Pass

If you're biking outside in the winter, you need gloves. These aren't going to be as warm as shell gloves, but for above-30-degree temperatures in the rain, they keep senior editor Adrienne So's hands warm and dry. Showers Pass is one of our favorite rainwear companies and it's holding a week of Cyber Specials.

Apparel and Footwear Deals

Photograph: Icebreaker

An Icebreaker hoodie was reviewer Medea Giordano's introduction to merino wool, and it remains one of the best jackets she's ever owned. This jacket is 100 percent merino and incredibly warm, despite not being all that thick. That makes it a great option for days when the weather may vary considerably–it's warm enough for a cold morning but won't be a burden in your pack the rest of the day. This deal was better earlier in the week, but it's still a good price.

This shirt is an updated version of the all-season version we like. This one is 100 percent merino and fits fairly snug, making it a good choice for layering. The price varies by color, but most are $86. The women's version is also on sale, in some cases for even less (select colors).

We like these zero-padded socks for everyday use and hiking. They're plenty soft and not too tight. They're only about 50 percent merino (the rest is various forms of nylon) so they won't be quite as odor-resistant as full merino socks, but they make a good intro to the world of wool socks. If you prefer some extra cushion in the heel and toe areas, the Light Cushion and Full Cushion versions are also on sale.

Free Fly's Bamboo Shade Hoodies are one of our favorite picks for Sun Protective Clothing. Of all the sun shirts we tried, it felt the least sticky once we were moving.

Photograph: Smartwool

We love these long-sleeve Smartwool shirts for how soft they are. The heavy-duty seams (read: sturdier, longer lasting) are not so heavy that they cause any discomfort—the shirts lie flat and sit off the shoulder, as any half-decent base layer should. These aren't 100 percent merino, but the 12 percent nylon might be welcome if you're a merino newbie. These are also made with plant-based dyes.

We have not tested these exact socks, but WIRED reviewers own and love several other Smartwool pairs that have stood the test of time. And yes, you really can wear them on the trail for several days in a row and they won't smell. We do suggest letting them air out each day if you can.

These minimal socks are a great choice for runners. They work especially well with barefoot shoes if that's your bag. They're 54 percent merino wool, with enough stretch to keep them nice and tight inside shoes, even when you're trail running.

Photograph: Darn Tough

My colleagues have always loved Darn Tough's merino wool socks, but senior reviewer Scott Gilbertson has never tried them until this year and… he's sold. They're great socks. These are only 60 percent merino, but that's pretty good for socks. The price dropped a bit more in our latest update. Darn Tough Socks also have a lifetime warranty.

Senior reviewer Scott Gilbertson just started testing these, as part of myhisquest for the perfect pants, but he's already a fan. He says the cotton twill is impressively heavy duty, without being too restrictive. He probably wouldn't go rock climbing in them, but they're great for hiking, especially for breaking through the dense undergrowth of the Appalachian trails he's been on lately. They're DWR coated, which he doesn't love, but it does make them water resistant.

We like a lot of Pit Viper's sunglasses. The brand is known for its neon, oversized sunnies and goggles. Styles we've tried successfully include the heart-shaped Admirers and the polarized Fondue, but there are oodles of styles to choose from. Discounts are applied automatically during checkout based on what you spend, ranging from 20 percent off to 50 percent off.

Photograph: Branwyn

We wrote a rave about how wool underwear can change your life. Merino wool is moisture-wicking, naturally odor-repellent, and shockingly good at regulating your body temperature, whether you’re really hot or really cold. Natural fibers like merino are better for the environment, for workers, and for you. Branwyn's essential bralettes and underwear are 25 percent off through November 27.

We've written about Allbirds and the company's mission to make simple shoes out of sustainable materials many times. However, the best way to experience an Allbirds is probably with a warm, wool slipper. Many of the shoes are up to 70 percent off.

Paddleboard and Kayak Deals

Photograph: Bote

The Breeze Aero (7/10, WIRED Recommends) inflatable paddleboard is well built and durable, and it packs up reasonably small. It's by far the stablest paddleboard senior reviewer Scott Gilbertson has tested, making it a good choice for beginners. It's easy to unpack and easy to use. Inflating is something of a chore with the hand pump, but once it's deflated, it's not hard to stow it away again. This deal is on the 11'6" model (which supports up to 355 pounds).

It's been a while since we tested an Oru, but every time we have we've loved them. These clever kayaks fold up like origami, packing down to the size of a small suitcase. Most weigh around 25 pounds and they're all on sale. The Beach LT is in the middle of the lineup, both in terms of size and price. It's a bit wider than some models, making it more stable and giving you a spacious cockpit that's more beginner-friendly.

This is reviews editor Adrienne So's favorite longboard, from her favorite small company, and this is an unbelievable sale. All completes are 40 percent off. She has both the Hooch and the Rum Runner and if you like downhilling or carving in long smooth stretches, there are no better boards. Check out our Best Skateboarding Gear guide for more.

Engage makes our favorite pickleball paddle for most people. For the first time ever, they're selling certified refurbs at prices up to 60 percent off. These paddles are used but come with a 60-day warranty. Of the paddles currently listed we have tested the Pursuit and liked it, though not as much as the Omega. But everything we've used from this brand inspires confidence.

Tent and Sleeping Deals

Photograph: MSR

Our favorite lightweight family backpacking tent, the MSR Elixir 4 tent isn't quite as pricey as options like the Big Agnes Copper Spur, but it's not much heavier. Senior reviewer Scott Gilbertson used this with his three kids, and there was plenty of interior space. That said, three adults will be more comfortable than four. The mesh at the top provides great ventilation on warm summer nights and the crossover pole helps it stand up well in the wind. The 1-person, 2-person, and 3-person sizes are also on sale.

Hammock Gear doesn't often go on sale, which is why this deal has got reviewer Matt Jancer excited. As a habitual hiker who's always looking to lower his pack weight, he vouches that Hammock Gear is on the top shelf in the industry for quality shelters and insulation. He used their hammock tarp most recently on a Vermont hike, and its ability to stand up to wicked strong storms impressed him. You may not know the brand name, but Hammock Gear is among ultralight outdoor gear royalty. The sale is generally sitewide, but there are some exclusions.

Our top pick for family tents, the MSR Habitude is strong and light. It fits easily on a canoe or paddleboard and is easy to set up—the design is simple and the poles are color-coded. In our testing, there was plenty of floor space for two adults, two toddlers, and a large-ish dog. It also has storage pockets, places to hang lights, and a vestibule. It doesn't have the best airflow in warmer situations, but otherwise this is a great option for families.

Unlike most of this gear, we have not tested the Aurora. However, any time you can get a Nemo tent for under $300, it's a good deal, let alone a 3-person tent. The Aurora is designed for warmer weather since it's mostly mesh, but we love stargazing out of the Nemo Dagger. Like the Dagger, this has steep sidewalls and a roomy dual vestibules (9.2 square feet on each side)

Photograph: Exped

Our favorite 4-Season Backcountry Pad, the Exped Ultra 7R is the pad to bring when you're headed out in the snow. As the name suggests, it has an R-value of 7 and it weighs under 2 pounds for the wide version. We suggest going for the wide version. We tested this pad down to 30 degrees Fahrenheit and was very comfortable (in a 20-degree bag). Exped rates it to –20 degrees Fahrenheit.

Nemo's sleeping pads are the lightest, smallest pads we've tested. The Tensor-insulated sleeping pad sports an R-Value of 4.2 and weighs just 15.2 ounces. We also love that the Tensor is thick, comfortable, and nearly silent. (Our tester hates that telltale swish of nylon that's pretty much synonymous with backcountry sleeping.) If you want the mummy version, it's also on sale at Moosejaw ($140).

We really like the slightly thicker Ultra 7R, but if you don't need extra insulation (for example if you're headed out in warmer climes), this is a good deal on a solid inflatable. As with the 7R, we suggest going for the wide version. We've found the regular to be a bit on the narrow side, and the weight difference (5 ounces) doesn't justify the lost sleeping space.

Nomadix is rotating through its best sellers, taking 25 percent off its lightweight, durable, and super-absorbent blankets and towels with bright, fun prints. This sale runs until December 13.

Everything that Yeti makes is insanely overpriced, and also the best thing we've ever touched. Reviews editor Adrienne So has owned this blanket for several years. It has a waterproof bottom, comes in its own carrying sack, is machine washable, and is weighted enough to not fly away at an outdoor concert. You can view Yeti tumblers on sale at this Amazon landing page.

This is a very nice ultralight sleeping bag. There are three temp ratings, 40 degrees, 28 degrees, and 5 degrees. Senior reviewer Scott Gilbertson tested the 5-degree bag, which kept him plenty toasty on some cool fall nights in the north woods of Wisconsin. When you want to go light this thing delivers, weighing only 12 ounces for the 40-degree version. Our female testers don't think women need a separate design, but the women's version is on sale as well.

Stove and Water Filter Deals

Firebox G2 Photograph: Amazon

Campgrounds generally have some kind of fire ring, but when senior reviewer Scott Gilbertson heads into the backcountry—if open flame fires are permitted—he's a devoted fan of Firebox stoves. He says there's nothing like cooking real food over an open flame. The Firebox is a stainless steel box you can fold up to be flat for easy packing. Most of the company's stoves are on sale right now, but he recommends the G2 for most people. If you regularly cook for larger groups, the best option is the Freestyle Everything Kit for $120 ($74 off).

The WhisperLite Universal is a legend for good reason. It'll burn just about anything (isobutane-propane, white gas, gasoline, kerosene), making it a great choice for traveling internationally or wherever you don't know what kind of fuel will be available. Flame control is a little tricky, but we have managed to get it to simmer, as long as the wind isn't too bad.

MSR's answer to the all-in-one Jetboil type of stove, the WindBurner is perfect for those solo adventures. If you end up making friends, the Windburner Duo is also on sale for $165 ($55 off).

Primus Firestick Photograph: Primus

Finding a good backpacking stove is tough. Some people skip the stove and just bring ready-to-eat food, but senior reviewer Scott Gilbertson prefers something hot. That's where the Primus Firestick comes in. It's so light and tiny, you'll never notice it in your pack, but it's plenty powerful and perfect for two-person meals. It's better at boiling (think high flame) than simmering, but when you want to go light, this is a good stove to bring. This is the lowest price we've seen on the titanium model.

This lightweight, efficient, compact stove is perfect for car camping and bike packing. We also like taking it to camping festivals. It's easy to use, and the fuel is cheap. We have seen the price dip lower, but this is still a good deal.

Want to bring a little of the camping vibe to your backyard? Grab a firepit and start roasting smores on the patio. We've tested the larger Solo Stove Yukon, which we love, but most people looking for a fire pit in their backyard should go with smaller versions like the Bonfire. These smokeless fire pits burn wood quickly, they're nearly indestructible, and they are easy to light.

MSR Guardian Photograph: REI

Fetching water for five on the trail can be a lot of work, but with MSR's Guardian filter it's as simple as scooping some water and waiting a few minutes. It's expensive, but if you backpack with a large group it's totally worth it.

This little filter lives at the bottom of senior reviewer Scott Gilbertson's daypack because it's so light. Why not? You don't have to worry about lugging a ton of water if you know that your trail crosses active streams and you have this thing with you. In fact, if you're an uber-ultralight weightist (and a little silly) you can skip the bottle entirely and just squirt this thing into your mouth while you vault across streams, sailing toward that summit.

Stasher—a perennial favorite in our Best Reusable Products guide—is 40 percent off sitewide. Probably the best way to start off with these durable, versatile bags is with this starter set that covers every need you might possibly have, from stand-up bags to one for pocket snacks.

If you hike, camp, or have a disaster kit at the ready, a LifeStraw is a good thing to include. It filters contaminated water without batteries or other accessories. Grab a BPA-free bottle to filter into and you'll get out 99.99 percent of waterborne bacteria for up to 1,000 gallons of water. By then you'll have either made it to the survivors' camp in Vermont or the zombies will have won.

Senior reviewer Scott Gilbertson got his first Petzl Tikka in 2000. It lasted 15 years and would probably still be going if he hadn't accidentally run over it. These will stand up to a lot, but not the full weight of a car, as it turns out. He's now on his second Tikka, and he says it's still the best headlamp he's ever used. Truthfully, these days he uses a USB headlamp most of the time, but when he hits the trail he still takes the Tikka and a set of extra (rechargeable) batteries.

For luxury camping trips, this is the chair to get. The Stargaze's seat swings and reclines using straps to suspend its seat from an aluminum frame. It can hold up to 300 pounds. WIRED commerce director Martin Cizmar says his only problem with the chair was that, like a palace throne, maintaining possession required constant vigilance over covetous and duplicitous vassals.

VSSL makes ultra-durable camping tools—waterproof canisters with flashlights, compasses, first aid kits, and more from a slender tube made of aircraft-grade aluminum. The Java grinder is an extension of that—a portable coffee grinder rugged enough to survive the zombie apocalypse or a bumpy ride to your favorite campsite. It's incredibly well-made, yet (relatively) lightweight. It produces a nice even grind, covering the full spectrum of brew possibilities, from French-press coarse to espresso-fine (it pairs well with the Picopresso that's also on sale).

Want some espresso in camp or on the trail? The Picopresso is the best portable espresso maker we've tried. The compact design, lightweight but solid construction, and excellent extraction results put it ahead of the rest. It consistently pulls delicious shots (once you get the grind right) with very little bitterness, and it reliably produces a nice crema no matter where you are.

Senior reviewer Scott Gilbertson loves this little coffee mug, which is nearly indestructible. It's hard to find a mug that isn't giant. If you're a fan of small mugs and need one for camping (or anywhere really) this is a great option.

The Hydro Jug Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a truly gargantuan water bottle. It may not be everyone's cup of tea—er, water—but if you struggle with staying hydrated or keeping your water bottle full, this absolute unit may be of some assistance. We've not seen the bottle sell for less.

Can't cut the cord even when you're outdoors? This Biolite power station has you covered. It's our favorite medium-capacity battery in our guide to the best portable power stations. There are recessed handles for easy carrying, a good mix of ports to charge a lot of small gadgets like phones, tablets, and laptops, and a wireless charging pad on top. The 1,521-watt-hour capacity is enough to keep you powered on a weekend camping trip. The only downside is that it does take a long time to charge.

This is our "best for laptops" pick in our Best Portable Chargers guide. It has two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and a 100-watt AC port so you can plug in a laptop charger. It fully recharged our Dell XPS 13 nearly twice in our tests.

We tested and liked the Yeti 1500X for our portable charger guide and this is roughly the same thing, just smaller capacity (think weekend gear, not backup when the grid is down). It will struggle with higher loads like power tools, but for device charging and small appliances you'll be fine. There's AC, 12V, and 60W USB-C outputs and it has a built-in solar charge controller if you have solar panels (it can charge off the wall or the car if you don't).

A 25,000-mAh battery pack that's surprisingly compact is a rarity, and this one also packs two USB-C ports, one USB-A, and the ability to draw 145 watts while charging. That means one USB-C port can dish out 100 watts, enough to fast charge a laptop. Read more in our Best Portable Chargers guide.

This is a great deal on our favorite action camera for recording your outdoor adventures. The GoPro Hero 12 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) just launched in September and the previous model is still selling for $300, which makes this a pretty sweet deal. Not only do you get the latest version, you also get two batteries and a mini tripod. The Hero 12 isn't a huge change from the Hero 11, but it does have better battery life, can shoot HDR video in 5.3K, and senior reviewer Scott Gilbertson still hasn't been able to overheat it in three months of trying. If none of that matters to you, you can grab the GoPro Hero 11 for $296 ($45 off).

WIRED reviews team director Martin Cizmar spent the summer playing pickleball to find the best paddle and this was it. The Omega Extreme X feels very precise and offers excellent ball control with a large sweet spot. You get lots of spin thanks to a durable textured carbon fiber surface. The edges are livelier than other paddles, meaning it’s more forgiving than many if you miss the sweet spot.

WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano called this her "emotional support water bottle." The Owala Freesip (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is colorful and durable, and the leak-proof lid has a straw option as well as a sip option. Sip or slurp! The choice is yours. If you're shopping at Owala, the discount will reflect in your cart. Every capacity is on sale, but prices vary by retailer and color, so double-check and compare before you purchase. The deals generally match the lowest prices we've seen.

Umbrella Deals

This is our top umbrella recommendation. It can automatically open and close with the push of a button, has sturdy fiberglass ribs and shaft, and a Teflon fabric that hasn't shown much wear after years of use.

This is our upgrade pick in our Best Umbrellas guide. Davek has a lifetime warranty for repairs and if you lose it, you can use the special code that comes in the box to redeem a replacement for up to 50 percent off the regular price. This compact umbrella is an auto-close/auto-open, and is exquisite. We like several of Davek's umbrellas, and you can use the same code for 20 percent off.

Clear umbrellas mean your vision isn't blocked when you're walking in the rain, and you also look super chic. We like this one from Shedrain—it has eight fiberglass ribs and a steel shaft. The canopy is a bit wrinkly but it holds up well against strong winds.

This is our top umbrella choice for kids, and it's a no-brainer at this price. WIRED editor Adrienne So's kids loved using it and appreciated the wooden handle. There are different prints you can choose from—this one has a canopy that changes colors.

One of our favorite barefoot shoe brands is also having a sale right now. If you're new to barefoot shoes, have a look at our Best Barefoot Shoes guide before you dive in feet first.

Once my favorite shoe (I, Scott, have since moved to the even more minimalist Z-Trek Sandal), these remain a great choice for beginners and experienced barefooters alike. Think of these as the barefoot answer to Chacos. Except where Chacos are like putting tractors on your feet, the Z-Trails still flex and bend as you walk, giving your feet the freedom of movement you expect from a barefoot shoe. The kids' Z-Trails are also a great deal at $30 ($30 off).

The HFS is our favorite barefoot shoe for running on human-made surfaces, like concrete and asphalt. It has a bit of extra cushion that's nice when you're pounding the pavement (although you shouldn't be pounding anything when running barefoot). These are comfortable and durable, and they offer about 7 millimeters of padding to soften the impact of hard surfaces.

If you want a heavier lug sole for hiking on rough ground but don't want a full boot, Xero's Mesa Trail II are a good choice. They can also double as trail runners when you want to move faster. The price varies a lot by color so it's worth clicking around. If you don't mind the red pair, they can be had for $36.

The Tari is our top pick for a solid winter boot. Senior reviewer Scott Gilbertson's daughter has worn these for two years— everywhere from the icy, windy Colorado plains to the windswept Outer Banks—and she's had toasty toes throughout. While technically a slip-on, it does have an adjustable strap that runs from the top of the arch down to the sole and then through a buckle near the back, which means you can snug it down a little if you need to. </textarea>
