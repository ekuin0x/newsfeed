                <textarea id="text" readonly> It looks like Tiffany Haddish isn’t letting her holiday hiccup—a.k.a. her DUI—arrest put a damper on her spirits.

As previously reported by The Root, the Night School star was arrested in the wee hours on Black Friday morning in Los Angeles having previously performed at the Laugh Factory in West Hollywood for the club’s 43rd annual free community Thanksgiving feast earlier that evening. At around 5:45 a.m. PT, someone alerted Beverly Hills Police Department that there was a person stopped in the middle of Beverly Drive, with the driver reportedly “slumped over the wheel” while the car was still running. When police showed up, they found Haddish and she was subsequently taken to jail without incident for suspicion of driving under the influence. She was thankfully not involved in any accident nor was she or anyone else injured.

She was released later on Friday and during a pre-scheduled stand-up performance at the Laugh Factory in Long Beach, the Girls Trip star made light of the situation when prompted by an audience member.

“I had prayed to God to send me a man with a job, career, preferably in a uniform, and I answered my prayers,” she said in audio footage captured from the event obtained by TMZ.

While it’s good to see this unfortunate incident hasn’t taken away her sense of humor, let’s hope this doesn’t turn into a repeat offense because driving under the influence is no laughing matter and shouldn’t be taken lightly under any circumstances. Here’s hoping Haddish and others don’t engage in this type of behavior again. </textarea>
