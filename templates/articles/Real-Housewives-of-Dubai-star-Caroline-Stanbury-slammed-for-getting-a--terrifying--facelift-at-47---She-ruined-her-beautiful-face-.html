                <textarea id="text" readonly> Real Housewives of Dubai star Caroline Stanbury has been brutally slammed by online trolls after sharing the results of her recent facelift.

The reality television star, 47, flaunted her new face two weeks after her shocking surgery in a post on Friday.

Many of her followers took issue with the change and left comments under her photo, claiming she had 'ruined her beautiful face'.

'The facelift doesn't look good,' one person wrote, while another added: 'I like her look before.'

Someone else commented: 'Ummm she looks terrifying now. She was already pretty like she was. I am sad about that.'

'Her mouth looks cartoon like. All that money and she ruined her beautiful face,' yet another fan said.

Others said she was too young to get a full face lift, while someone else wrote: 'Too much! Stop all the injections and plastic surgery.'

Caroline revealed last week that she had undergone her facelift in Los Angeles 'with no information whatsoever'.

Since returning back to the UK she has appeared on her podcast Uncut and Uncensored with her Spanish husband Sergio Carrallo, 29, who is 18 years her junior.

Footage shared from the podcast on their Instagram last week shows her covering up her face with huge sunglasses as she has her hood up and microphone in front of her.

The socialite admitted on the podcast: 'I decided to have a face-lift with no information whatsoever. I skipped into that surgery like I was having a mole removed.

Many of her followers took issue with the change and left vile comments under her photo, claiming she had 'ruined her beautiful face'

'This is LA â€“ so, unlike other places where you're sort of taken to hospital and feel like you're having a medical experience, here you're taken to a back room of an office just as if you're having a filler. They put you to sleep and remove your face.'

Caroline, who has three children, said of the ordeal with the unnamed doctor: 'He managed to cut off three inches on my neck and then the full width of my ear from my face.

'The shape of my face is completely wrong for a human: the top half is wider than the bottom half, and my neck is too thick. I have stitches at the front and back of my ear and on my eyelids.'

Caroline, who once dated Prince Andrew, was distraught and unrecognisable in the days following her plastic surgery, but has recently come to terms with her new appearance since healing up.
