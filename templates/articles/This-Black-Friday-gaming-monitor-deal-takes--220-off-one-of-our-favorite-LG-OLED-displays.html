This time of year presents many opportunities to make significant updates to your gaming kit without spending too much money. Gaming monitors can be particularly pricey, but you can save some cash on a number of LG gaming displays thanks to Black Friday deals. Our pick for the best gaming monitor has dropped to an all-time-low price — the LG 27GR95QE-B is $220 off and down to $780 right now.

This is a 27-inch OLED QHD display with a resolution of 1440p, 240Hz refresh rate and sub-1ms pixel response times. We have yet to see a dedicated gaming monitor that delivers better HDR performance. However, it’s worth noting that, at a maximum of around 200 nits, the display isn’t very bright.

It’s also worth bearing in mind the typical issues with OLED displays, such as potential burn-ins and text legibility. But if those aren’t a concern for you and you have the cash to spare, we highly recommend the LG 27GR95QE-B.

If you’d rather snap up a mid-range monitor, consider LG’s 27GL83A-B. That’s also available for an all-time-low price, albeit at a far more palatable $200. That’s $100 off. The 27GL83A-B is one of our favorite mid-range gaming monitors. It has a 27-inch IPS display, 165Hz refresh rate and a QHD 1440p resolution. Unless you have a high-end gaming rig (say one with a GeForce RTX 4080 or 4090 GPU), this monitor should more than do the trick.

On the downside, the power supply isn’t built into the display’s housing, so you’ll have a cumbersome power brick to deal with. Also, like most LCD displays, you won’t get true HDR here. That said, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better mid-range gaming monitor for $200.
