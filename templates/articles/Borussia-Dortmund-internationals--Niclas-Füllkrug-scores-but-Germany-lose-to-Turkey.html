Niclas Füllkrug was on target once again, but he couldn’t prevent Germany from suffering their first defeat of the Julian Nagelsmann era.

It was Niclas Füllkrug and Julian Brandt vs. Salih Özcan on Saturday evening. And the Turkey midfielder helped his team earn a 3-2 win over Germany. In what was a topsy-turvy game right from the start, Julian Nagelsmann’s side took the early lead through Kai Havertz.

Goals from Ferdi Kadioglu and Kenan Yıldız then helped Turkey turn the game on its head, before Füllkrug brought Germany back on level terms with a fantastic finish. The goal was the BVB striker’s tenth in just his 12th Germany appearance.

Özcan then came off the bench and hit the post with a fine strike from the edge of the box. But Vincenzo Montella’s side finally got the winner in the 71st minute, with Yusuf Sarı firing home from the penalty spot after Havertz handled the ball inside the box. Mats Hummels and Niklas Süle were both unused substitutes for Germany.

Donyell Malen came off the bench and helped the Netherlands beat Ireland 1-0. Wout Weghorst scored the only goal of the game in the 11th minute, as the Netherlands secured their Euro 2024 qualification.

Gregor Kobel was absent due to injury, but Switzerland claimed a 1-1 draw against Kosovo on Saturday to qualify for Euro 2024. Jamie Bynoe-Gittens came on in the 67th minute as the England U-21s beat Serbia 3-0 in the Euro U-21 qualifiers.

Julian Ryerson and Norway will not be playing in the European Championship in Germany next summer. They weren’t in action on Saturday, but their hopes of advancing to the playoffs were shattered following Romania’s 2-1 win over Israel. </textarea>
