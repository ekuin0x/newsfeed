This year, Walmart knocked it out of the park with their Black Friday deals. (Although that’s not surprising, as they are famous for their Black Friday sale.)

So we weren’t surprised to see them keep the savings coming your way with their incredible Cyber Monday deals.

As with their Black Friday deals, Walmart included savings across nearly every category. From video games and fashion to kitchen appliances and home furniture, you can snag a great deal on just about anything you want at Walmart.

Although Cyber Monday is officially over, many of Walmart’s deals are still available to shop from your computer or phone (which, by the way, you can find a replacement for at Walmart if you need it).

With the holiday season here, you can also pick up gifts for everyone on your list, and avoid overspending, if you shop at Walmart’s extended Cyber Monday sale.

Shop the best extended Cyber Monday deals below, and to make sure you don’t miss out on any savings, visit the New York Post Shopping homepage. You’ll find the latest extended Cyber Monday sales from retailers such as Amazon, Best Buy and Target, as well as deals under $50 to help you save even more money.
