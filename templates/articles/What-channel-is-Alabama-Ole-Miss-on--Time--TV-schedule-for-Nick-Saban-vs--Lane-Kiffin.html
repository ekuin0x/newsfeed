                <textarea id="text" readonly> Alabama football returns to Bryant-Denny Stadium on Saturday to begin SEC play after the Crimson Tide suffered the largest home loss under coach Nick Saban at the hands of Texas on Sept. 9.

After a lackluster offensive performance in their first road game at USF, Alabama looks to get back on track against No. 16 Ole Miss on Saturday in their 71st all-time meeting.

This marks the fourth time that Saban faces his former assistant Lane Kiffin, with Saban winning the previous three matchups. Kiffin returns to Tuscaloosa for the second time since taking over in Oxford, and looks to become the fourth assistant to beat Saban and the second one to beat him at home.

Quarterback Jalen Milroe is expected to get the start for the first time since the Texas game.
