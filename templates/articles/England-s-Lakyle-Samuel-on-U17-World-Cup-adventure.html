                <textarea id="text" readonly> The Young Lions defender looks back at their opening wins and how squad have adapted to Indonesia

England men’s under-18s captain Lakyle Samuel sat down to discuss the Young Lions’ campaign so far at the FIFA U17 World Cup in Indonesia.



Ryan Garry’s side have already secured their spot in the knock-out stages after winning both of their two group games so far, starting with



The Young Lions are now preparing to face Brazil in their final Group C match on Friday (10am GMT), before discovering who they will face in the next round.



And having been at their base camp in Jakarta for over a week now, he speaks of the squad’s ambition to go the distance.



How’s the trip been so far after a week of being here?



The travelling to get here was long, but I thought we all got through it quite well and the team have adjusted well to the time zones. We’ve adapted well to the weather and the intensity of the training has been good, especially on the hard days when we’ve all grafted so we can work well together as a team. That’s shown in the games too, because we’re here to play good football.

Lakyle Samuel in action against Iran, as England made it two wins from two at the FIFA U17 World Cup in Indonesia

Onto the football, two games in and two wins so it couldn’t have gone much better?



The first game, going into a World Cup, you can expect anything really, especially against a team we’ve never played before. But we went into it with a good mindset. We showed respect to the other team and then took our chances as well and got a good result. The second game was much tougher but I thought we did well to get over the challenges and we stopped what would create their momentum as well, which helped us a lot.



How was that Iran game? After their victory over Brazil in the first match, it gave you a real opportunity to get through with a game to spare?



In the first half, we started really well but then they got a set-piece goal. We always knew we could get back into the game, not just to draw but to go and win as well. In the second half, we dominated the ball and when we got the first goal, I just thought we had a chance to go on and win. It took a bit of magic from Joel [Ndala] with a great finish but when it went in, we just enjoyed celebrating together.



Were they a different sort of team that you’re used to facing?



Definitely. The difference between club and international level with the teams that you’re facing is really big and some teams are really direct. I felt New Caledonia were like that as well, in trying to play balls in behind us so for me as a defender, you always have to be on it and concentrated and we did that well as a team. </textarea>
