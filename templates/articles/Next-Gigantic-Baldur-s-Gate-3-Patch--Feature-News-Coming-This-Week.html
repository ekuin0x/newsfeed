                <textarea id="text" readonly> Larian Studios is set to announce details surrounding the fifth substantial patch for Baldur's Gate 3 this week as well as new features coming to the PS5 RPG. A list of changes and tweaks will be provided when the update drops, but for now, we know it'll address slowdown introduced by the game's previous patch and kissing scenes involving Astarion.

In a follow-up tweet, the Belgian developer teases a community update also set for release this week will discuss "some new features" planned for the game. Since launch, updates have been restricted to bug fixes and improvements, with very little in the way of new content besides a mirror in your camp that lets you change your appearance. A permadeath mode may be one of those new features, as a GOG achievement hints at its eventual addition.

We're aiming to release Patch 5 this week, which fixes the eternally-active acts of thefts & violence causing slowdowns, introduced in the previous patch. It also fixes Astarion's little kisses, and more! pic.twitter.com/APRAPdSouN November 27, 2023
