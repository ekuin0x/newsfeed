                <textarea id="text" readonly> Swimming Australia has published its qualification criteria for the 2024 World Championships headed to Doha, Qatar in February.

Due to the timing of the championships, Swimming Australia is unable to conduct a specific Trials meet for the occasion and will not be sending a full team to Doha. Instead, a maximum team size of 20 athletes will be selected from a targeted Australian Dolphins pool of swimmers, in a process of two phases.

Phase I Qualifying Events – 2023 World Championship Trials (Melbourne, AUS), 2023 World Championships (Fukuoka, JPN)

Phase II Qualifying Events – 2023 Pro Swim Championships (Irvine, CA, USA), 2023 World Junior Championships (Netanya, ISR), 2023 World Aquatics Swimming World Cup Series, 2023 Japan Open (Tokyo, JPN), 2023 Queensland Championships (Queensland, AUS)

Phase I athletes take priority over phase II with swimmers ranked according to the qualifying times listed below.

There are already 20 swimmers who have nailed qualification times from the World Championships; however, not all may opt to attend the competition which is set to end just 159 days before the opening of the Paris Olympic Games.

We reported how several key Aussies are indeed headed to Tokyo to race at the Japan Open, including Kyle Chalmers, Matt Temple and Elizabeth Dekkers. All 3 are among the athletes who have already punched their tickets to Doha in at least one event although Chelsea Hodges, who was absent from the World Championships due to an injury, will also be there to vie for a spot.

As for the Queensland Championships, that annual long course affair is scheduled for December 9th – December 15th which means we’ll find out the official Aussie roster for Doha shortly after then. Look for a Queensland Championships preview to be published shortly.
