                <textarea id="text" readonly> Black Friday might be over, but the luggage deals just keep coming for Cyber Monday. One of the best we’ve seen so far? Travelpro’s Platinum Elite Hardside Spinner Carry-on. From flight attendant approved-brand Travelpro, it’s sturdy, spacious enough to fit two weeks’ worth of clothes, and 20 percent off right now.

Reviewers make it out to be as high grade as its name suggests, with dozens swearing it’s “worth every penny” of the $370 price tag. Don’t worry, you won’t pay that much if you act fast on Amazon’s early Cyber Monday sale.

Right now, you can get this Amazon’s Choice luggage for $296. If you think that’s still too much, consider all the money you’ll save in baggage fees with this carry-on, whose packing capacity has been compared to a full-size suitcase.

“While this case is small in size, it utilizes every means possible to maximize your interior space,” one reviewer wrote. “I have made several trips of over a week's duration working entirely from the contents of this case. It holds more than any carry-on I've ever had.” Another shopper said it was the only bag they needed for two weeks in Costa Rica.

The suitcase measures 21 by 9.5 by 14.5 inches (23 inches tall with the wheels). The brand says it has a packing capacity of 45 liters, enough for seven to 11 outfits. Inside, there are divider panels, built-in mesh pockets, and a water-resistant pouch for optimal organization. Outside, the carry-on has a charge port compatible with USB-A and -C, as well as a TSA-friendly lock. The durable polycarbonate shell keeps your items safe as the bag (inevitably) gets jostled during transit.

“It held up through the uneven streets of Greece and Italy with ease,” said one reviewer. And a frequent flier said, “I would definitely recommend this set. I've traveled 1.5 million air miles over 30 years and I've always used Travelpro.”

Travelpro is a favorite brand among flight attendants. You’ve probably seen the cabin crew waltz onto your plane carrying the brand’s Maxlight 5 Tote or rolling the famous Flightcrew 5 bag marketed only to professionals. The Platinum Elite Hardside Spinner hasn’t had as much time to gain such a strong following. It only debuted in 2021 as a follow-up to the original Platinum Elite softside collection. Since then, it’s amassed about 800 ratings on Amazon, almost 600 of which are five-star.

The highest-rated features are maneuverability, lightness, and durability. The carry-on comes in five colors: black, silver, gray, navy, and a lighter “dark sky” blue. All are on sale for under $300 right now — so snap up the Travelpro Platinum Elite Hardside Spinner Carry-on and travel like aviation professionals this season and beyond.
