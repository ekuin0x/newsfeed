                <textarea id="text" readonly> PETAH TIKVA, ISRAEL - NOVEMBER 26: People wave flags and cheer as a second helicopter with Israeli hostages released earlier by Hamas lands at Schneider medical centre on the third day of the temporary truce where they disembarked behind screens as family and friends wait nearby on November 26, 2023 in Petah Tikva, Israel. A temporary truce between Israel and Hamas began on Friday, followed by the return of some Hamas-held hostages as well as the release of Palestinian prisoners. If the truce holds, around 50 Israeli hostages are to be released, among the approximate 240 that Israeli authorities say Hamas took captive during its Oct. 7 attack. (Photo by Alexi J.

The humanitarian truce deal that has brought a pause to the fighting in the Gaza Strip has been extended by a further two days, Qatar's ministry of foreign affairs said Monday.

Spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari did not immediately confirm the details of the deal but said in a statement earlier Monday that it could include further hostage releases and aid deliveries.

Seventeen hostages held by Hamas in Gaza were released on Sunday, including four-year-old Israeli-American Abigail Mor Edan. Israel released 39 Palestinian prisoners in return.

The first limited pause in fighting formally began on Friday, and U.S. President Joe Biden has said he hopes the current truce will be extended to allow more captives to be freed.

On Monday, Elon Musk was accompanied by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a visit to a kibbutz in southern Israel that had been attacked by Hamas militants on Oct. 7.

The Tesla CEO and owner of social media platform X, formerly Twitter, then was taken to individual families' homes to hear more personal experiences of the attacks.

Earlier this month, Musk issued a spate of bigoted tweets that spurred a backlash online. </textarea>
