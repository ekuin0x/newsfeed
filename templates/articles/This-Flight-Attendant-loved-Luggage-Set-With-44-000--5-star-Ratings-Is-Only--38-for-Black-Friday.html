                <textarea id="text" readonly> No one knows good luggage more than someone who practically lives out of their suitcase. Flight attendants spend much of their lives schlepping bags through airports, smooshing them into overhead bins, rolling them across rough pavement, packing them, unpacking them, and repacking them for the next trip.

Needless to say, they catch on quickly to every minute annoyance, be it a flimsy zipper or poorly placed compartment. This Rockland Two-piece Luggage Set is one among a limited number that have passed their rigorous tests — and it’s currently just $38 for Black Friday.

Right now, you can get the flight attendant-approved carry-on and personal item for a whopping 60 percent off the $95 list price. Airline workers who have reviewed the set on Amazon say they’re “impressed” with the quality of the bags given their surprisingly low price.

“I travel roughly five to six days a week, and have had this set for about five months,” one wrote. “In and out of countless planes, vans, and cargo holds. The wheels and handle still work great” even after being put through the “ultimate test.” The reviewer did say that the bags were beginning to show some wear such as pulling seams and the Rockland logo popping off. Still, they recommend it to the “average traveler who doesn't need to spend money on a heavy-duty set.”

The larger bag is a 20-inch by 13-inch by 7.5-inch upright carry-on that stands on two inline skate-type wheels (i.e., no spinners). It opens to a spacious interior complete with a small mesh zipper compartment and two straps for securing clothes. There are two additional zipper pockets on the front of the bag as well.

The matching tote bag measures 13.5 inches by 11 inches by 5 inches, which meets the requirements for a personal item on most airlines. It features a front pocket in addition to the main compartment, handles, and a detachable shoulder strap. According to another flight attendant, ​​the tote “has enough space without being too bulky, and the larger carry-on bag fits everything [they] need for a week or more.”

The set comes in a multitude of colors and patterns, from classic black to bold yellow to camo or plaid print. Prices vary depending on the set but range from $34 to $49; the best deal is on the charcoal set.

The Rockland Softside Two-piece Luggage Set has received about 65,000 ratings at Amazon, and more than 43,000 of them are five-star. Reviewers admit it doesn’t match the durability of top brands, but they give it great marks for being budget-friendly and lightweight. A deal like this only comes around once in a blue moon (or, more accurately, once annually around Black Friday).
