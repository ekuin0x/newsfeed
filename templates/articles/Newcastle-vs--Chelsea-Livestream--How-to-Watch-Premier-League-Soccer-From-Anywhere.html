                <textarea id="text" readonly> Two sides desperately looking to improve their midtable standings in the English Premier League go head to head on Saturday as Newcastle host Chelsea.

Injury-hit Newcastle went into the international break after a demoralizing defeat to struggling Bournemouth -- a result that brought an end to their seven-game unbeaten league run and saw them slip down to seventh in the table.

Meanwhile, Chelsea will be looking to continue their recent turnaround after claiming a dramatic win over Spurs and an equally thrilling draw against defending champs Man City.

Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services for watching all of the action live wherever you are in the world.

Newcastle United vs. Chelsea: When and where?



Newcastle host Chelsea at St. James' Park on Saturday, Nov. 25. Kickoff is set for 3 p.m. GMT (10 a.m. ET, 7 a.m. PT, 2 a.m. AEDT).

How to watch the Newcastle vs. Chelsea game online from anywhere using a VPN

If you're unable to view the game locally, you may need a different way to watch -- and that's where a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's a great idea if you want an extra layer of privacy for your devices and log-ins while you're traveling and connecting to Wi-Fi networks.

With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier sticks you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, non-blackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.

Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it thinks is circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.

Looking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now.

Saturday's Newcastle vs. Chelsea match is streaming on Peacock. You'll need a Peacock Premium or Premium Plus account to catch the game live.

Peacock Watch the EPL in the US from $6 per month NBC's streaming service, Peacock, offers access to all the matches of this season's Premier League that aren't shown on cable. You'll need to have a Peacock Premium or Premium Plus account to stream games live, which costs $6 a month or $60 per year. See at Peacock

Can I livestream the Newcastle vs. Chelsea game in the UK?

No broadcaster has the rights to show this game live in the UK, due to the traditional Saturday 3 p.m. kickoff blackout, which prohibits matches being shown in the region at that time in order to protect attendance throughout the English football pyramid.

That also means that if you're in the UK while traveling, you're unlikely to be able to watch the game as you normally would at home thanks to geo-blocking.

There is one option to get around this, however. By using a VPN, as explained above, you can set your location to a country where the match is being broadcast and go from there.
