                <textarea id="text" readonly> With key sales going live this weekend, there's no better time than now to secure that PS5 Cyber Monday deal. PlayStation Black Friday sales will extend into this weekend, but Cyber Monday is the new term you'll need to get comfortable with for the next few days. Amazon already has its Cyber Monday sale live, with Walmart and Best Buy following up tomorrow. Just so aware, any of the discounts we are mentioning here will expire on November 27 at 11:59 PM PT -- so there's a limited time left to snag these bargains.

By far the most popular PS5 deal going into the Cyber Monday weekend is the Spider-Man 2 slim model bundle. It's down to $499 and includes Insomniac's next entry into its Spidey saga at no extra cost. We gave Spider-Man 2 a great 8/10 in our review - stating: "Marvel's Spider-Man 2 delivers Insomniac's best tale yet, and despite its open world falling short, is a reliably fun superhero power trip."

If you're not keen on Spidey, then we've got some good news. The next best bundle also costs $499 and includes the new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 at no extra cost. That's another excellent deal, and well worth considering as a gift for any keen FPS fan who hasn't yet upgraded to a PS5.

Remember, if you don't want either game included in the bundles, you can also just sell on the digital code for additional savings. However, if you're looking for more deals on Call of Duty products, head over to the IGN Store to see our Call of Duty collection.

But we still hear one big question every time we talk about it: what about PS5 slim digital? Well, we can now answer that, as it's now available to buy for $449.99. There's no preorder period or chasing down stock, it's just available - huzzah! There aren't any special digital PS5 Black Friday bundles out at the time of writing, so there's no free game unlike the PS5 slim disc version -- but that's still an option if you are 100% digital as those games are digital copies as well.
