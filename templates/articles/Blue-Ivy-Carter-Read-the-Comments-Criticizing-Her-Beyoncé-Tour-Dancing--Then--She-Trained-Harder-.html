                <textarea id="text" readonly> Blue Ivy Carter saw the comments calling her dancing on her mom Beyoncé’s Renaissance World Tour lackluster. But rather than stop making appearances during the songs “My Power” and “Black Parade,” The New York Times reported, in its recent review of Bey’s concert film, that the 11-year-old simply tried harder.

Beyoncé had been hesitant for Blue to perform with her, the Times wrote. Blue making a guest appearance as a dancer was supposed to be a one-off, and Bey wasn’t even sure that was a good idea. “She told me she was ready to perform, and I told her no,” Beyoncé said in the film, per the outlet.

But Blue convinced her to let her go on stage. Beyoncé later became “dismayed” when she learned that her daughter had read social media comments criticizing her dancing. It ultimately “thrilled” Beyoncé to see that, instead of quitting, Blue “put in the work and train even harder for future stops,” the outlet wrote.

The New York Times also applauded Blue for her role in the concert film. She appears in a lot of the behind-the-scene footage, the outlet revealed, and gave “her often unsugarcoated opinion on stage design, song choices and more. In a film where everyone else treats Beyoncé as a boss or a goddess, Blue Ivy is an amusingly irreverent presence.”

Beyoncé offered her own praise during the tour in an Instagram post with a very rare caption. (Bey publishes the majority of her photos without any commentary.)

“My beautiful first born 🙏🏾,” she wrote on May 29. “I’m so proud and thankful to be your mama. You bring us so much joy, my sweet angel.”
