                <textarea id="text" readonly> The moment a Rubik’s-cube-loving boy who spent his ninth birthday as a hostage in Gaza was freed from captivity on the first day of a four-day truce and prisoner exchange has been captured on video.

Footage released by the Schneider children’s medical centre showed Ohad Munder running through a hospital corridor into his father’s arms as the pair were reunited after almost 50 days without any contact.

He was among four children freed on Friday. Gilat Livni, the centre’s director of pediatrics, told reporters the children were all in a relatively good state. Some spoke of what they had been through, she said but declined to provide further details.

“They shared experiences. We were up with them until late at night and it was interesting, upsetting and moving,” said Livni.

More of Ohad’s relatives said they could not wait to be reunited with him.

“I’m waiting to see Ohad and can’t wait to give him his Rubik’s cube, which I know he really loved and he probably missed it so much,” said his 27-year-old cousin, Roni Haviv, as she watched footage of Ohad being handed over by Hamas fighters to Red Cross staff.

“That’s the first thing he takes everywhere he goes,” she added.

Hospital photos later showed Ohad playing with a Rubik’s cube and blowing bubbles.

Ohad’s father said the boy’s mother, Keren, 54, and grandmother Ruth, 78, were all fine and healthy but that his grandfather, 78-year-old Avraham Munder, remained in captivity in Gaza.

The 13 Israeli hostages released by Hamas fighters included sisters aged two and four and their mother; a five-year-old girl and her mother; as well as elderly women. They were among about 240 people abducted by Hamas gunmen who rampaged through southern Israel on 7 October.

In addition, 10 Thai hostages and one Filipino who were taken captive at the same time were also freed under a separate agreement, Qatari mediators said.

After their release, the hostages underwent initial medical checks and were then reunited with their families.

Yosef Mendelovich, associate director of Israel’s ministry of health, said: “We’ve all anxiously awaited their return and are elated to see the day that they have come home to us.”

The rest of a group of at least 50 Israeli hostages due to be exchanged under a Qatari-brokered agreement are expected to be freed in the coming days, and more hostages could be added if the truce deal is extended.

Egyptian security sources said they had received the names of 14 Israeli women and children from Hamas to be released on Saturday and were waiting for more details on when the hostages would be handed over to Egyptian authorities. </textarea>
