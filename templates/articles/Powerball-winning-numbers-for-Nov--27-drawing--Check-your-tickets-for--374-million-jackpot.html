                <textarea id="text" readonly> The Powerball jackpot for the next drawing on Wednesday is now worth an estimated $374 million after no winner was produced in Monday's drawing.

The numbers were chosen just after 11 p.m. ET Monday, and we have the results below.

If there is a winner on Wednesday and they choose the cash option, they could now go home with more than $173.5 million, according to the lottery.

Here are the winning numbers for the Nov. 27 drawing.

Powerball winning numbers: 11/27/2023

The winning numbers for Monday night's drawing were 2, 21, 38, 61 and 66. The Powerball was 12, and the Power Play was 2X.

Winning lottery numbers are sponsored by Jackpocket, the official digital lottery courier of the USA TODAY network.

Did anyone win the Powerball last night?

In addition to no jackpot winners, the Powerball also reported no Match 5 + Power Play $2 million winners or Match 5 $1 million winners.

What are the odds of winning the Powerball?

It's understandable that some lottery players are enticed by the whopping $374 million jackpot, but it's essential to keep in mind that the chances of winning Powerball's top prize are exceedingly slim.

The odds of winning a Powerball jackpot are about 1 in 292.2 million.

The overall odds of winning a Powerball prize (across all tiers) are about 1 in 24.9.

To participate in the Powerball game, players can purchase a ticket for $2 per play. The game requires players to choose five numbers from one to 69 for the white balls, and one number from one to 26 for the red Powerball. Alternatively, players can opt to receive random numbers.

In order to win the jackpot, it is necessary to match the numbers for all of the five white balls and the red Powerball.

In addition to the grand prize, Powerball offers eight other ways to win based on the number of matched balls in the non-jackpot tiers.

The non-jackpot prizes offered range from $4 to $1 million. By paying an additional $1, you can choose to participate in "Powerplay" that increases non-jackpot winnings by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 times.

According to Powerball, the 10X Powerplay option is exclusively applicable to jackpots worth $150 million or less. Additionally, the game's "Match 5" prize for the second-tier is limited to a maximum of $2 million if the Powerplay feature is utilized.

An additional add-on feature called "Double Play," which gives players another chance to match their numbers after each Powerball drawing, is available in some jurisdictions for $1 per play.
