                <textarea id="text" readonly> SpaceX made its most important hire in 2002 when Gwynne Shotwell joined as vice president of business development. Shotwell is a former high school cheerleader who is trained as an engineer but lacks their nerdiness, instead she has been described as smooth and well-spoken. She is a trusted Musk advisor who can speak honestly without annoying Musk. Shotwell oversees SpaceX’s day-to-day as president and COO. Mark Juncosa, another Musk lieutenant, was previously in charge of Starlink, the satellite internet constellation that is expected to go public. Last year, Shotwell and Juncosa were put in charge of overseeing the facility and operations of Starbase, one of four active SpaceX launch sites. On the SpaceX board you’ll find Antonio Gracias, a long-time friend and confidant of Musk’s (Gracias stepped down from the Tesla board in 2021). His growth firm, Valor Equity partners, has invested in many Musk companies including SpaceX, Tesla, the Boring Company, and Neuralink. Here’s a look at the top execs redefining space exploration at SpaceX.
