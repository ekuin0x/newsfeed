                <textarea id="text" readonly> Auburn was one play away from defeating Alabama for the first time since 2019, but instead suffered its second straight heartbreaking defeat to the Tide at Jordan-Hare Stadium, falling 27-24.

Payton Thorne completed five passes for 91 yards, with a touchdown and an interception. Of Thorne's five completions, four were to Ja'Varrius Johnson. Johnson finished the game with 76 yards receiving. Despite the struggles passing the ball, Auburn had success on the ground, rushing for 244 yards on 42 carries. Jarquez Hunter ran for 93 yards, while Damari Alston added 85 rush yards.

The Auburn defense struggled to get pressure and contain Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe, who was 16-of-24 for 259 yards and two scores. Milroe also led the Tide in rushing, with 107 yards. Isaiah Bond led the Crimson Tide in receiving, catching five passes for 75 yards. Bond had the winning touchdown reception on fourth-and-31 with 32 seconds remaining.

Jalen McLeod led the Auburn defense with eight tackles. Auburn struggled mightily and third-down and fourth-down situations in long yardage. Alabama was 6-of-17 on third down and 2-of-2 on fourth down, with both fourth-down conversions coming on the final drive. Of Alabama's six third-down conversions, the Crimson Tide gained six or more yards on four of them. In addition, Alabama gained 19 yards on third-and-20 on its final drive, putting the Tide in position to convert the first of two fourth downs.

Auburn's class of four-year seniors became the first class to play Alabama and Georgia at least four times each and fail to defeat either of Auburn's rivals. Auburn will fight to finish above .500 for the first time since 2020 in its bowl game, which will be announced on Sunday, Dec. 3.

Here is how social media reacted to Auburn's devastating loss. </textarea>
