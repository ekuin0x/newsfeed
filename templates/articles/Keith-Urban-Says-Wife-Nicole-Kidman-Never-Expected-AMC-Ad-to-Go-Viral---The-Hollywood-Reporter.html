                <textarea id="text" readonly> Keith Urban has revealed why Nicole Kidman initially decided to team up with AMC Theatres for an ad that unexpectedly became a cultural moment.

During an appearance on a recent episode of Criss Angel’s Talking Junkies podcast, the country singer opened up about his wife’s viral commercial for the company in 2021.

“She did it because she loves movies, we love movies. And it was hard times for the theaters,” Urban said, referring to the struggles theaters faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. “So AMC asked her if she’d do an AMC commercial, and it was a no-brainer for her to be a part of that, never in a million years expecting that to be this cultural thing.”

In the ad spot, Kidman is seen walking into an AMC theater after it’s been raining, saying, “We come to this place for magic.”

As she sat down in a theater seat, the actress continued, “We come to AMC Theatres to laugh, to cry, to care, because we need that, all of us. That indescribable feeling we get when the lights begin to dim and we go somewhere we’ve never been before — not just entertained but somehow reborn, together.”

After the commercial became such a big hit, some people even took to social media to recreate the ad, as well as dressed up in a Kidman-inspired costume for Halloween.

The actress previously told GQ in 2022 that she “can’t tell you why it worked or why it’s gone viral. But what I can tell you is that the reaction is a direct result of the amount of people going back to theaters to enjoy the movies. And that is exciting.” </textarea>
