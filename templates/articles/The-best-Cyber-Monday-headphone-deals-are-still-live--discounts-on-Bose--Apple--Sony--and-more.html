UPDATE: Nov. 28, 2023, 10:40 a.m. EST This story has been updated with the best Cyber Week headphone and speaker deals that are still live.

These days, you may be able to buy anything under the sun during Cyber Monday, but the shopping holiday remains one of the best times of year to pick up a brand-new pair of headphones or earbuds at a steep discount.

Whether you're looking for premium active noise-cancellation workhorses or earbuds to wear while working out, you have a lot of options. Searching for the best deals can be a full job in itself â€” which is why we've made it our job. We're scouring the best deals from the biggest retailers (like Amazon and Best Buy) and the biggest brands (like Sony, Bose, and Beats), making sure that if there's a headphone deal worth hearing about, we've got it on our list.

Below, we've gathered up the best Cyber Week headphone, earbud, and speaker/soundbar deals that are still live. Check out some of our top picks:

Note: All newly added deals are marked with a âœ¨, while deals with a ðŸ”¥ have dropped to an all-time low price. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.

Best headphones deal

Why we like it

When it comes to headphone deals, you'll have plenty of options this Cyber Monday, especially when it comes to Bose headphones: The new QuietComfort Ultra headphones got their first markdown, the Bose 700 headphones are at a record-low price for anyone looking for 10 customizable levels of ANC, and the latest standard headphones in the QuietComfort line are also on sale for the first time. But there's only one pair of Bose over-ear headphones you can grab for just under $200, and that's the QuietComfort 45s. Down to a new record low of $199 at Amazon, Best Buy, and the Bose website, you'll get top-of-the-line ANC, 20 hours of battery life, and comfort that allows for all-day wear for less than half the price of a pair of Apple AirPods Max.

Best earbuds deal

Why we like it

Apple's 2nd-generation AirPods Pro with the Lightning Charging Case sold out at Walmart after it marked them down to $169 for Black Friday (a new record-low), but that's not a huge loss: The newer USB-C ones are also on sale, and they're more future-proof. No need to upgrade if you already have the Lightning version, but for anyone "just looking for a pair of earbuds with good sound and great noise cancellation, alongside some unique smart features, the AirPods Pro are a great buy," writes Mashable senior editor Stan Schroeder.
