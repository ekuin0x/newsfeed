Someone forgot to tell Max Homa about the learning curve that usually exists when transitioning into a new golf ball. It’s supposed to take time to completely trust something different, especially in a competitive setting.

In Homa’s case, he switched from Titleist’s 2021 Pro V1 into the 2023 version and didn’t skip a beat, gaining a combined 10 strokes on the field, in Strokes Gained, en route to the 6th PGA Tour win of his career at the Farmers Insurance Open.

“Ball changes are hard because I always have to ask [Titleist Tour rep J.J. Van Wezenbeeck] what is [the new ball] supposed to do differently because I wouldn’t be able to notice,” Homa said on GOLF’s Fully Equipped podcast. “I feel like there’s such a fine line when you’re switching within the same model. I’d notice if I switched to a different model completely.”

Coming off a season where he won twice, Homa was in no rush to switch balls. During testing at the Titleist Performance Institute the week prior to the Torrey Pines, Homa received his first look at the 2023 Pro V1. For the most part, the new version wasn’t all that different from the 2019 version he was already playing. According to Homa, it had the same feel with the short irons, around the green and with the putter.

But as Homa continued to move up his iron set, he saw improvements that stood out. While the spin initially dropped when he hit the 4- and 6-iron — something most pros don’t want to see with the long irons — any fears were allayed as Homa attempted to hoist the ball into the stratosphere.

“I could see [J.J.] and [my coach Mark Blackburn] were a little concerned [with the spin],” Homa said. “Then they asked me to try and hit one really high, and once I showed them I could do that, they were good.”

Having the ability to vary the flight on command would turn out to be important as Homa navigated his way around Torrey. Before he stepped foot on the grounds to compete, he made a trip with caddie Joe Greiner and a couple of friends to Rancho Santa Fe Country Club to play 9 holes and see how the gear held up.

“I wasn’t really thinking much about the golf ball until I got to 8,” Homa recalled. “I had 230 yards way up a hill to a front pin and hit this big, high 4-iron that stopped really fast. I looked at [my caddie Joe Greiner] and said, ‘Oh, OK!” That was kind of the first test for me. I called J.J. and said, ‘I’m going to use the golf ball.'”

The single 4-iron shot would seal the deal on Homa playing 2023 Pro V1 during the event. What Homa didn’t realize was how important the 4-iron and new ball would be down the stretch on Sunday as he pulled off two critically important shots on the back nine with the tournament in the balance.

“Lo and behold, I hit two of the best 4-iron of my life on 11 and 16 during the final round,” he said. “I didn’t think of it while I was playing, but when I was done, I was like, dang that’s pretty ironic and cool. I threw it as high as I could on 11. And then on 16, I wanted it to be kinda flat to get through the wind.”

Having the ability to trust the gear in the bag is paramount for any Tour pro. For Homa, being able to do it in the heat of the battle with something brand-new validated his decision to switch. It also confirmed his belief that the new ball was better than what he’d previously had in play.

The proof is in the hardware (and check) Homa took home.
