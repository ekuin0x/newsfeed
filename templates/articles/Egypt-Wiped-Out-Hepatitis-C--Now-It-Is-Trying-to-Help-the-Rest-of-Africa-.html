                <textarea id="text" readonly> Most of the new treatment sites were teaching hospitals in regional centers, but she insisted on a pilot project at a rural hospital in an isolated region in the north, knowing that if Ghana was to truly wipe out the disease, frontline staff would have to be the ones to provide the treatment. The rural site had patients screened, tested and enrolled within a week.

Testing remained a problem: only private laboratories offered the viral load tests that are necessary to track hepatitis treatment, and they charged several hundred dollars per test. Dr. Nartey has 340 patients enrolled for potential treatment, but only 290 of them have been able to raise the funds for the viral load test they need to start. The new hepatitis program negotiated a lower rate, promising a steady flow of patients, but at about $80 per test, it remains the biggest challenge to the program.

For patients who had been living with not only the financial cost of the disease but also anxiety and fear as they saw relatives die of liver disease, the news of free treatment was almost unbelievable.

Mr. Musah first began to feel ill as a high school student living in a small town in the north. The hospital near his home couldn’t explain his back pain and feverish nights, and tested for everything from a dairy allergy to syphilis to H.I.V. After hundreds of dollars in tests, he was finally given a hepatitis diagnosis — but was told he would need a specialty hospital to help him. He traveled to Accra, where doctors said there were drugs, but he would have to pay for them. </textarea>
