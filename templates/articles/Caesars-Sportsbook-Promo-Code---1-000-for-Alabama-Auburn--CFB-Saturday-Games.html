Best College Football Bets on Saturday Night

There have been many exciting outcomes in the Iron Bowl. But I doubt this game is very close this year. The Crimson Tide opened as a 10.5-point favorite, and that spread is now at -14. I’m taking Bama to cover the big spread. They will dominate on the road and find their way into the College Football Playoff.

Florida State is now just a 6.5-point favorite against Florida. That has a lot to do with the absence of Jordan Travis, but I still like the Seminoles to cover the spread. It will be the second start for Tate Rodemaker. I’m also taking No. 4 Washington to take care of business against Washington State. It’s another large spread, but I doubt they have any problems with their eyes on the CFP.
