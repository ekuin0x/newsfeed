                <textarea id="text" readonly> From 1h ago 21.02 GMT IDF: 11 freed hostages 'now in Israel' The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) says all 11 hostages released by Hamas on Monday are now in Israel, Reuters is reporting. All 11 are Israeli citizens, the IDF said, and several children with the same last names are among them. The IDF named the 11 released today as Eitan Yahalomi, Sharon Kunio, three-year-old twins Emma and Yuly Kunio, Karina Enge, Mike Engel, Yuval Engel, Sahar Kalderon, Erez Kalderon, Or Yaakov and Yagil Yaakov. The children’s ages range from three to 18, CNN reports.

9m ago 22.07 GMT Edward Helmore New York peace activists calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza staged their most dramatic action to date on Sunday, closing down the Manhattan Bridge for three hours as people were returning from the Thanksgiving break. Organizers with the anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice For Peace (JVP) estimate more than 1,500 protesters blocked traffic on the bridge connecting lower Manhattan to Brooklyn as they chanted “let Gaza live” and other messages calling for a permanent ceasefire in the Palestinian territory where Israel and Hamas have warred since October. The demonstration came on one of the heaviest travel days of the year. And it followed a series of orchestrated pro-ceasefire disruptions, including sit-ins at Grand Central station and marches timed to snarl traffic and maximize commuter disruption.

Photograph: Thalia Juarez/The Guardian “We know that business-as-usual can’t continue while the US government is continuing to fund and fuel genocidal attacks against the Palestinians of Gaza,” a JVP spokesperson, Jay Saper, told the Guardian on Monday. We know that taking mass action is necessary to help build international outcry that can stop the bombings permanently. Saper said that Monday’s announced, two-day extension of a pause in Israeli military action was a sign that mass protests in US cities and western capitals had been effective. The protest on Sunday had been an interfaith action that included rabbis, pastors, imams and Palestinians who had joined Jewish New Yorkers at the bridge crossing. The civic protests had made it impossible for the US government to ignore polling that showed a majority of Americans want a permanent ceasefire, Saper added.

1h ago 20.58 GMT Three-year-old twins among latest released hostages: report Three-year-old twins are among several children released by Hamas on Monday, the BBC is reporting, citing an Israeli government spokesperson. Mark Regev told the BBC News Channel they were transferred to the International Red Cross on Monday evening. “We are waiting for them to be back on Israeli soil. Only when they are back at home can we say this has truly been done. We think it’s just a matter of time now,” the network reported him as saying. Regev added that Israel’s “framework” from the beginning was for 50 women and children to be freed over four days. “We saw the sort of violence [Hamas] committed against innocent civilians on 7 October, and just tonight, the people released, there are three-year-old twins. Who kidnaps three-year-olds?” Regev told the BBC.

1h ago 20.48 GMT White House: US working hard 'to keep flow of hostages going' The US is “working very, very hard to keep this flow of hostages going”, according to national security spokesperson John Kirby. He’s just been on CNN, speaking about Monday’s release of 11 more hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and how he expects the upcoming days to play out: We’re glad to see that there’s a two-day extension [to the temporary truce with Israel]. And we certainly would hope that in the next two days, in this next couple of installments, that we’ll see some Americans coming out. But it’s difficult to know for sure, day to day, exactly how Hamas is making these decisions. I would remind that the test pilot for this whole program was two Americans, a mother and daughter, several weeks ago, and of course, we were able to get Abigail Edan out over the weekend. So that’s promising, but we’re just going to have to keep at it. Officials believe up to nine Americans are still being held by Hamas. Kirby said: It could be as few as seven, it could be eight or nine left, we don’t have an exact figure. But we will. We believe that the majority of the ones that are left and, we believe, held hostage, are males. And right now Hamas is only willing to release women and children. So it could be some time here before we can start to see progress on the other hostages.
