                <textarea id="text" readonly> Taylor Swift

An epic Taylor Swift-inspired display of Christmas lights has made its way across social mediaâ€”and Swifties are obsessed.

In a TikTok video shared by @deborahnilles, viewers get a close-up look at a house in Naperville, Ill., that pays tribute to the pop star's Eras Tour. The clipâ€”appropriately set to Swift's song, "ME!" featuring Panic! at the Discos's Brendon Urieâ€”shows a home with a dazzling assortment of rainbow-colored lights and homemade displays.

One display features the likeness of Swift's boyfriend, Travis Kelce, in his #87 Kansas City Chiefs uniform. The football player holds up a neon sign that reads, "(taylor's version)" next to an NFL emblem that says, "Karma is the guy on the Chiefs."

Another highlight of the display include giant versions of Swift's album covers (also her "eras") including: her self-titled album, Speak Now, Fearless, 1989, Reputation, Lover, Folklore, Evermore and Midnights. The corresponding lights in each section matched its era.

Additionally, the official Eras Tour artwork showing Swift in her nine eras takes up the entire right side of the house.

Elsewhere in the elaborate display is a giant cardboard cutout of Taylor Swift herself, a neon sign that says, "Merry Swiftmas!" Swift's "A LOT GOING ON AT THE MOMENT" T-shirt, giant friendship bracelets wrapped around a tree and more.

In the comments, a TikTok user named Becca shared, "this is my house! we made almost everything!" To that, the OP replied, "Becca I love it! And here I thought you could never top Candy Land!! Merry Christmas!" (Evidently, this house goes all-in for a different theme each year.)

"you win Christmas," another TikTok user declared.

"I wish I could go see this in person!! ðŸ¥°" someone else commented.

Someone else wrote, "ðŸ¥° This is what the inside of my brain looks like this year!"

Hopefully, this Naperville house leaves its Christmas lights up 'til January!
