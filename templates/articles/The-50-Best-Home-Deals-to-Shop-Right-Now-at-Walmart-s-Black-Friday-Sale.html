                <textarea id="text" readonly> It’s officially time to shop and save—a lot. Walmart’s Black Friday deals have arrived right on cue, and thousands of impressive markdowns are worth perusing. We did the brunt work for you and found 50 top-notch discounts to add to your cart ASAP.

Throughout the sale weekend, deals go in and out of stock quickly, so be sure to shop sooner rather than later to secure your must-haves. Save big on furniture, decor, kitchen appliances, patio finds, and more from Staub, Henckels, Le Creuset, and KitchenAid for up to 78% off.

Best Overall Walmart Black Friday Deals

Check everything off your shopping list during Walmart’s Black Friday sale, which has pieces to update your indoor and outdoor spaces. At the top of our list right now: the KitchenAid Tilt-Head Stand Mixer, a Le Creuset Signature Oval Dutch Oven, a Ring Doorbell Plus, and this rustic barn door TV stand.

Best Walmart Black Friday Furniture Deals

Walmart

Whether you just moved into a new space or are looking to replace some of your outdated furniture with new pieces, Walmart has thousands of can’t-miss styles marked down. Since mounting a TV on the wall can be a tough job (and a permanent one), opt for a TV stand like this Modern Farmhouse style or this cozy electric fireplace that’s $250 off and can heat up to 400 square feet.

Best Walmart Black Friday Decor Deals

Walmart

To make your space feel more personal, touches of decor like an area rug or an artificial silk plant will elevate any room with a pop of color and pattern. Make your space feel larger with a new mirror, and Walmart has a variety marked down for Black Friday. This full-length arched style is simple and minimal, while this wavy wall mirror will brighten up neutral-colored walls. For a mirror with storage, this jewelry armoire features a lockable cabinet that can house up to 90 rings, 42 pairs of earrings, 30 necklaces, and a bar for bracelets.

Best Walmart Black Friday Kitchen Deals

Walmart

We’re impressed with Walmart’s kitchen deals like this Henckels 14-Piece Self-Sharpening Knife Set up to 78% off, Staub’s Cast Iron 5-Quart Cocotte for 60% off, and this KitchenAid Deluxe Tilt-Head Stand Mixer that’s $141 off. There’s no better time to score major savings on top brands like Le Creuset, Staub, and Ninja.

Best Walmart Black Friday Patio Deals

Walmart

While you’re busy updating your interior with new decor, kitchen appliances, and furniture, don’t neglect your backyard as a result. Tons of patio furniture like this four-piece rattan set, folding Adirondack chair, and wicker hanging egg chair are fun additions to your deck for additional seating options. Finish off the space with a waterproof area rug and waterproof solar lanterns to brighten pathways at night.

Best Walmart Black Friday Home Tech Deals

Walmart

Keep your home safe with deals on security tech like a Ring video doorbell, motion sensor outdoor lights, and a wireless camera to keep an eye on your pet. For an affordable surveillance camera, both the Roku Smart Home Indoor Camera and the Plusbravo Night Vision Camera are now $18. A cost-saving option that’s also marked down is the Anran Solar Security Camera, which offers panoramic views and a smart siren alarm feature.
