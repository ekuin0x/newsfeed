                <textarea id="text" readonly> Sarah Jessica Parker reunited with her husband Matthew Broderick in California over Thanksgiving break, and the married couple of 26 years posed for a rare snap with their 21-year-old son James and 14-year-old twin daughters Tabitha and Marion.

The cozy selfie was included in James Wilkie Broderick's slideshow he posted on Sunday for the viewing pleasure of his 23,500 Instagram followers.

The Brown University sophomore - who's studying the classics and classical languages, literatures, and linguistics - shared a snap of what appeared to be his 61-year-old father's rental property in Orange County.

James - who works as a sales associate at Reiss when he's in Manhattan - also showed off his biceps in a LA Lakers jersey while cheering for the home team inside Crypto.com Arena.

Broderick captioned his post 'Cheers, California' and his parents' colleague Julie Halston commented: 'Loved having you here!'

Wow! Sarah Jessica Parker reunited with her husband Matthew Broderick in California over Thanksgiving break, and the married couple of 26 years posed for a rare snap with their 21-year-old son James and 14-year-old twin daughters Tabitha and Marion

Growing up: The cozy selfie was included in James Wilkie Broderick's slideshow he posted on Sunday for the viewing pleasure of his 23,500 Instagram followers

The 68-year-old comedian famously played socialite Bitsy von Muffling opposite the 58-year-old Emmy winner in HBO's Sex and The City and Max's continuation And Just Like That.

Julie currently portrays five different characters opposite Matthew's George Babbitt in La Jolla Playhouse's world premiere of Babbitt.

Tony Award-winning playwright Joe DiPietro adapted Sinclair Lewis' 1922 novel and Christopher Ashley directed the sold-out social satire, which runs through December 10 at the Mandell Weiss Theatre.

And on December 4, the two-time Tony winner will join Ellie Kemper for a $250/ticket, one-night-only staged reading of A.R. Gurney's Love Letters to benefit La Jolla Playhouse's new work development and learning programs.

'Very recently I've tried [acting] out. Really liked it, so that would be great,' James told ET in June of following in his folks' footsteps.

'But I have, like, a lot of things that could work out so I'm not, like, super worried about it. I'm still in college...right now I have time to try things out, but when I get back to school, I won't have a lot of time to, like, do other stuff because it's hard.'

Broderick continued: 'I got a job in a clothing store. I need money. I need a job. I need to wake up on time. I used to think I was a better writer until I went to a good college and I started getting Bs.'

Sarah and Matthew will then bring their $26.4M-grossing Broadway revival of Neil Simon comedy Plaza Suite to the West End from January 17-March 31 at London's Savoy Theatre.

'I admire her so much,' the Painkiller star gushed to The Guardian in August.

'Never mind personally – loving her and all that – but I admire her acting, too. Sarah started her career on the stage as well. So she's great at handling an audience. She's as sharp as can be. She's got real chops.'

Nice! The Brown University sophomore - who's studying the classics and classical languages, literatures, and linguistics - shared a snap of what appeared to be his 61-year-old father's rental property in Orange County
