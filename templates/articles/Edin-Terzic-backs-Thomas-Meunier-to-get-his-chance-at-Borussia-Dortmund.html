                <textarea id="text" readonly> Edin Terzic is backing Thomas Meunier to get his opportunity at Borussia Dortmund, even though he hasn’t played for the first-team since March.

Things have certainly not gone according to plan for Thomas Meunier since his move from Paris Saint-Germain to Borussia Dortmund, with form and fitness issues preventing him from making the desired impact in Germany. The Belgian right-back was free to leave BVB in the summer, but a serious muscle injury during pre-season prevented that from happening.

Meunier is now finally closing in on his return to full fitness, and was included in the Borussia Dortmund matchday squad for the first time this season on Sunday (against Eintracht Frankfurt). And Edin Terzic has now said that if the 32 year old keeps training like he has done in recent weeks, he will not have to wait long to get his opportunity in the first-team.

“Thomas Meunier has been back in team training with us for a few weeks now,” Terzic said during his press conference on Tuesday. “He had a very long downtime and wasn’t able to train with us for two months. But he was able to complete all of his training sessions during the last international break.” “We know all about the qualities Thomas Meunier possesses – especially in the physical department. He is on the right track, and like every other player who is under contract at Borussia Dortmund, we are planning with him. And if he continues to train like this, he will not have to wait much longer for his chance.”

There are less than 12 months left on Meunier’s current contract with Borussia Dortmund. And it is widely expected that he will leave the club either in the January transfer window or next summer.

But the lack of depth in the two full-back positions at Borussia Dortmund could present Thomas Meunier with a route back into the team, at least temporarily. </textarea>
