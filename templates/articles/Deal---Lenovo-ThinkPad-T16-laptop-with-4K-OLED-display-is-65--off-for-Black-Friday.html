The relatively new 16-inch version in Lenovo's successful T-series might not be as popular as the iconic T14, but notebook users who don't have to carry around their laptop on a daily basis might still want to take a closer look at an ongoing Black Friday sale of the ThinkPad T16 Gen 2, and more specifically the Intel configuration with the stunning 4K OLED screen.

This mentionable offer is available at Lenovo's official online store, which is where laptop buyers can now order the aforementioned ThinkPad T16 for US$1,149 including free shipping. This Black Friday price applies to the model with an Intel Core i7-1365U, 16GB of partly soldered DDR5-5200 RAM and a 512GB SSD. Furthermore, this SKU of the Lenovo ThinkPad T16 Gen 2 is equipped with a beautiful 4K OLED panel with full DCI-P3 coverage and up to 400 nits of brightness. In order to take advantage of this deal, please apply the coupon code "THINKDOORBUSTER11" during checkout.

Even though we tested a quite different configuration of the Lenovo ThinkPad T16 Gen 2, bargain hunters might want to check out our in-depth written review for further impressions of the robust magnesium chassis and some other features of this business laptop. For example, we liked the user-replaceable and comfortable keyboard, the quiet cooling system as well as the available RAM slot. On a more critical note, this machine does not sport an SD card reader and only has a single M.2 SSD slot. Overall, this Black Friday deal is a very interesting choice for shoppers who are looking for a sturdy 16-inch notebook with a high-resolution 4K OLED display.

Get the ThinkPad T16 Gen 2 (i7-1365U, 16/512GB) on sale for US$1,149 at Lenovo by applying "THINKDOORBUSTER11" in the shopping cart </textarea>
