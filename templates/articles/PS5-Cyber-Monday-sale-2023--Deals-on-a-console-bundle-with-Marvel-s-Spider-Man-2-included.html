The PlayStation 5 has been around for three years, if you can believe that. If you don't already have Sony's current console, there are some solid deals that might tempt you to take the plunge. The system is $50 off at GameStop with some caveats, but if you're planning to play Marvel's Spider-Man 2 or Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, there are bundles at Amazon that might make more sense for you. You can buy the new, slimmer PS5 model and either game for $499. In other words, you'll be getting a $70 game you might have already been planning to check out for free.

While many folks found it difficult to get their hands on the PS5 during the console's first couple of years, Sony has smoothed out the supply issues. Both the standard and all-digital versions of the console are readily available. Sony released updated models that are slimmer and lighter earlier this month.

The PS5 is a great console and an excellent entry point for those looking to get into modern gaming. It's certainly a worthwhile upgrade from the PlayStation 4 at this point. While we've seen many major games hit both PS4 and PS5 over the last few years, publishers and developers are making more titles exclusive to the current generation of consoles.

Sony's current system has a fantastic controller in the DualSense. When a game embraces the feature fully, the vibrations of the haptic feedback add an extra level of immersion. A high-end version of the controller is available for serious competitive players, while the highly customizable, accessibility minded Access controller will be available in December.

The PS5 is capable of delivering impressive visuals at framerates of up to 120 fps. While the library of games perhaps wasn't the most enticing at the outset, there's now a ton of great titles available for the console (nearly every PS4 game is playable on PS5 too).

On that note, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is an excellent followup to the previous games in the series, Spider-Man and Spider-Man: Miles Morales. You'll switch between Peter Parker and Miles Morales as the two superheroes attempt to (what else?) stop bad guys with nefarious plans. Hot tip: don't skip the side missions. These include some truly lovely stories and they offer a nice break from the main missions.

As for Modern Warfare 3, the campaign is underbaked, but let's face it: you're probably more likely to be interested in the multiplayer and/or zombies modes. Multiplayer has a major nostalgia factor as it includes all of the launch maps from 2009's original Modern Warfare 2. In addition, for the first time in the Call of Duty series, almost all of your gear will carry over from last year's game, the rebooted Modern Warfare 2.

Meanwhile, if you'd prefer just to have a discount on the standard PS5 model, you can snap one up from GameStop for $450, or $50 off. There are a few things to keep in mind here. The discount is for the original, beefier model and it only applies if you opt for same-day delivery ($13) or in-store pick up (in which case GameStop will give you another $5 off). As such, you'll need to be close enough to a GameStop to be eligible.
