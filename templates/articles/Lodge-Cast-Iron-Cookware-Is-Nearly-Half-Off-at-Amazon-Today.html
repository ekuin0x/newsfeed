6-Quart Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven

You can’t really can’t go wrong with this Dutch oven, especially at this time of year. It's the perfect piece of cookware to cook soups and stews since the material keeps an even, controlled temperature throughout. This one has a 6-quart capacity with two helper handles, plus a tight fitting lid to keep moisture locked in. With the enameled interior, you’ll also get a slick coating to keep bits from sticking around at the bottom. Score it on sale now for cozy winter recipes ahead.

10.25-Inch Cast Iron Skillet with Hot Handle Holder

Amazon

This is our favorite cast iron skillet without question. We gave it perfect scores across the board, praising its design, its ease of use, its performance, and how easy it was to clean. It provided the most even browning out of all of the skillets we tried, and nothing stuck in the pan during our tests, whether it was cornbread or pork. We like that it comes preseasoned, and this particular option comes with a handle holder to protect your hand from accidental burns, too.

3.6-Quart Enameled Cast Iron Oval Casserole

Amazon

This casserole pan acts similarly to a Dutch oven, just with a more unique shape. It’s best for casseroles of course, but also works well for braises, skillet dinners, and a wide variety of stove-top dishes. The shallow wide shape gives you extra surface area to nestle in chicken, salmon, and vegetables without having to worry about overcrowding the pan. It holds up to 3.5-quarts, and comes with helper handlers to transfer it from stovetop to oven and back with ease.

12-Inch Cast Iron Pan

Amazon

This 12-inch cast iron pan is a great option if you want something a little more compact but with a bigger surface area. It has two helper handles as opposed to a long handle, so it might be a little easier to maneuver if you plan to use it in the oven or even the grill. It's made with the brand's classic preseasoned cast iron so you can use it straight away for anything from braised chicken thighs to cornbread. Save big while it's 43% off.

10.5-Inch Cast Iron Square Grill Pan

Amazon

It’s cold out (and probably about to snow if it hasn’t already), which means the grill has likely become a less than ideal option for cooking. But, the cravings for seared salmon, charred vegetables, and juicy steaks don’t have to go away. With this grill pan, you can achieve those cross hatch marks without needing to step outside. This pan has ribbed edges like a grill, with a 10.5-inch diameter for the right amount of surface area on your stove. The ribs give you those grill marks you’ve been craving, and right now you can score it at a discounted price.

9-Inch Cast Iron Skillet

Amazon

This 9-inch skillet is a great buy if you’re looking for a middle-of the road sized skillet under $20. It’s on sale for just $18 right now, and has a 9-inch diameter that’ll work for anything from skillet dinners to desserts with ease. It has two pour spouts for easy draining, which is key if you plan to use it for frying. You’ll find yourself reaching for it everytime you cook a recipe.

13.25-Inch Cast Iron Skillet

Amazon

This big cast iron skillet is the one to grab if you plan on feeding a crowd. The 13.5-inch size gives you plenty of wiggle room for extra pieces of protein, larger casseroles, or big batches of vegetable sides. It’s good to have on hand especially for hosting season, since more folks will be dining with you. It has all the classic perks of the brand's skillets, just with an added helper handle so you can maneuver it more easily.

5-Quart Cast Iron Double Dutch Oven

Amazon

After testing two dozen Dutch ovens, this nifty Lodge model ranked as our absolute favorite cast iron option. It's a reliable choice for folks that want to cook with the classic, enamel-free surface, since it has all the qualities we love about the brand's cast iron. It heats well, doesn’t latch onto food bits, and has the perfect amount of surface area. Not only that, but, the lid doubles as a whole separate skillet, which means it can pull double-duty in your kitchen.

16.75-Inch Cast Iron Rectangular Reversible Grill and Griddle

Amazon

A griddle is an amazing piece of cookware to have in your kitchen. It can handle weekend brunches, weeknight dinners, and everything in between. This griddle is large and rectangular, with two sides that work for a multitude of projects. Use the flat side for pancakes, eggs, flatbreads, sandwiches, and more. Use the grill side to fire up burgers, vegetables, skewers, or even get a char on seasonal fruits — the options are endless. It’s 41% off right now, so pick it up while you can.

3-Quart Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven

Amazon

This smaller Dutch oven is a good buy for folks that live alone, or only cook for one to two people. It’s not too big at 3-quarts, making it ideal for smaller servings. It’s also a less expensive option at $66 compared to other brands, so it's a great piece for beginner cooks as well.

3-Quart Cast Iron Covered Deep Skillet

Amazon

This cookware piece is a cross between a pot and a skillet. It has a deep base that can hold 3-quarts, with a 10.25-inch diameter and 3-inch walls. It's great for frying, since you have extra depth, but you can use it for other dishes that need some extra space like casseroles or soups. It has a long handle, a helper handle, and a tight fitting lid for a complete ready-to-use set.

10.25-Inch Cast Iron Dual Handle Grill Pan

Amazon

This grill pan is similar to the other options the brand offers, just with a rounded shape and tighter handles. It’ll fit well on stovetops but is also great for more compact spaces like grills, campfires, and ovens. There’s 10.25-inches of surface area, so it has plenty of space for a few pieces of protein or sides. It also comes with pour spouts to safely remove any grease or residual liquid left over after cooking. At less than $30, it’s a year-round staple.
