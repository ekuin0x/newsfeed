                <textarea id="text" readonly> A groom killed four people at a wedding including his own bride Saturday.

29-year-old Chaturong Suksuk killed his bride, 44-year-old Kanchana Pachutehuek, after they were married in Thailand. Per the network, Chaturong abruptly left the wedding party, returned with a gun and shot his wife, her 62-year-old mother and 38-year-old sister.

Per the BBC, two other guests were struck by stray bullets, and one of those individuals later died.

the groom took his own life soon after opening fire.

Police speaking with the BBC said Chaturong, a Paralympic athlete and former soldier, "was quite intoxicated at the time," although they noted that his exact motive remains unknown. Per the BBC, media in Thailand cited guests, who claimed the couple had an argument during the party, and alleged that Chaturong felt insecure about the age gap between himself and his bride.

Authorities added that the claims were purely speculation and said that more evidence needed to be collected, although they expected to close the case soon, according to the BBC.

Per the BBC, Chaturong was a silver medalist in the Asean Para Games in Indonesia in 2022. Chaturong lost his right leg while serving with the paramilitary light infantry force, which is responsible for patrolling Thailand's borders, according to the network. </textarea>
