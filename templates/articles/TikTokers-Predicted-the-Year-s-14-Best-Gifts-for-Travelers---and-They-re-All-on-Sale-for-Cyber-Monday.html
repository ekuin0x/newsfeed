                <textarea id="text" readonly> As a social media-savvy Generation Z-er, when it comes to sourcing the best gifts for everyone on your list, TikTok is the destination. With millions of gift guide content, gifting inspiration, and more, the platform has slowly become the oracle for predicting the hottest presents of the season. And, luckily for you, most of these viral gifts are ready to shop for Cyber Monday.

With so many deals happening right now and with trends moving so quickly, it can be hard knowing where to even start and how to decipher between what’s in and what’s not. Fortunately, I've combed through TikTok and scoured the Internet to curate a list of this year's hottest gifts that are sure to delight everyone that you're shopping for, all while hunting for the best savings. From the Béis Weekender Bag to the Ugg Classic Short Boots, keep scrolling to officially become the best gift giver your friends and family know.

Hoka Clifton 8 Sneakers

Zappos

When it comes to reliable and comfortable sneakers, few shoes stand up to the wearing power of a pair of Hokas. And whether you’re looking for the perfect gift for the globetrotter in your life or that special someone who’s on their feet all day, you can’t go wrong with a pair of Hokas. These highly coveted sneakers have become a TikTok-favorite pair, and once you see how much your giftee loves this pair, you’ll be running to purchase a pair for yourself. And if they're out of stock, check out the Hoka Carbon X3 Sneakers that are also on sale.

Béis Weekender Bag

Beis

Between weekend trips, commutes, the gym, and looking to avoid checked bag fees, everyone needs a great duffel bag in their travel gear repertoire. And while there are plenty of options out there to choose from, few have received such rave reviews like the Béis Weekender Bag. In fact, in addition to being a Tik Tok-loved bag, it’s also an editor-loved weekender bag for its thoughtfully functional design and sleek look.

Apple AirPods Max Wireless On-Ear Headphones

Amazon

Fabulous quality aside, these Apple AirPod Max Headphones also happen to have an aesthetically pleasing flair that anyone on your list would absolutely gush over. And in addition to earning praise from TikTok creators, Amazon shoppers also have dubbed this stunning set as the “best over-ear headphones [they've] ever tried.” As an added bonus, they’re almost $1,000 off.

Sol De Janeiro Bum Bum Summer Jet Set

Sephora

Sol de Janeiro is an internet-obsessed brand loved for its delicious scented lotions, sprays, and washes. Currently, countless TikTokers are adding this jet-set collection to their holiday wish lists, and it's a recommendation that you should consider. This curated set comprises a travel-friendly trio of lotion, body spray, and shower gel that is also thoughtfully sized to fit seamlessly into stockings, too.

Ugg Classic Short Boots

Walmart

According to TikTok, if you really want to win the unofficial (but sorta official) title of the best gift giver, you need to snag a pair of these Ugg Classic Short Boots. But you’ll have to act fast, because if we learned anything from last year, it's that the hottest items (like these cozy boots) are also the ones that sell out first. And if they do, no sweat, because the Koolaburra Ugg Mini Boots are on sale for $60.

Clinique Cult Classics On the Go Set

Nordstrom

I'm a former beauty retail employee, and it’s been nearly impossible to find Clinique's Almost Lipstick in black honey in stock over the past few years. However, right now, it’s not only in stock, but it’s also in a value set with the brand’s top-rated (and my mom’s personal favorite) mascara. I’ve seen countless TikTok videos of creators raving about this lipstick and looking to find similar lipstick to match this popular product, but why not get the real thing if you can? It also happens to be the perfect stocking stuffer size, too.

Abercrombie Women’s Menswear Mini Skort

Abercrombie & Fitch

Ever since Abercrombie’s rebrand into elevated, comfortable staple pieces, the brand has been releasing pieces that get better with each season. And right now, the Internet (myself included) cannot stop gushing about this adorable, best-selling mini skort that looks great as is, or worn with a pair of tights. In addition to hardly ever being in stock, it's also hardly ever on sale so if I were you, I’d be adding this one to my cart ASAP.

Abercrombie Women’s Curve Love Sloane Tailored Pants

Abercrombie & Fitch

Speaking of Abercrombie, these tailored pants are the comfortable-yet-elevated travel staple that’ll take you from the office to the airport with ease — all while looking and feeling your best. They’re, and well any item from Abercrombie, is a frequent must on many TikTok holiday shopping guides, and I’m considering gifting a pair for myself, especially while they’re on sale.

Dior Lip Glow Oil

Nordstrom

There are few items that have sustained such consistent buzz like the Dior Lip Glow Oil. And as a fan of the effortlessly fabulous gloss myself, I completely understand the hype. Aside from the slight plumping effect it gives, the gloss also comes with a slight hue that keeps me looking put together on even the most hectic travel days. In fact, there’s so much love behind this gloss that it’s hard to scroll more than a few Tik Toks without seeing a creator gushing over these lip oils. They’re not cheap, but absolutely worth it and makes for a jaw-dropping gift for anyone on your list with an affinity for beauty.

Gucci Flora Gorgeous Travel Spray Perfume Trio Set

Sephora

It’s no surprise that Gucci perfume has earned a spot on countless TikTok wish lists — I mean, it’s Gucci. Absolutely anyone in your life would be thrilled to be gifted this fragrance set that includes three of the brand's most popular scents (friends, if you’re reading this, please gift me this set) in a conveniently travel-friendly size. And better yet, it’s in a value set for $99.

Béis The Cosmetic Case

Beis

This Cosmetic Case went viral for it's amazing stain-proof lining, and has continued to be a best seller ever since. It's Travel + Leisure's favorite cosmetic case and a must-have for any traveler who values a skincare routine. At 9.5 x 7 inches, it's the perfect size to fit everything you need on-the-go, yet durable enough you may just use it for daily storage. Plus, it comes in ten different colors from classic black to eye-catching citron, so you can grab one for you and one for your traveling bestie during this special sale.

Girlfriend Collective Ballerina Cropped Recycled Puffer

Girlfriend Collective

TikTokers believe that any fan of the cozy-cute aesthetic would appreciate opening a present with a cropped puffer inside. It's made from recycled water bottles and is incredibly durable, boasting a wind and water-resistant design that makes it ideal for any cold-weather trip. Plus, it’s fleece-lined for an extra touch of warmth. And the cherry on top? It’s 35 percent off during the Girlfriend Collective's sitewide sale.

Athleta Elation Leggings

Athleta

Athleisure pieces are always easy (yet fabulous) gifts to give — I mean who doesn’t love a cozy pair of leggings? And leggings from all brands are on practically every list this season but my personal favorite is this particular pair from Athleta. They’re extremely comfortable with its buttery soft material, but it also gives the holiday razzle dazzle vibes with its special-edition metallic print. Some colorways are now as low as $99, so you won't want to pass up this deal. And while you’re at it, make sure to add the matching sports bra to your cart for a complete set.

NuFace Mini+ Facial Toning Microcurrent Kit

Ulta

I’ve been using the NuFace facial toning device for the past few years, especially when I travel, to keep my skin looking fresh and plump. The microcurrents have drastically improved my skin texture and look over time, and it's become my secret weapon to bright, awake-looking skin no matter what. So when I saw it made the list on a few TikTok gift guides, I was completely unsurprsied. However, the 30 percent discount did make my jaw drop.
