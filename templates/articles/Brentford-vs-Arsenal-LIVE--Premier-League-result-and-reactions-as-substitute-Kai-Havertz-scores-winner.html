Arsenal went top of the Premier League as Kai Havertz headed home a late winner against Brentford.

After the draw between Manchester City and Liverpool had opened the door for Arsenal to take top spot, it looked for so long like it would be a night to forget for Mikel Arteta’s side as they struggled to breakdown aresolute home defence.

But a piece of Bukayo Saka brilliance put a goal on a plate for Havertz, and the German sharply directed a downward header past Mark Flekken to snatch a 1-0 victory.

The visitors had barely got out of first gear on a chilly London evening and failed to create many clear chances, while Aaron Ramsdale - standing in for the ineligible David Raya in goal - endured a couple of nervy moments at the other end.

Declan Rice spared his goalkeeper’s blushes with a last-ditch first half clearance, while Oleksandr Zinchenko also produced a timely clearance off the line to ensure Ramsdale’s goal was not breached.

And that alllowed Saka and Havertz to combine to secure three points that take Arteta’s men above both the defending champions and Liverpool to head the Premier League pack after 13 matches.
