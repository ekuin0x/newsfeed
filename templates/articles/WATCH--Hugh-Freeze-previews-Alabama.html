addressed the loss to New Mexico State to begin his weekly press conference Monday. He took ownership for it. But he also knows his Auburn team has to throw that game in the trash and move on with the Iron Bowl coming this weekend."We quickly have to turn the page and put that behind us," Freeze said. "We all know what the Iron Bowl means to so many, and you can fix your feelings a whole heck of a lot with a good performance in that game."We have to have a balancing act today when we get with the team on owning mine and everyone who had a responsibility in the way that we played Saturday. We have to own that, but we have to move forward pretty quickly to get ready for what I think is the best team I've seen on film at the point at which we're playing them. They're playing at an extremely high level, and what a rivalry to be a part of. We're going to try to educate our young men as best we can with the use of former players and the history of this great game. Hopefully, they have a clear understanding of what this means to so many people."The Iron Bowl is a game where you can throw the records out. The last three times Alabama has played in Jordan-Hare Stadium, the Crimson Tide were ranked No. 5 or higher. Auburn won two of the three, and the other one (2021) went to four overtimes before Alabama ultimately prevailed."I think it speaks to the history and the people that have gone before us â€“ fans and coaches and players who understood what this rivalry meant to so many and they were willing to lay it on the line," Freeze said. "Particularly doing it here in Jordan-Hare where our fans have been incredible, and I think they'll even be at another level come Saturday. It just speaks to the love and passion that our people have for our program, particularly when you're playing in this game."Watch the full press conference above as Freeze previews this year's Iron Bowl. </textarea>
