                <textarea id="text" readonly> Microsoft Office isn't the cheap, with monthly payments that quickly add up over the years. But that's not the case during Cyber Monday, as right now you can pick up Microsoft Office for less than $30. Typically offered for $229, now's a great time to finally upgrade to the iconic (and powerful) software. You'll need to hurry, however, as the deal expires today at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET.

Microsoft Office 2019 $30 (was $229) There are a few caveats to these two incredible deals. The first is that they're for Microsoft Office 2019--which is obviously a few years. The second is that this can only be installed on one PC. But considering the software is discounted by nearly $200, those should be fairly easy to overlook. PC Mac

If you're buying for Windows, you'll get Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2019. For Mac, you're getting Microsoft Office Home and Business 2019.

Regardless of platform, here's a look at the software featured in the above bundles:

Word 2019

Excel 2019

PowerPoint 2019

Outlook 2019

OneNote 2019

Windows users will also get access to Publisher 2019 and Access 2019, while Mac users will get Teams Classic 2019.

If you're not sold on this deal, you can check out another that offers Microsoft Office 2021 for $60 on PC and $50 on Mac. And if you still haven't upgraded your PC to Windows 11 Pro , you'll find it listed for $23 (down from $199) for Cyber Monday.
