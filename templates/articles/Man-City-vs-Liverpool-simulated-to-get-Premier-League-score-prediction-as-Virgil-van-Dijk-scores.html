Liverpool will be looking to end an eight-year wait for victory at the Etihad in the Premier League when the Reds face Manchester City on Saturday afternoon. Its last win was the 4-1 in 2015, just weeks into Jürgen Klopp's tenure.

After a two-week international break, Liverpool returns to action in yet another early kick-off, taking on title rivals Manchester City in the Premier League. Victory for Liverpool would see Klopp's side overtake City into first place, but defeat could see the Reds drop as low as fourth.

Liverpool's last outing before the international break saw Mohamed Salah score twice in a 3-0 win over Brentford, and Klopp will be hoping his side can carry that momentum into Saturday's clash. The last meeting between Liverpool and City ended in a 4-1 defeat for the Reds, with Liverpool hoping to end the host's 23-game winning streak on home turf in all competitions.

So can Liverpool pick up a big three points on Sunday? Let's take a look. To complete this simulation, we used EA FC 24 and updated the squads with the latest injuries and suspensions.

We predict that City could set up in a 4-3-3 formation, with their line-up as follows: Ederson; Walker, Dias, Stones, Gvardiol; Rodri, Bernardo, Alvarez; Foden, Haaland, Doku.

We predict that Liverpool could line up in a 4-3-3 formation, with their starting XI as follows: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Konaté, Van Dijk, Tsimikas; Mac Allister, Szoboszlai, Gravenberch; Salah, Núñez, Jota.

It was a lightning start from Liverpool at the Etihad, with the Reds coming close to taking the lead when Mohamed Salah's cross to the back post was headed against the crossbar by Luis Díaz. But despite the majority of early chances falling to the Reds, it was City who went ahead.

After winning possession back on the edge of their own box, City hit the Reds on the counter-attack, outnumbering Klopp's men as the hosts surged forward. Phil Foden threaded a pass through to Jeremy Doku who got the better of Trent Alexander-Arnold, and his fizzed cross into the box was tapped home by Erling Haaland.

After going behind, Liverpool weren't hit for confidence, with the Reds instantly hitting back with some more big chances of their own. Darwin Núñez should've scored when he sent his effort wide after going through one-on-one, but just before the break, the Reds found the equalizer.

A long-range strike from Alexis Mac Allister caught out Ederson in goal, and the Brazilian tipped what should've been a simple save over the bar to avoid any embarrassment. Dominik Szoboszlai sent the resulting corner into the box, and after peeling away from his marker, Virgil van Dijk met the cross at the near post and sent a powerful header into the far corner of the net.

In the second half, City were the better side, with Bernardo Silva causing all sorts of problems for the Liverpool midfield. But, Van Dijk was on top form, with the defender keeping Haaland and the rest of the City attack quiet for the remainder of the game and picking up player of the match as his side earned a point.
