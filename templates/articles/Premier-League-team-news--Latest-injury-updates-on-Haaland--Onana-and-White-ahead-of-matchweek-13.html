                <textarea id="text" readonly> The final international break of 2023 is over and that means almost non-stop Premier League action for the next four months.

But with injuries before and during the domestic break, numerous clubs are likely anxious about the fitness of crucial players leading up to the 13th matchweek of the 2023-24 season.

The weekend’s action begins with a mouthwatering clash at the Etihad Stadium, as Manchester City face Liverpool in Saturday’s early kick-off. Elsewhere, Arsenal travel to Brentford and Newcastle United host Chelsea, while Manchester United’s trip to Everton — deducted 10 points last week — is the pick of Sunday’s games.

The Athletic runs you through the latest injury news and key information for all the fixtures.

Saturday, November 25 (12.30pm GMT)

Manchester City team news: Erling Haaland trained on Thursday and Pep Guardiola said he will “hopefully play a part” on Saturday after withdrawing from the Norway squad. Nathan Ake, Matheus Nunes, and Ederson also withdrew from their respective national team squads with injuries and Guardiola said a number of players will be assessed after training on Friday. Sergio Gomez is also a doubt. John Stones is likely ruled out. Kevin De Bruyne remains a long-term absentee. Mateo Kovacic is expected to miss a few weeks with a quad issue.

Liverpool team news: Thiago, Andy Robertson and Stefan Bajcetic are ruled out. Jurgen Klopp confirmed that Ryan Gravenberch, Curtis Jones, Joe Gomez and Ibrahima Konate are available for selection after recent injury issues. Conor Bradley is set to make his comeback for the under-21s after recovering from a stress fracture in his back, while fellow youngster Kaide Gordon has also trained with the senior squad this week as he looks to put his injury problems behind him.

Referee: Chris Kavanagh (VAR: Stuart Attwell)

Opta omen: City have won their last 23 home games in all competitions – victory here would equal the record for an English top-flight club, currently held by Sunderland between December 1890 and April 1892.

Saturday, November 25 (3pm GMT)

Burnley team news: Lyle Foster is away from the Burnley squad due to mental health reasons. Arijanet Muric and Jack Cork remain unavailable, while Hjalmar Ekdal and Manuel Benson are in contention to return.

West Ham team news: Michail Antonio faces two to three weeks out after sustaining an injury while with Jamaica. Jarrod Bowen withdrew prematurely from the England squad and David Moyes said he “hoped” the forward would be available but would wait until Saturday to make a decision. Mohammed Kudus appeared to recover from a minor problem, having featured as a substitute in Ghana’s 1-0 loss against Comoros earlier this week.

Opta omen: West Ham have lost seven of their last 10 Premier League away games (W2 D1), conceding at least twice in each defeat.

Saturday, November 25 (3pm GMT)

Luton team news: Albert Sambi Lokonga, Mads Andersen, Reece Burke and Dan Potts remain out. Issa Kabore is also sidelined after suffering a concussion and Chiedozie Ogbene will “hopefully” be available after missing the Republic of Ireland’s Euro 2024 qualifiers with an ankle injury.

Crystal Palace team news: Dean Henderson, James Tomkins and Jesurun Rak-Sakyi are Roy Hodgson’s injury concerns ahead of this game. Palace otherwise have no new injury worries, although Jordan Ayew and Jefferson Lerma did not return from international duty until Friday so will be assessed ahead of Saturday.

Referee: Jarred Gillett (VAR: Rob Jones)

Opta omen: Only Mohamed Salah to Darwin Nunez (13) and Moussa Diaby to Ollie Watkins (11) have created more chances for another teammate than Luton’s Alfie Doughty has for Carlton Morris (eight) in the Premier League this season.

Saturday, November 25 (3pm GMT)

Newcastle team news: Fabian Schar and Miguel Almiron are fit but Eddie Howe would not be drawn on whether Alexander Isak will return. Howe said the club were also “checking” on Sean Longstaff and admitted he was “slightly unclear” on a timeframe for Callum Wilson’s recovery from a hamstring issue. Sven Botman remains sidelined and while Howe said he hoped the defender would be back quickly with the group, he admitted: “There’s a chance that won’t happen”. Lewis Hall cannot play against his parent club and Sandro Tonali is serving a 10-month suspension. Bruno Guimaraes, however, can return after serving his suspension before the international break.

Chelsea team news: Wesley Fofana, Carney Chukwuemeka, Trevoh Chalobah and Ben Chilwell remain out with long-term problems. Levi Colwill will make the squad after withdrawing from England duty through injury. Romeo Lavia and Christopher Nkunku are nearing returns as they continue their rehabilitation. Mauricio Pochettino said: “Nkunku is a little ahead of Lavia, he was doing things with the group last week, but he has still not recovered enough to be part of the squad.”

Referee: Simon Hooper (VAR: John Brooks)

Opta omen: Newcastle are yet to lose a Saturday 3pm Premier League kick-off under Eddie Howe (W12 D6). However, the last side to beat them in this slot were Chelsea at St James’ Park back in October 2021.

Saturday, November 25 (3pm GMT)

Saturday, November 25 (3pm GMT)

Sheffield United team news: Chris Basham, Rhys Norrington-Davies, John Egan, Tom Davies, Daniel Jebbison and Rhian Brewster are sidelined. Jayden Bogle is still carrying a “minor” knock, and Paul Heckingbottom confirmed Anel Ahmedhodzic and Oli McBurnie are available once more. Heckingbottom said: “With them back, and a hopefully a couple more, our bench is really competitive and when we’re making substitutions we’re having a bigger impact on the game.”

Bournemouth team news: Max Aarons is out for “some time” with a hamstring injury. Tyler Adams, Ryan Fredericks, Alex Scott and Emiliano Marcondes are all unavailable.

Referee: Andy Madley (VAR: Peter Bankes)

Opta omen: Bournemouth are without a win in an away Premier League game this season (D1 L4) and have shipped 17 goals, the most of any side on the road.

Saturday, November 25 (5.30pm GMT)

Brentford team news: Nathan Collins misses out with an ankle injury sustained on international duty. Aaron Hickey, Rico Henry and Kevin Schade are out for the long-term. Ivan Toney is suspended until January due to betting violations. Keane Lewis-Potter and Shandon Baptiste are available once more. Mikkel Damsgaard and Josh Dasilva are scheduled to play in a behind-closed-doors friendly on Tuesday.

Arsenal team news: David Raya is ineligible to play against his parent club, while Thomas Partey, Emile Smith Rowe and Jurrien Timber are long-term absentees. Fabio Vieira is suspended, with Cedric Soares an injury doubt. Gabriel Jesus returned to action with Brazil during the international break. Mikel Arteta said Ben White and Martin Odegaard would both “hopefully” be able to play following injury layoffs, with White’s availability hinging on whether he trains on Friday.

Referee: Tim Robinson (VAR: Michael Salisbury)

Opta omen: This will be Mikel Arteta’s 200th match in charge of Arsenal in all competitions (W115 D34 L50). Whatever the result, he’s won more games in his first 200 in charge of the Gunners than any of the other nine managers to reach the milestone with the club.

Aston Villa team news: Tyrone Mings and Emi Buendia are out with anterior cruciate ligament injuries. John McGinn will “hopefully” be available, and Emi Martinez is expected to play after returning from international duty with “a little bit of pain”. Leon Bailey and Nicolo Zaniolo also returned from international duty not 100 per cent fit, but Unai Emery said he was hopeful they could be involved. Bertrand Traore is a doubt after returning from international duty with an injury. Jacob Ramsey is progressing in his recovery.

Referee: Rob Jones (VAR: Jarred Gillett)

Opta omen: Tottenham have conceded six goals in second-half stoppage time in the Premier League this season, more than any other side. Each of their last four goals conceded have come in added time at the end of the match (2 vs Chelsea, 2 vs Wolves).

Sunday, November 26 (4.30pm GMT)

Everton team news: Amadou Onana will miss out on Sunday due to a calf injury. Dele Alli and Andre Gomes are both back on the grass, while Seamus Coleman continues his recovery from a long-term knee injury.

Manchester United team news: Luke Shaw returned to training this week and will be in the squad but Casemiro, Lisandro Martinez, Tyrell Malacia and Amad Diallo remain long-term absentees. Christian Eriksen is also out, while Jadon Sancho has not featured since a falling out with manager Erik ten Hag in September. A decision will be made on Rasmus Hojlund on Saturday, but he has trained and is “making very good steps” following a hamstring injury. Andre Onana is “OK” after appearing to sustain an injury while on Cameroon duty and missing their World Cup qualifier against Libya on Tuesday.

Referee: John Brooks (VAR: Chris Kavanagh)

Opta omen: Everton have won just one of their last eight Premier League meetings with Man Utd (D4 L3), a 1-0 home win in April 2022.

Monday, November 27 (8pm GMT)

Fulham team news: Adama Traore has had a set back following his hamstring injury. He joins Tyrese Francois, Rodrigo Muniz and Issa Diop on the sidelines for Monday’s game.

Pedro Neto is also unavailable due to a hamstring issue. “He’s got a little bit more work to do,” Gary O’Neil said of Neto. “Pedro will stay with the physios and fitness staff for a bit longer. There’s no exact time frame, but Monday he won’t be available. Hopefully it’s weeks.”

Referee: Michael Salisbury (VAR: Stuart Attwell)

Opta omen: Fulham have won just one of their last 14 league games against Wolves (D4 L9), a 2-0 home win in the Championship in February 2018.
