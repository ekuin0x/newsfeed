Dell monitors usually command a relatively high retail price tag, but aggressive discounts come by fairly often during Cyber Monday.

Dell Cyber Monday Electronics Deals

Why Pick a Dell or Alienware Gaming PC?

Not everyone is the DIY type, and building your own PC is definitely not for everyone. If you're in the market for a prebuilt gaming PC, Dell is one of best brands we'd recommend. The Alienware gaming desktops offer a staggering array of options, all built into a custom chassis that's both easy on the eyes and easy on the wallet. Alienware gaming laptops in recent years have been redesigned to be thinner and lighter while still offering the same immense power under the hood. Consistent build quality, available inventory, frequent sales, and solid customer service are the main reasons why Dell is at the top of our buying list. Below, you'll find some of the best deals available on PCs and laptops on Dell right now. </textarea>
