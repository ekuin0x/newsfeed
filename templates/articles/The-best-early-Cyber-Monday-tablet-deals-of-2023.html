                <textarea id="text" readonly> UPDATE: Nov. 25, 2023, 12:15 p.m. EST We've updated this story with current Cyber Weekend pricing/availability, a new "best splurge" top pick, and new deals on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+, Apple iPad mini, and 11-inch Apple iPad Pro.

Folks, it's Cyber Weekend. You already know the deal. A bunch of great products are about to be super cheap for a limited time and you need to figure out what's best for you before pulling the trigger.

It's no secret that Apple's iPad is the most prestigious name in the tablet world, and you can score one of the latest models for less than $500. But that's not all — Google's excellent Pixel Tablet has also gotten a good chunk of change chopped off its asking price, while Amazon continues to offer its basic Fire tablets for a lot less than everyone else's tablets. We even found a budget tablet deal for — ahem — less than $30. It certainly won't be around long, so grab it if you're in the market for an affordable, basic tablet.

Here are some of the best tablet offers right now from top brands like Apple, Amazon, Samsung, Lenovo, and more. We'll be updating this list as often as we can to stay up to date on the best deals available — check back if you don't see what you're looking for.

Note: All newly added deals are marked with a ✨. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.

Best tablet deal under $500

Why we like it

Released earlier this year, Google's Pixel Tablet is the real deal. Its 11-inch display is more than capable as a vehicle for streaming, and its no-frills Android OS makes it compatible with just about any app you could ask for. But what really sets Google's debut tablet apart is the included charging dock, which attaches to the tablet magnetically to keep the device upright. Not only does it power the tablet, but the dock has speakers built in, turning the Pixel Tablet into a little desktop TV that can keep you entertained (or distracted) while you get some work done.

Best iPad deal under $500

Why we like it

The entry-level iPad isn't the most glamorous or powerful in Apple's tablet lineup, but an iPad is still an iPad. With the 2022 base model, you get Apple's in-house A14 Bionic chip to power the device, all the bells and whistles of iPadOS, and support for the Magic Keyboard accessory. Oh, and the best part? There's a pink model available. You really can't lose here, folks.

Best tablet deal under $100

Why we like it

Maybe you don't want or need a prestige brand or a speaker dock with your tablet. Maybe all you care about is having a tablet that works and doesn't destroy your bank account. Thankfully, Amazon's latest Fire HD 10 tablet is both basically brand new and absurdly cheap during Black Friday. Launched in October with little fanfare, the new Fire HD 10 is supposed to be 25 percent faster than the previous model, lighter to hold, and longer-lasting on a full charge. It also has stylus support, if that's your thing.
