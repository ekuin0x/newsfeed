                <textarea id="text" readonly> With a good defense and solid weapons on offense, the struggles at quarterback are what ultimately sunk the Matt Rhule regime.

While Reich declined to state his preference for a veteran signal-caller versus a first-round rookie, the fact that Matt Corral and Jacob Eason are the only QBs currently under contract makes it a focal point this offseason for Fitterer and Reich. Might they chase the likes of a Derek Carr or Jimmy Garoppolo﻿? Is using the No. 9 overall pick on a QB the best bet for long-term success?

Later, Fitterer noted he hasn't started evaluating the quarterbacks but leans toward the draft option.

"I don't think you ever want to box yourself in and say we're going to strictly draft," the GM told reporters. "I've always kind of said that's the proper way to do it. To draft and develop from a cost-effective standpoint. But if we don't believe that guy is there this year -- and we haven't even started that process, our scouts have. We'll look at all options. But in an ideal world, we'd be draft and develop."

Reich acknowledged that every quarterback must, at some point, win from the pocket but sounded as if he'd like to run an offense that includes a dual-threat option.

"We all know the way the game's going, right?" he said. "We all know the game is going to a more movement-style quarterback. I embrace that. I love that. We worked with some in Philadelphia, worked with Carson Wentz﻿, and we did a lot of good things with movement, RPOs, play-action, all that stuff. Same thing in the years in Indy. We had some dropback, some movement guys. Ultimately, we can adapt to whatever, but where the game is going, most of the guys coming out in college have more movement, right? That has some advantages."

While the quarterback situation sorts itself out, Reich plans to build his offense from the ground up. </textarea>
