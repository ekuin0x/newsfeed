                <textarea id="text" readonly> A “cluster” of eye syphilis cases have been found in Michigan, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This week, the agency reported five cases of eye — or “ocular” — syphilis “in women with a common male sex partner” that occurred between March and July of 2022.

All of the women, aged 40 to 60 years and treated with penicillin, named the same partner when interviewed about their sexual history, including three who reported meeting the man online.

Symptoms exhibited among the patients included blurred or double vision, floaters, headache, sensitivity to light, skin rashes as well as genital sores.

Other symptoms can also include red eyes, eye pain or eye lesions, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Ocular syphilis is rare — only occurring in approximately 1% to 5% of people infected with neurosyphilis, a fatal complication of the bacteria that affects the brain and spinal cord — and could cause permanent damage, and even blindness.

The complications are typically a result of untreated syphilis, although ocular syphilis can occur at any stage of infection.

Upon investigation, the CDC found that the man with connections to all five women had been treated for a presumed herpes simplex virus infection but had not been tested for syphilis when he presented with lesions at a hospital.

After being contacted by health officials, the man, who no longer exhibited any symptoms, was diagnosed with early latent syphilis.

The agency believes an “unidentified” strain of the infection was “a risk factor for developing systemic manifestations of syphilis” in the Michigan women.

This year, reports of sexually transmitted infections — namely, syphilis — have soared.

In 2021, the CDC reported 176,713 cases of syphilis, equating to an uptick of 74% since 2017.

Just this month, the agency reported an alarming rise in newborn syphilis cases — 3,700 infants were born with the infection last year — an increase of more than tenfold over a decade. </textarea>
