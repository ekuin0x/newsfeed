                <textarea id="text" readonly> "Crowd chanting my name is something I will never take for granted. I dreamt of it as a child. Six to 12 months ago, I was not even in the frame but the stars have aligned,” Rachin Ravindra said after playing a match-winning knock against Sri Lanka in Bengaluru, where his grandparents continue to reside.

Where was Rachin Ravindra born

Rachin was born in Wellington on November 18, 1999. His father Ravi Krishnamurthy, born in Bengaluru, was a software architect who settled in New Zealand in 1997.

Cricket was always a part of Rachin Ravindra’s family. His father was a cricket enthusiast who continued playing at the club level even after shifting to New Zealand.

Rachin believed that he was named after his father’s favourite cricketers - Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid (“Ra” from Rahul and “chin” from Sachin). But the name was just a coincidence.

“When Rachin was born, my wife suggested the name, and we didn’t spend a lot of time discussing it,” Ravi Krishnamurthy told The Print. “The name sounded good, was easy to spell, and short, so we decided to go with it.

“It was only some years later that we realised the name was a mix of Rahul and Sachin’s names. He wasn’t named with the intention to make our child a cricketer or anything of the sort.”

Nevertheless, influenced by his father’s affection for the sport, Rachin Ravindra began playing cricket at the age of five and travelled to Bengaluru along with his father every year with the club team.

"I think I am lucky enough to have come here (India) often, especially during my teenage years. Almost like a club tour kind of thing, play games on these practice pitches, I think it has helped me a lot," Rachin said when asked about what helped him perform so well in Indian conditions during the World Cup.

Rachin Ravindra’s career

Rachin Ravindra was part of the New Zealand squad for the Under-19 Cricket World Cup in 2016. At just 16, he was the youngest player in the New Zealand squad.

He also played in the 2018 U19 World Cup and was named one of the rising stars of the tournament by the ICC. He made his List A debut for New Zealand A against Pakistan A in the same year.

Three years later, Rachin made his Test debut against India in Kanpur. Though he did not have the best of the series, his 91-ball 18 not out, at No. 8. saved the Test match for New Zealand late in December 2021.

He was also selected for the Bangladesh series in early January 2022 but failed to produce the goods.

Rachin Ravindra made his debut in T20 International cricket against Bangladesh in 2021.

In the early stages of his career, his statistics are quite modest but Rachin’s performance in the 2023 ODI World Cup establishes him as one of the all-format future stars for New Zealand. </textarea>
