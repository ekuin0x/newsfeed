                <textarea id="text" readonly> Stifel U.S. Freeski Team slopestyle team athletes Mac Forehand and Alex Hall podiumed in the first slopestyle World Cup of the season, taking home second and third respectively.

Due to tough weather conditions, qualifiers were rescheduled from Friday to Thursday with hope of finals on Friday. However, due to the forecast predicting extreme winds and heavy snowfall, the finals were ultimately canceled. Results were determined based on qualifications, making this the second freeski World Cup to do so this season, after last month's Big Air Chur event was cut short due to weather.

Taking advantage of the qualifiers and knowing cancelations were possible, Forehand and Hall executed unique, stylish and technically difficult jump runs. Forehand put down a switch left double 1620 lead stale grab to right double 900 lock with a mute grab. In Hall's creative third-place finish, he executed a right double 900 pretzel with a safety grab to switch left tail butter double 1260 mute grab, a run that would secure his 10th career World Cup podium.

Canada's Evan McEachran took home his first slopestyle World Cup win ever.

Stifel U.S. Freeski Team slope team athletes Cody LaPlante, Konnor Ralph and Troy Podmilksak also delivered excellent runs, earning scores that would have given them a chance to compete in finals. On the women's side, Rell Harwood secured a spot in the finals as well.

"Very proud of the whole team yesterday," said Stifel U.S. Freeski Team pro slope team head coach Dave Euler. "We've had lots of bad weather at recent training camps. It was amazing to have a perfect competition day, which allowed the athletes to showcase their incredible skills. Having Mac and Alex on the podium, along with six athletes making finals, makes it even better! Great kickoff to the slopestyle season, and I am excited to keep the momentum building into Beijing and Copper big airs."

Up next, the Stifel U.S. Freeski Team slope team travels to Beijing, China, the host of the 2022 Olympic Winter Games, for a big air World Cup event Dec. 1-2.
