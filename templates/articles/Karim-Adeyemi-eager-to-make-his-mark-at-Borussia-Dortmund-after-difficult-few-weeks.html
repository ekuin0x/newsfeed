Borussia Dortmund hopeful Gregor Kobel will not be out for too long due to facial injury by Tushar Bahl

Karim Adeyemi has admitted that the last few weeks have not been easy for him, but he is eager to help the team in any way he can.

It has been a difficult start to the season for Karim Adeyemi, who lost his place in the Borussia Dortmund starting XI due to underwhelming performances and has come under considerable criticism.

The 21 year old finally found some form against Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday as he came off the bench and set up the equalising goal for Julian Brandt late on.

The assist showed exactly what Adeyemi is capable of, as he breezed past an Eintracht Frankfurt defender with a stunning turn of pace before picking out Julian Brandt inside the box with a well placed low cross.

Adeyemi admitted after the game that things have not been easy for him in the last few weeks. And while the assist gave him confidence, he is far from satisfied.

“It always feels good for me when I play. It helps me build self-confidence. The last few weeks have not been easy for me, but things are going well for the team,” Adeyemi said. “I’ve been working hard and trying to gain confidence on the training pitch. I’d like to come back even stronger and help the team – it worked [against Eintracht Frankfurt] with an assist. I’m happy about that and it gives me confidence. But I’m still far from satisfied.”

The assist was Karim Adeyemi’s first goal involvement of the season so far, and he will now look to build on that in the coming weeks and force his way back into the Borussia Dortmund starting XI. The 21 year old certainly has the potential to be a game-changer for club and country on a consistent basis. And he will get his next opportunity to make an impact on Wednesday as BVB take on TSG Hoffenheim in the DFB-Pokal. </textarea>
