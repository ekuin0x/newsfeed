                <textarea id="text" readonly> Bayern Munich parted ways with two goalkeepers in the summer transfer window. Yann Sommer left the club permanently to join Inter Milan. The Swiss goalkeeper wanted to play regularly, which was not a guarantee at Bayern. Sommer had a transfer agreement with Bayern, which allowed Inter to sign him for a small fee.

Alexander Nubel was the other senior club to leave Bayern. The German goalkeeper was previously expected to leave permanently, but he sealed a loan move to VfB Stuttgart. Bayern are keeping a close eye on his progress at Stuttgart.

Nubel has enjoyed a very good start to the campaign with Stuttgart. The German goalkeeper has conceded only seven goals in five games. He also has three clean sheets in the Bundesliga, the most for a goalkeeper in the league this season. After a productive two-year loan spell at Monaco, Nubel has taken a step in the right direction to improve as a goalkeeper.

Stuttgart are enjoying a terrific start to the league campaign. They are currently second in the table. The club rates Nubel very highly and would like to keep him for several years. While talking to Sport1 (via Bulinews), Stuttgart’s sporting director, Fabian Wohlgemuth, revealed the club’s wish to make Nubel’s transfer permanent.

“We were very persistent, almost insistent. Our goalkeeper coach called him several times a day. We knew right away that he was a good fit for us. We really wanted to invest in the position. He gives the players in front of him a great deal of security. Whether he’ll be with us for the next six or seven years remains to be seen.”

Alexander Nubel doesn’t see a future at Bayern in the presence of Manuel Neuer. He might be open to joining Stuttgart permanently if there is no chance of becoming the number one at Bayern. The German goalkeeper will only consider staying at Bayern if he is given assurances over playing time.

Bayern will have to make a final decision on Nubel’s future next summer. He currently has a contract until 2025 with the Bavarian club. If Die Roten considers him a long-term successor to Neuer, they will have to extend his contract and give him opportunities to play regularly. If not, they will have to cash in.

For now, Nubel needs to make the most out of the loan spell. The better he performs, the better will be his chances to become Bayern’s number one. If Die Roten still doesn’t give him opportunities, other big clubs in Germany and Europe will come for him next summer. Nubel will also have the option to stay in Stuttgart if he is settled at the club.

Meanwhile, Rekordmeister are planning to open contract talks with Sven Ulreich and Manuel Neuer in the autumn. The two senior goalkeepers will be free agents next summer. Both of them want to stay in Munich, but Die Roten needs a long-term vision for the goalkeeping department sooner rather than later. </textarea>
