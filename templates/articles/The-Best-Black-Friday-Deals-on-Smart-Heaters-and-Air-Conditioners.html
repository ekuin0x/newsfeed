Home temperature control is one of the few home categories where smart technology can actually make a big, measurable difference. Once you set up thermostat automation in various zones of the home and put your air conditioning on a schedule so that the house is nice and cool when you get home from work, you won't be able to go back. Though there aren't many players in the smart heating and cooling space yet, there are a couple great deals to look out for this Black Friday.

Black Friday deals on Smart Envi heaters

My favorite new smart heater, the Smart Envi, is a wall-mounted, out-of-the-way bombshell of efficiency, using only 500 watts to heat up to 150 feet. Today, it's 30%. My hot tip: Their larger 1000 watt heater, the Smart Envi Max, will ship in early 2024 and is available on pre-order, also for 30% off. Use code BF23 at checkout for savings.

Black Friday deals on Govee heaters

I don’t love everything about the Govee experience, but I recently reviewed two of their new heaters and enjoyed them well enough. They heat really well, all while being controlled from your phone. In particular, I love the Smart Space Heater Lite for its ability to heat a decently sized space without taking up a ton of space itself.

Black Friday deals on Boldr heaters

There aren’t many companies in the smart heating space, but Boldr has made a name as the prettiest of the bunch. I haven’t tested this brand yet, but reviews have been positive.

Black Friday deals on Dyson fans and heaters

Few products impressed me this year as much as the Dyson Hot+Cool Purifier. In my review , I noted how the heater function never dried out the space and felt instead like a warm breeze; and I loved the 350 degree oscillation.

Black Friday deals on Midea A/Cs

Each year, I’ve purchased another of the top rated A/C units from Midea, the U shaped A/C that comes in a few sizes. It allows you to keep your window functional, comes with its own installation kit that remains year-round, and can utilize all kinds of schedules, automations, and functions through its own app. It also supports Google and Alexa, if you prefer.

Black Friday deals on Whynter A/Cs

Whynter’s lineup of portable A/Cs has added wifi connectivity in the last few years, and a number of their models are on sale for Black Friday at Best Buy and Home Depot. If you lack the windows for a pass-through A/C, these are an excellent alternative.

Black Friday deals on GE A/Cs

Most appliances by GE are now supported by smart functionality, including smart window A/Cs. These units look and act a lot like your standard window A/C, with added support from the SmartHQ app. </textarea>
