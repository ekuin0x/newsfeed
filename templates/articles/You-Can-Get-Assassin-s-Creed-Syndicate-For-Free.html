                <textarea id="text" readonly> Assassin’s Creed Syndicate is free for a short period of time.

To celebrate the start of the holiday shopping season, Ubisoft has announced that it is giving away the game on PC through December 6. All you have to do is go to the Ubisoft Store and claim it before 1pm EST on the aforementioned date.

Released in 2015 for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate is set in Victorian London. Twin assassins Jacob and Evie Frye fight to take down the Templars and take back control of the city for the people of London.

“London, 1868 – The Industrial Revolution fattens the purses of the privileged while the working class struggles to survive – until an Assassin emerges from the underworld to rally to their defense,” the game’s description reads. “Rise to lead the world’s first organized crime family. Conquer the streets of London. Bring the ruling class to their knees.”

When it was released, the game received “generally favorable” reviews from critics and currently holds a 76 on Metacritic. Its user score is slightly lower at 6.9, signaling a mixed score from players.
