Afghanistan and Pakistan will warm-up for the Asia Cup 2023 and World Cup 2023 with a three-match ODI series across two venues in Sri Lanka from August 22 to August 26.

The first two matches will be hosted at the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium in Hambantota, while the third and final match will be played at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.

This will be Afghanistan's first ODI assignment since last month's 2-1 away series win against Bangladesh, while Pakistan will be playing their first ODI series since their 2-1 home series win against New Zealand in May.

The two sides clashed earlier this year in a three match T20I series in Sharjah, where Afghanistan claimed a 2-1 series win over a Pakistan team, that missed Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan and Shaheen Afridi.

Babar returns to lead Pakistan with Shadab Khan serving as his deputy, while Afghanistan, who will be the hosts of this series, will continue to be led by Hashmatullah Shahidi. Here is a look at the PAK vs AFG 2023 ODI Series Squads, Schedule, Telecast & Live Streaming Info:
