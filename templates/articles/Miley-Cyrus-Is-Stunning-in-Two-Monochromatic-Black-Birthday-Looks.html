                <textarea id="text" readonly> In celebration of the big three-one, Miley Cyrus gifted herself a performance‚Äîand her 215 million followers two sexy birthday looks.

To commemorate her special day, which coincided with Thanksgiving on Thursday, the hitmaker hosted an intimate pre-birthday concert for her family and friends at Los Angeles‚Äô Chateau Marmont hotel on Tuesday.

Cyrus stunned in not just one monochromatic black ensemble, but two. She took to Instagram to share photos and videos of herself in both.

The ‚ÄúUsed To Be Young‚Äù singer put a modern twist on a glamorous Old Hollywood outfit, wearing a sheer bustier, matching pencil skirt, cropped blazer by Neiman Marcus, and strappy heels. She made her look even more luxe with elbow length gloves, big framed sunglasses by Versace, gold drop earrings, and a leopard purse by Neiman Marcus.

For her performance, she kept the opera gloves on, but changed into a sultry, figure-hugging, strapless LBD. For both looks, she pulled her brunette locks back into a sleek low bun.

‚ÄúMy birthday gift to MYSELF this year was VERY on brand. I performed for MYSELF and sang my favorite songs including my own,‚Äù she captioned her Instagram post. ‚ÄúFirst ‚Äòlive‚Äô performance of Flowers was to an audience full of my friends and family. Taking this song back to the seed‚Ä¶ she sprouted sensationally. Grateful for the growth in us both. üåπüíã‚ù§Ô∏è With Love, Miley‚Äù

Cyrus showcased her powerful vocals, backed by a piano, in a romantic, candle-lit space. In addition to ‚ÄúFlowers,‚Äù she later indulged in a rock throwback with ‚ÄúFaithfully‚Äù by Journey. </textarea>
