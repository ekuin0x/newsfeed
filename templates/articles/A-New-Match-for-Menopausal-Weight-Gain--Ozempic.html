                <textarea id="text" readonly> Women going through menopause raise concerns about weight and body changes almost as often as they do about hot flashes and night sweats, said Dr. Stephanie Faubion, medical director for the Menopause Society and a director of the Mayo Clinic’s Center for Women’s Health. “They come in, and they’re often in tears about it. They don’t know what’s happening,” she said. Some estimates suggest that roughly 70 percent of women gain up to 1.5 pounds per year during the menopause transition, which can last as long as a decade.

This weight gain can affect women’s self-esteem and quality of life and can also increase the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other health issues. Excess weight is also correlated with more hot flashes and night sweats; the Menopause Society recommends weight loss as an effective nonhormonal treatment for those symptoms.

Now, some women going through menopause are seeking drugs like Ozempic, despite the steep costs: Without insurance coverage, the drugs can run around $1,000 a month. “We’re getting requests daily,” Dr. Faubion said.

And some doctors are beginning to oblige. Given the prevalence of obesity in the United States, “a majority of midlife women actually meet the criteria to receive these medications,” said Dr. Daniela Hurtado, an assistant professor of medicine, endocrinologist and obesity medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic.

Experts worry that these medications — which are relatively new, and whose long-term effects are still being studied — may exacerbate the loss of muscle mass and bone density already common among menopausal women, potentially putting them at greater risk for fractures, falls and osteoporosis. </textarea>
