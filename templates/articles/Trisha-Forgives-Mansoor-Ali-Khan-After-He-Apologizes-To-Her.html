                <textarea id="text" readonly> LEO actor Mansoor Ali Khan’s expressed his disappointment for not having ‘rape’ scenes with Trisha in the movie. Trisha condemned his statements and many others voiced their support to her.

Mansoor who earlier did not want to apologize took it to social media and finally apologized to her. Mansoor was denied bail by the court and then he asked for forgiveness from Trisha. In the statement, he said, ‘The woman police officer told me that Trisha had been hurt… I told her that even I am.’

Mansoor in his apology wrote, ‘Mu co-actress Trisha, Please forgive me! May God bless the fortune for me to bless your Mangalyam as it goes around in the coconut tray in the auspicious marital ritual! Amen.’

Trisha reacted to it and wrote on Twitter, ‘To err is human, to forgive is divine.’ The controversy seems to have ended with Trisha accepting the apology from Mansoor Ali Khan. </textarea>
