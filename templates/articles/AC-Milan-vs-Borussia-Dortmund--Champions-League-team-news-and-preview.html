                <textarea id="text" readonly> Borussia Dortmund will travel to Milan on Tuesday with the opportunity to secure their place in the UEFA Champions League round of 16.

A fascinating away game awaits Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday as they take on Italian giants AC Milan. The Black and Yellows will go into the fixture knowing that a win would be enough to help them qualify for the CL round of 16.

Borussia Dortmund came from behind to return to winning ways on Saturday, as they beat Borussia Mönchengladbach 4-2. Despite the result, BVB’s performance showed that there is still plenty of room for improvement. And Edin Terzic will hope for a more disciplined defensive performance from his side on Tuesday.

The trip to Milan is set to kick-start a run of five matches that could well make or break Borussia Dortmund’s season. BVB will be without Felix Nmecha once again on Tuesday, although Sebastien Haller and Karim Adeyemi could return to the squad after missing the Gladbach game due to illness.

Jamie Bynoe-Gittens will hope to start once again after impressing against Gladbach. Salih Özcan and Donyell Malen could also be in contention for a spot in the starting XI.

AC Milan have been forced to deal with a raft of injuries in recent weeks. They will once again have to make do without star forward Rafael Leão on Tuesday, while Noah Okafor is also sidelined. Yunus Musah will miss the game through suspension after accumulating three yellow cards in the group stage.

Former Borussia Dortmund winger Christian Pulisic is set to start for Milan on Tuesday, while Olivier Giroud should also return after missing the 1-0 win over Fiorentina on Saturday through suspension.

The two sides played out a goalless draw when they met at the Westfalenstadion on matchday two of the Champions League group stage.

AC Milan vs Borussia Dortmund: Predicted Starting XIs

AC Milan: Maignan – Calabria, Thiaw, Tomori, Hernandez – Krunic, Reijnders – Chukweuze, Loftus-Cheek, Pulisic – Giroud

Borussia Dortmund: Kobel – Ryerson, Hummels, Schlotterbeck, Bensebaini – Özcan, Can, Brandt – Reus, Bynoe-Gittens – Füllkrug </textarea>
