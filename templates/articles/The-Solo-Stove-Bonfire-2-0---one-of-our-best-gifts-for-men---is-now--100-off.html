As the weather gets colder, and fall turns to winter, there’s nothing quite so nice as sitting by the fire.

The catch? Not all of us are blessed with a fireplace in our homes. And your backdoor space may not be quite spacious enough to accomodate a firepit.

But you’re doubly lucky today. Because there’s a solution, and it’s Black Friday, so the solution is on sale. Enter: the Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0, which “pushes the limits of both combustion airflow efficiency and minimalist outdoor design with its all stainless steel construction,” according to Solo Stove. We couldn’t have put it better ourselves.

This Black Friday, pick yourself up a bonfire that fits in every back yard for a fraction of the price. Buy from Solo Stove directly, and save over $100 off this nearly smokeless bonfire that allows for all of the bonfire fun with none of the woodsmoke smell in your clothes.

Did we light a fire in you to check out even more deals? Check out Solo Stove’s store to see what other Black Friday goodies the brand is offering up.

Whether you’re camping, or just setting up camp in the backyard, the Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0 with Stand is the ideal accompaniment to a night spent outdoors. Buy this Black Friday, and spend more time by the fire this season.
