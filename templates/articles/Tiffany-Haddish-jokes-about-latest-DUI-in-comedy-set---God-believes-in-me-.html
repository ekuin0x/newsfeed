                <textarea id="text" readonly> Hours after she was arrested on suspicion of DUI, Tiffany Haddish addressed the incident during a comedy set Friday at the Laugh Factory in Long Beach, California.

According to audio obtained by TMZ, an audience member eagerly asked the “Girls Trip” star, 43, about her early Friday morning arrest in Beverly Hills. She was allegedly found asleep at the wheel while the car engine was still running.

“What happened last night?” Haddish repeated as the crowd roared with delight. “Ah, damn.”

“You tell me,” she continued. “I don’t know.”

The “Haunted Mansion” actress joked that her prayers to be with a man in uniform had certainly been answered.

“I prayed to God to send me a man with a job,” she joked, “preferably in a uniform.”

“God answered my prayers,” she said, delivering the punchline to outrageous applause.

“Because God believes in me,” she added.

The Post reached out to Haddish reps for comment.

Following Friday’s set, Haddish was spotted climbing into the backseat of a black SUV with producer Jeff Beacher. Both appeared to be in good spirits.

Haddish wore an off-the-shoulder silky red top with hoop earrings decorated with a pendant and an Apple Watch.

Beacher, 50, wore a dark top that matched his black shades.

Haddish’s Friday punchline mirrors a joke she told on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” following her 2022 DUI arrest in Georgia.

“I can say this, Jimmy… I’ve been praying to God to send me a new man. A good man. And God went ahead and sent me four… in uniform,” Haddish told Fallon in January 2022.

“And now I got a really great lawyer, and we’re going to work it out. I’ve got to get my asking of things to God a little better!”

Haddish was arrested in Georgia for allegedly falling asleep behind the wheel on a highway.

She’s suspected of being under the influence of marijuana.

She is due in court Dec. 4 for that case, TMZ reports.

In her latest arrest, following a Thanksgiving event at Los Angeles’ Laugh Factory, the actress’ vehicle was “stopped in lanes of traffic,” according to police.

“We responded to a call of a vehicle on the roadway at 5:45 this morning,” a Beverly Hills police spokesperson told Page Six. “The investigation led us to arrest her for a DUI.”

No one was reported injured.

Haddish was released from custody that afternoon with a citation. </textarea>
