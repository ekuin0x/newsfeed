                <textarea id="text" readonly> Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have reunited after spending a little time apart while Swift finished the South American leg of her Eras tour. Us Weekly reported that Swift landed in Kansas City, Missouri, on Monday to see Kelce. She completed her last Eras show in São Paulo, Brazil, just one day before and will not resume her tour until February.

Swift’s arrival comes as People published a new report detailing why Swift and Kelce’s appreciation for each other’s careers makes their relationship work so well.

Kelce’s loved ones see serious potential in him and Swift. “Travis’ friends think this is the real deal for him,” a source close to Kelce said. “They’re still a little shocked by all of it—that he’s dating the Taylor Swift, but they’ve seen how down to earth she is with his friends and family.”

The source added their strong work ethics have only strengthened their connection: “They’re both really hard workers, and he acknowledges her art is hers, and he has what’s his,” the source said. “He understands the territory their relationship comes with and, like he said, isn’t letting any of the hoopla impact how they’re growing together.”

The source added, “Their relationship is about the two of them, and he sees Taylor for who she is and vice versa.”

Last week, a source told Us Weekly that Swift and Kelce plan to spend the holidays together and have discussed how they will handle periods where they are long distance due to their work commitments. “They have very detailed plans coming up while she’s on tour and he has games,” that source detailed. “Taylor and Travis have the next few months completely laid out. They don’t want to start their relationship off with big gaps [in time spent apart]. They’re trying to be as much like a regular couple as possible.”
