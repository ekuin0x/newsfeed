                <textarea id="text" readonly> I remember waking up early every single Black Friday as a kid — like 4 a.m. early — and driving to the nearest department store with my family to shop all of the doorbusters. Ahh, the nostalgia. There was something so special (albeit crazy) about getting up at the crack of dawn to buy massively discounted staples (like Ugg boots!!), coming home, passing out on the couch, eating turkey leftovers, and then relishing in your bargain buys.

These days, I don’t wake up quite so early to go into a store — and with Black Friday deals hitting extra early, there isn’t really the concept of a “doorbuster” anymore. But there are still great, jaw-dropping deals out there, and though I’ve turned into a pretty picky shopper (I won’t just buy any ol’ thing anymore just because it’s a good price), I think I found the best deal on the internet: my favorite cozy, cuddly Hanes sweatshirt for $8 that I’m stocking up on because it would simply be silly not to do so.

Hanes Soft-Fleece EcoSmart Long-Sleeve Sweatshirt in Light Steel

Whenever I work from home, go on my walks, or feel like having a lazy Sunday, you can most often find me in a sweatshirt. It’s one of my most-used basics — I think this fact is important to mention because it’s also made me somewhat of a sweatshirt snob. Hey, I know what I want, and I know a good sweatshirt; the Hanes Soft-Fleece EcoSmart pick isn’t just good, it’s great. So yes, I’m stocking up, and yes, I’m buying it in multiple colors, too.

When I say this sweatshirt is soft, I mean it. It’s made from a plush mid-weight cotton-blend that basically feels like a big bear hug (I promise). The comfort is obviously there — Hanes is a mastermind of comfort, after all — but it’s also quietly stylish, too. Sweatshirts can quickly lean frumpy and sloppy, but this crewneck doesn’t. It has a more fitted silhouette than you might be used to with your cozies, plus eye-catching ribbed detailing along the cuff, collar, and waistband that gives it some refinement.

I’m not the only one who’s in love with this sweatshirt either. It has amassed more than 38,000 five-star ratings on Amazon, and thousands of five-star ratings, with shoppers calling the “perfect basic” “one of the coziest things ever” — and I couldn’t agree more.

The Hanes sweatshirt normally costs $18, which isn’t too bad, but right now, it’s marked down to $10 — who knew you still could get anything for just $8 anymore? This price won’t last long — and neither will stock in all sizes — so stock up now. I promise you’ll be living in it all season long.
