                <textarea id="text" readonly> The Black Friday mayhem is over now but if you've missed out on some of the best deals on Samsung's products, fret not, the company has got you covered. Black Friday is followed by Cyber Monday which is also over, but Samsung is taking it one step further this year with Cyber Week.

There are plenty of great Samsung Cyber Week 2023 deals on offer. You can pick up some of the hottest Samsung products on the market at significant discounts. This is your time to buy a Samsung product and you can't get a better price anywhere else other than Samsung.com.

Smartphones

From the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5 foldables to the exceptional camera capabilities of the Galaxy S23 Ultra, you're spoiled for choice by Samsung's 2023 smartphone lineup. The company is offering guaranteed lowest prices of the year through its online store, with exceptional trade-in values and stackable offers that give you the most bang for your buck. Here are a few of our favorite deals:

Galaxy Z Fold 5: 25% off + a free memory upgrade with prices starting at just $1,349. You can even get $1000 trade-in credit for an existing device, thus paying just $349 for a new foldable.

Galaxy Z Flip 5: Buy Samsung's clamshell foldable for just $749 with up to $600 in trade-in credit offered, for a final price of just $149.

Galaxy S23 Ultra: If best-in-class camera performance is what you want, buy the Galaxy S23 Ultra, starting at $899, plus also get an enhanced trade-in credit of up to $800, to pay just $99 for the new phone.

Galaxy S23 FE: Samsung's solid affordable flagship is within reach as you can now buy the Galaxy S23 FE for $539, if you can snag the $400 trade-in value, you'll only pay $139 of pocket.

Tablets

Samsung recently overhauled its entire high-end tablet lineup and this year's iterations are some of the best we've seen so far. They are priced a bit on the higher side and if you were on the fence about buying then because of this, now is the perfect time to pick on up as you won't find better prices anywhere.

Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra: Get a free storage upgrade for the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra at $1,199 and if you trade in a device for the maximum $700 value, your out of pocket cost is only $499 for what's arguably the best Android tablet on the market.

Galaxy Tab S9 FE: Not everyone needs a bonkers tablet and for them, buying the Galaxy Tab S9 FE makes perfect sense. Not only do you get a $50 discount on the usual price, but if you trade a device for up to $350, you'll only pay $49 for the new tablet.

Smartwatches

Samsung makes some of the best Wear OS-powered smartwatches on the market. The company has consistently raised the bar in this market and its latest models are no different. If you had your eye on the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro from last year, you'll want to buy one at these unbelievable prices.

Galaxy Watch 6: You can buy Samsung's latest smartwatch for up to $80 off the usual price. You also get enhanced trade-in values of up to $250, potentially paying less than $70 for a brand new smartwatch.

Galaxy Watch 5 Pro: 2022's Galaxy Watch 5 Pro set a new standard for battery and activity-focused features. It can now be yours for $90 off and with enhanced trade-in values, you may only have to pay very little out of pocket to get it.

TVs

As the best TV vendor in the business, you can go wrong with a Samsung TV. The company makes conventional as well as lifestyle TVs, offering a perfect blend of style and substance. The holiday season is great for buying TVs since you can get great deals on them, and Samsung is now offering some of the best deals we've seen all year on its TVs.

The Frame: If you like this TV because of its understated artsy aesthetic, this is the right time to buy The Frame TV, as you can save up to $1000 on any of the various models on offer.

Neo QLED 4K: This particular lineup was revamped earlier this year with the latest display and 4K processing technology. Right now, you can save up to $2,200 on Samsung's Neo QLED 4K TVs.

QLED 4K: This series is a mainstay of Samsung's high-end TV offerings. The company is offering up to $3,000 off QLED 4K TVs as part of the exclusive Cyber Week 2023 deals.

The deals don't end there. You have plenty more products to save money on, from wireless earbuds to home appliances like refrigerators, washing machines, and more. These deals are only available for a limited time and exclusively through Samsung.com, so make sure to place your orders there to avail the lowest prices of the season on Samsung's best products. </textarea>
