Tiffany Trump‚Äôs latest outing shows how different she is from the rest of her family, especially when it comes to the holiday season.

More from SheKnows

On Nov 23, Tiffany‚Äôs mom Marla Maples shared a series of photos on her Instagram, showing her family‚Äôs cozy holiday. She shared the photos with the caption reading, ‚ÄúüçÅ Thanksgiving Day üçÅ Oh the joy of simple times with beloved friends & family. Thank you Carmen, for hosting us as we brought our favorite dishes and shared the flavors, prayers, and fun! I had to add a photo of my family in Georgia who we missed so much this year, but so happy they could be together‚Ä¶ I love you, baby sister, Dean, little Liam and my daddy Stan‚ù£Ô∏è.‚Äù

In the first photo, we see Maples and Tiffany posing together in their casual looks, with Tiffany in a baby blue shirt, ripped jeans, black belt, and mocassins. Then we get another snapshot of them inside Maples‚Äôs house with her friends Anette Halfon and Carmen Anderson.

Now, this cozy holiday meal is quite different from what we‚Äôve seen of Tiffany‚Äôs half-siblings. While they‚Äôre all in sunny Miami, her brother Eric Trump and sister Ivanka Trump decided to utilize the fun in the sun, and had a more beachy Thanksgiving.

The Trump Card author shared a series of photos of her and her children in the pool of their $24 million mansion.

And Eric‚Äôs wife Lara Trump shared the family‚Äôs Thanksgiving excursion: with a family beach photo reading, ‚ÄúThanksgiving Florida style üåä.‚Äù

Not only does this show how the siblings celebrate, but it shows what they gravitate towards. While Eric and Ivanka post to social about their family time in high places, Tiffany keeps it low-key with just her closest family member and her pals.

Along with that, quite a few of Tiffany‚Äôs siblings decided to use Thanksgiving to take jabs at US President Joe Biden. (Just go on Donald Trump Jr and Lara‚Äôs Instagram pages, and you‚Äôll see what we‚Äôre talking about instantly).

Despite the musings of Tiffany being closer to certain family members, these posts show that she is quite different from her controversial siblings.
