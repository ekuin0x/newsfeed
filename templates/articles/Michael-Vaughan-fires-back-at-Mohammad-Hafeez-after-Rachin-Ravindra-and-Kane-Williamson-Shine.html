                <textarea id="text" readonly> Former England captain Michael Vaughan has fired back at ex-Pakistan captain Mohammad Hafeez following Hafeez’s criticism of Vaughan mocking Pakistan cricket. The exchange unfolded on social media as tensions rose ahead of Pakistan’s clash with New Zealand on November 3 in the ongoing World Cup 2023.

Hafeez had initially slammed Vaughan for “peeping into others’ problems” after the Englishman commented on Pakistan’s poor bowling performance. Vaughan had tweeted, “Looks like Pakistan need the chairman of selectors back… All seam in a day game in Bangalore… !!!!!! #Bonkers #CWC2023 #Pakistan. What do you reckon @MHafeez22?”

Looks like Pakistan need the chairman of selectors back .. All seam in a day game in Bangalore .. !!!!!! #Bonkers #CWC2023 #Pakistan … What do you reckon @MHafeez22 ? — Michael Vaughan (@MichaelVaughan) November 4, 2023

In response, Hafeez advised Vaughan on a social media platform (‘X’) to focus on resolving internal issues instead of meddling in others’ problems. He posted, “Better stop peeping into other’s problems and sort out ur disputes first. We have sizeable insight about our issues and will surely resolve them @MichaelVaughan.”

Vaughan, undeterred, took to the same platform to playfully express concern about the calm in the Pakistan dressing room, joking that someone should either resign or leak a WhatsApp message. He stated, “I worry about Pakistan tomorrow. It’s been too calm this last couple of days. They need someone to resign today or leak a WhatsApp message.”

This exchange follows Vaughan’s previous criticism of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) when personal WhatsApp messages of Pakistan captain Babar Azam were exposed online. </textarea>
