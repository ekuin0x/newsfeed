                <textarea readonly> Israel will be the first stop for German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier as he begins his two-day trip to the Middle East on Sunday.

Steinmeier will be traveling to Israel, Oman and Qatar. His first meeting will be with Israeli counterpart Isaac Herzog for political discussions, according to his office.

In a video message released on Saturday, Steinmeier said he wanted to show his support for Israel following the deadly terror attacks of October 7 by the Islamist Hamas militant group.

"No one can deny Israel the right to fight terror decisively," Steinmeier said. However, he also added that fighting was causing immense suffering among unarmed civilians in the Gaza Strip.

"Every precaution to get civilians out of the line of fire is necessary. In addition, there is the supply of the most vital necessities. That is what international humanitarian law demands, and that is what we Germans also expect," Steinmeier said. </textarea>
