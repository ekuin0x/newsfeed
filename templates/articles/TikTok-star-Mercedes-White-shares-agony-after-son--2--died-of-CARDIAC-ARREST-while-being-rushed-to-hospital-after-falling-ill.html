                <textarea id="text" readonly> A TikTok star has shared her anguish after her beloved two year-old son died of cardiac arrest earlier this month.

Mercedes White took to Facebook following the death of her boy Wesley, writing: 'He was it for me. I wanted only one babyâ€¦ and now heâ€™s gone. I donâ€™t know how to process this. He slept with us since the day we brought him home,

White, from Louisiana, continued: 'I cuddled him every night. I keep waiting for his little feet to kick me in the back.

'Little piece of him are all over our house but he will never be here again. I thought I had more time with him. I wanted to be better for him.

Prominent TikTok book reviewer Mercedes White's only son died on November 10, and the mom has provided new details about the sudden death in a series of posts to social media

'He deserved more than this. Nothing feels right, my baby is gone. Hug your little ones a little tighter for me.'

The grieving mom said Wesley had died after falling ill, then suffering from a cardiac arrest as he was rushed to hospital. Further details of his condition and death have not been shared.

White shot to fame as a 'booktoker,' who shares book news and reviews of novels she's enjoyed, with the trend credited with helping save the publishing industry and launch careers.

In another, the content creator - whose handle is @bookclubwannabe - lamented the loss of her 'one [and] only' child, recalling how he had 'slept with [she and her husband] since the day we brought him home.'

White offered little else and had never before mentioned her son suffering from congenital heart problems. She buried him on November 17, one post revealed, after raising more than $41,000 for his funeral.

In one , the Louisiana mom - who gave birth just over two years ago - spoke about how the child tragically passed away on their way to the hospital in a desperate attempt to save his life

@bookclubwannabe My heart is unbelievable broken. Wesley was the best baby anyone could ask for. To the Booktok communityâ€¦. I donâ€™t deserve any of you. Three months ago i started this account because I was a SAHM and i had no friends and just wanted to talk about book. Its funny how little decisions in our life impact our future. the support from all of you guysâ€¦. I have no words. I dont know how to go on from here. I wish there was a rule book on grief. I am incredibly angry, im confused and im so fucking devastated. My heart physical aches. I never really shared Wesley on here because i wanted go keep him alllll to myself. Heres a little glimpse at my baby boy. Fuck i miss him â™¬ original sound - mercedesðŸ“š

White shared to Facebook a few days earlier: 'My heart is absolutely shattered. Getting on here and seeing all your love for Wesley is just so overwhelming.'

She continued: 'I will never understand it but Wesley suffered some sort of cardiac arrest.

'We were on the way to the hospital and things just went terribly down hill.

'I will love him forever.'

The post, published on November 10, did not provide any more insight into the child's death, which was only revealed hours earlier, in another post to the influencer's social media.

In it, the mom-of-one conceded she '[didn't'] know what to do with [herself]' after Wesley's sudden passing, which happened earlier that morning and struck her and her husband by surprise.

Having since resumed reviewing for her some 155,300 followers, she wrote at the time, 'Wesley lost his life this morning and I truly canâ€™t not understand why.'

'All I know,' she went on while posting a GoFundMe link, 'is I have to put my baby in the ground.'

'I canâ€™t sit around and do anything else until this is figured out. Anything helps.'

In another, the content creator - whose handle is @bookclubwannabe - lamented the loss of her 'one [and] only' child, recalling how he had 'slept with [she and her husband] since the day we brought him home'

The child, seen here with father Cameron, was buried on November 17. Fans of White - who has roughly 155,000 followers - successfully raised more than $41,000 for his funeral

White said of the child's sudden passing: 'I will never understand it but Wesley suffered some sort of cardiac arrest. We were on the way to the hospital and things just went terribly down hill. I will love him forever'. The family had chronicled much of their recent travels online

@bookclubwannabe Theres tons of pictures and videos i want to share of welsey but these are aome on my favorite. Thank you to everyone who has reached out.im not sure when ill return to booktok but you guys have helped me in more ways then you realize. â™¬ original sound - mercedesðŸ“š

White went on of Wesley: 'He slept with us since the day we brought him home, I cuddled him every night. I keep waiting for his little feet to kick me in the back. Little piece[s] of him are all over our house but he will never be here again'

The mother has since resumed her social media pursuits, posting three book-related TikToks over the past three days. Her GoFundMe, as of Sunday, has successfully raised $41,444

@bookclubwannabe I love you all from the bottom of my heart â™¬ original sound - mercedesðŸ“š

A day later, after sharing an emotional slideshow of the family's travels and experiences over the past two years, White took to TikTok, her platform of choice, to provide a more in-depth update on her emotional state.

There, a week after her son had passed away, she revealed that she and her husband had just returned from the tot's funeral service, which she labeled a 'celebration of his life.'

She conceded that while the occasion was somber, 'it was great to see family and friends and...everyone so affected by this.'

Calling Wesley's death 'f**king terrible,' she thanked her fans - whom she affectionately refers to as her 'book talk' - for having her back.

'I'm absolutely blown away,' she said of the heartfelt response, after onlookers within days provided the $30,000 she had asked for the help incur the cost of burying her son, who she revealed was cremated.

'I don't think I really deserve you guys', she conceded, ' but I am forever grateful for how this community came and helped me. I will never forget that.'

The mother has since resumed her social media pursuits, posting three book-related TikToks over the past three days.

Her GoFundMe, as of Sunday, has successfully raised $41,444.

She wrote to followers in a caption on her earlier post. 'I love you all from the bottom of my heart.' </textarea>
