                <textarea id="text" readonly> She is on a mission to teach older women the importance of moving their bodies

A 60-year-old mom-of-seven has been flaunting her toned abs and enviable physique as she attempts to show older women that keeping your body moving is an important part of the aging process.

Dalyce Radtke, from Chandler, Arizona, is a fitness fanatic who never misses a day of exercise.

Now, the full-time personal trainer is trying to ignite a passion for health and movement to seniors by sharing her methods on social media, where she has become a viral sensation and boasts 400,000 followers.

After starting menopause at the age of 50, Dalyce learned how important staying active was for your health and made it her mission to teach others.

The 60-year-old mom has been 'all about fitness' since she was in 20s, and doesn't seem to be stopping any time soon.

And throughout the years, she has made sure to prioritize moving her body - even during the busiest days.

She said: 'I've been all about fitness since my early 20s because, to me, it's a two-way street: feeling good means looking good, and vice versa.

'Working out has become as natural as brushing my teeth in my daily routine. This dedication only got stronger with each of my pregnancies.

'No matter how hectic life gets with seven kids, I sneak in a 5â€“10-minute workout, whether after the kids are tucked in or bright and early before they wake up.'

When she began menopause at 50, she was happy her symptoms were 'relatively light.'

She noted that she had 'hot flashes' and struggled sleeping through the night, but was grateful that like her mother Edna, who is also continuously moving her body, she didn't have worse symptoms.

Dalyce explained: 'I started menopause at 50. I was lucky that my symptoms were relatively light, similar to those of my mom, Edna, who at 91 is still a fitness fanatic. Aside from hot flushes, the worst symptom I had was restless sleep.

'Working out has become as natural as brushing my teeth in my daily routine. This dedication only got stronger with each of my pregnancies,' she said

'But menopause is different for everyone. For many women, it can slow metabolism, affect bone density, and lead to joint pain.

'That's why staying active during and after menopause is important.'

According to Permanente Medical Group, exercising during menopause will help increase your mood and help you sleep better due to the endorphins that are released during physical activity.

When Edna lost her daily physical routine due to the mandatory retirement regulations in Canada, Dalyce noted a significant decline in her energy and saw her mom push through and remain active.

Seeing her mother continuing to challenge herself makes Dalyce proud as she is now also Edna's personal trainer.

She explained: 'When mandatory retirement hit at 65, as per Canada's regulations, my mom lost her daily physical routine, which led to a noticeable decline in her strength and energy, so she took action.

'She lives by the mantra, "Keep moving or risk losing the ability to move." She remains active, shoveling snow in the winter, driving to the gym, and gardening during spring and summer. She's conscious about not sitting too long, often getting up for walks.'

Dalyce was shocked to see her mother still moving and helped her with various exercises to keep her motivated.

The 60-year-old mom-of-seven frequently lifts weights, does ab workouts, and makes sure to stretch every day

In 2020, she began posting fitness-related content on her TikTok, which is tailored for menopausal women

She added: 'As her daughter and a personal trainer, I've provided her with exercises and various challenges to keep her motivated. But honestly, her zest for life and commitment to her health that motivates me.'

Now, Dalyce has incorporated those same workouts in her routine.

In 2020, she began posting fitness-related content on her TikTok, which is tailored for menopausal women.

She said: 'Before the pandemic, I wasn't really active on social media. But when COVID-19 forced me to put a hold on my one-on-one training sessions, I continued my personal workouts at home.

'My son and his girlfriend were already quite the social media stars, who suggested I start sharing my home workout routines online.'

And before she knew it, she was a viral sensation for sharing her low-impact workouts that helped women move their bodies.

She added: 'Once I began posting, especially on TikTok, my following grew faster than I could have imagined' (shown at age 30)

In addition to workout routines, Dalyce also openly shares her experience with plastic surgery with her followers. Recently, she had a jowls, lip, and neck lift

'Despite maintaining physical fitness, you can't fight gravity, no matter how much you exercise or how well you eat,' she admitted.

She added: 'I wanted my appearance to reflect how youthful I felt inside. I feel as good, if not better than I did in my 30s and 40s. But I'm also realistic; I don't aim to look 30 or 40. I'm not trying to deceive anyone - my oldest child is 35.

'I view cosmetic procedures as no different to wearing makeup, hair extensions, acrylic nails, or Spanx. It's not about changing who you are, but enhancing what you already have.'

Dalyce's love for fitness led her to meet her husband, Paul, who is 13 years her junior. The couple have two children together. Paul plays an instrumental role in the lives of Radtke's five other children from a previous relationship.

'We first bumped into each other at the gym where I worked as a trainer and fitness instructor. Introduced by mutual friends, we instantly clicked, bonding over our shared interests and love for a healthy lifestyle.

Despite the occasional cougar remark, the couple are 'rock solid' and recently celebrated their 23rd anniversary

'Gradually, our friendship transformed into a romantic relationship. It became clear to me that Paul was the one I wanted to share my life with, especially when I saw his enthusiasm for being part of my world with my five young kids,' she recalled.

Despite the occasional cougar remark, the couple are 'rock solid' and recently celebrated their 23rd anniversary.

'In our relationship, age has never been a big deal. We focus on what genuinely matters for a successful marriage: shared values, common goals, parenting styles, financial harmony, and mutual desires.

'While we sometimes notice our age difference when reminiscing about school days, music, movies, and other nostalgic topics, when it comes to health and energy, everyone who knows us can vouch that I'm the one with more energy.' </textarea>
