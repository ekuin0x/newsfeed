It's time I humanise you, India, because in you, I find a reflection of me. You've been pulled, pushed, conquered, ruled and as you found your freedom, you found your voice. A few decades later, today, you stand tall, not needing anyone's validation, as the fifth largest economy. This award is for you, India and all the Indians here! We are few, but we're enough. This is for you, India. In your history, I find my stories in your strength and your tenacity, I find my grit to my motherland. I am bringing home your Emmy.‚Äù

The untitled film will be directed by Sandeep Modi, under Karan Johar's banner Dharma Productions alongside Ekta's Balaji Motion Pictures.It marks the first collaboration between Karan and Kartik after their fallout during Dostana 2.
