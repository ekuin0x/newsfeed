                <textarea id="text" readonly> Hair loss of about 50–100 hairs daily is normal. However, certain factors including genetics and disease can increase this level of normal hair loss. This can lead to thinning or balding that can become permanent without treatment.

Finding the reason for your hair loss is key to getting the right treatment and improving the problem. When hair loss results from an underlying health issue, drug, or nonmedical factor, fixing the cause can help restore normal growth.

More often, hair loss results from male or female pattern baldness, a common cause of hair loss rooted in genetics and aging. The good news is that there are many options for treating these and other types of hair loss.

Hair loss treatments include oral and topical choices. Laser therapy and hair replacement surgery can also help. With so many options, finding the right treatment involves knowing the cause. Working with a healthcare provider can help you find the best place to start.

This article describes the most common types of hair loss treatments backed by science. It also explains the causes of hair loss and how to improve them.

How to Regrow Thinning Hair or Bald Spots

The best way to regrow thinning hair or bald spots depends on the cause of the problem. Even when the cause is known, it can take months to determine whether a certain treatment can deliver the results you desire. Consulting a healthcare provider can help you start with the best option to achieve optimal results as soon as possible.

The following treatments are the most common.

FDA-Approved Treatments

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the following treatments.

Topical Minoxidil

Rogaine (minoxidil) is the only topical medication that is FDA-approved to stimulate hair growth and slow balding in people of all sexes. It treats the following types of hair loss:

Androgenetic alopecia (male and female pattern hair loss)

(male and female pattern hair loss) Alopecia areata (an autoimmune disease that causes sudden hair loss on your scalp, face, or body)

Telogen effluvium (hair falling out due to an interruption in the body's cycle of hair production)

Anagen effluvium (rapid hair loss from medical treatment)

Cicatricial (scarring alopecia)

Minoxidil can take at least four months and up to a year until you see results. It only delivers results for as long as it's taken. Most new hair is lost within a few months after it's discontinued.

Minoxidil is formulated as a liquid, foam, or spray applied directly to your scalp. Both minoxidil 2% and 5% are FDA-approved for treating hair loss in people of any sex. It is sold as an over-the-counter (OTC) treatment.

Oral Finasteride



Propecia (finasteride) is FDA-approved to treat male pattern hair loss. It is not used to treat hair loss in children or people capable of becoming pregnant, though it is sometimes used on postmenopausal people with less dramatic results.

Finasteride blocks the production of an androgen sex hormone in your scalp that stops hair growth. Results usually take about four months to appear.

The suggested dose of finasteride for hair loss is 1 milligram daily. It must be continued to maintain results. Finasteride is often combined with minoxidil or surgical hair restoration to achieve optimal outcomes.

Low-Level Laser Therapy

Low-level laser therapy, also called cold laser therapy, uses a single light wavelength of 600–1,000 nanometers. The effect alters cells in dormant hair follicles and promotes regrowth. The same technology is used to treat pain management and chronic pain.

Research shows that low-level laser therapy can trigger hair-growth-promoting effects in male and female pattern baldness. There is some evidence that combining low-level laser therapy with topical minoxidil and oral finasteride may enhance results.

Treatments are given using a laser-infused cap or comb. The duration of a given treatment varies by device. The typical course is a session of 15–20 minutes three times a week for six months. Low-level laser therapy is available in the form of at-home consumer devices or in-office professional-grade units.

Janus kinase (JAK) Inhibitors

Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors interfere with the cellular signals that cause the inflammation underlying many diseases. The following JAK inhibitors are FDA-approved to treat severe alopecia areata:

Litfulo ( ritlecitinib ): Treatment for people ages 12 and over

( ): Treatment for people ages 12 and over Olumiant ( baricitinib ): Treatment for adults ages 18 and older

Though these prescription-only drugs don't provide a cure, they can improve hair growth for some adults and adolescents. Both of these prescription-only drugs are taken once daily.

Other Medical Treatments

Medical treatments that may be used for some causes of hair loss include the following.



Antiandrogens

Antiandrogens are widely used to treat female pattern hair loss by stopping hair loss and increasing hair thickness. These medications decrease testosterone production in the adrenal gland.

The most commonly used antiandrogen is Aldactone (spironolactone). It is administered in the following ways:

Oral treatment: 100–200 milligrams daily for females

Topical treatment: gels of 1% and solutions of 5% twice daily for people of any sex

These treatments typically take up to six months to work, with better results at 12 months. For people who are capable of becoming pregnant, it's often prescribed with a birth control pill because it can cause fetal development anomalies.



Corticosteroid Injections

Corticosteroid injections treat people with alopecia areata, lichen planopilaris, and discoid lupus erythematosus. These medications work to counteract the effects of an autoimmune disease so that hair can grow.

Steroids are applied as prescription topical solutions, oral medication, or injections. Treatment with injections, which could involve as many as 80 injections in one session, is reserved for adults. Regrowth can occur within one or two months.

Oral Minoxidil

Research indicates that low-dose oral minoxidil can be a safe and effective treatment of male and female pattern hair loss for people who do not achieve results or can't tolerate the topical form. This drug may have advantages in creating less mess and fewer side effects than topical minoxidil.

In females, new hair growth has been reported at doses from 0.25–1.25 milligrams daily and at doses of 2.5–5 milligrams/day for males. However, oral minoxidil is only FDA-approved for the treatment of hypertension. Its use for the treatment of hair loss is an off-label therapy.

The terms male and female used in this article relate to chromosomal, anatomic, or biological characteristics, not gender identity.

Antifungal Medications

Research indicates that topical ketoconazole, an antifungal medication, can increase hair regrowth in treating male and female pattern baldness. In addition to its antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties, ketoconazole also has antiandrogenic characteristics. Treatment regimens include use once daily, twice daily, and two to three times per week.

If hair loss results from tinea capitis (scalp ringworm), a daily oral antifungal medication may be prescribed for several months to eliminate the fungus completely.

Platelet-Rich Plasma Injections

Research has shown that platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections can effectively reduce hair loss. PRP injections use the healing power of platelets that exist naturally in your blood. Platelets carry growth factors that attract stem cells and blood flow to damaged hair follicles.

PRP injections are administered using the following process:

Your blood is drawn. Your blood is placed into a centrifuge to separate your blood components (plasma, platelets, white blood cells, red blood cells). The platelet-rich layer is injected into your scalp.

After your first procedure, PRP injections are given monthly for three months and then once every three to six months to maintain results.

Hair Transplant Surgery

Hair transplant surgery involves removing healthy hairs on your scalp (typically the back and sides of your scalp) to areas with thinning or no hair.

You may be a good candidate for hair transplant surgery if you meet the following conditions:

Hair growth remains on the sides and back of your head for use as grafts.

You can grow hair on the areas of your scalp with thinning hair.

You have well-defined male or female pattern baldness.

Your hair loss resulted from a scalp injury, scarring, or cosmetic surgery.

Though the transplanted hair is permanent and will grow in new areas, achieving natural-looking results can take six to nine months or longer.

Microneedling

Microneedling is a minimally invasive cosmetic procedure. It uses a handheld, drum-shaped device with hundreds of tiny needles that make microscopic punctures as it is rolled across your scalp. These "micro-injuries" stimulate the affected skin to repair itself naturally by triggering your skin to produce new collagen (a protein found in the skin).

Research shows that microneedling with topical 5% minoxidil or platelet-rich plasma increases total hair count more significantly after 12 weeks of treatment than those treated with 5% minoxidil alone. There are also limited studies that indicate that microneedling alone can promote hair growth effectively.

Natural Treatments

Natural methods to promote hair regrowth include the following.

Supplements

A systematic review of 30 prior human studies suggests that certain nutritional supplements could potentially treat certain types of hair loss. However, researchers noted that these studies had a limited number of participants and lacked a uniformity of design.

The following supplements showed promise for treating hair loss:

Massage

Research indicates that massage can stimulate your scalp and may improve hair thickness. One study showed that a four-minute daily scalp massage improved hair growth, blood flow, and scalp health in people with androgenetic alopecia.

Marine-Derived Protein

A commercial supplement composed of a proprietary oral marine protein (Viviscal Extra Strength) may help promote thicker and fuller hair. It's a blend of shark powder and mollusk powder derived from sustainable marine sources.

In one study, researchers reported that using this marine protein supplement for nine days increased the number of terminal hairs and decreased hair shedding in women with thinning hair in three months.

Fish Oil

Research shows that consuming omega fatty acids can help improve hair density and diameter and reduce hair loss. Results of one study showed that people who consumed a supplement with omega-3, omega-6, and antioxidants can reduce hair loss while improving hair and hair diameter.



Shampoo Ingredients and Hair Loss Despite common claims of providing shiny, healthy-looking hair, many shampoos contain ingredients that can cause harm, resulting in hair loss. Chemicals such as antimicrobial agents, surfactants, and preservatives can damage hair health. If you're having problems with thinning or balding hair, avoid the following shampoo ingredients:

Sulfates

Formaldehyde

Keratin

Dimethicone

Methylene glycol

DMDM hydantoin

When Stimulating Growth, Know Your Hair Loss Causes

Causes of hair loss include the following.

Hereditary Hair Loss

Androgenetic alopecia, or male and female pattern baldness, is the most common cause of hair loss worldwide. It occurs when you inherit genes that cause your hair follicles (what each hair grows out of) to shrink and eventually stop producing hair.

The shrinking that causes hereditary hair loss can begin any time after puberty, but it usually starts later in life. It appears in the following ways:

In females: Hereditary hair loss occurs with a widening part or overall thinning.

In males: Hereditary hair loss occurs as a bald spot on the top of your head or a receding hairline and leads to total baldness.

Treatment can help regrow hair. It can also help stop or slow hair loss. Starting treatment as early as possible can help improve results.

Age

With age, everyone's hair strands shrink and lose pigmentation. Many hair follicles stop producing new hairs. This causes hair to become thin, fine, and lighter in color.

Alopecia Areata

Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition in which your body attacks its hair follicles, causing hair loss. Hair loss can occur on your scalp and anywhere on your body, including your eyelashes and eyebrows or inside your nose and ears.

Cancer Treatment

Certain cancer treatments, like chemotherapy or radiation therapy, may cause you to lose all or almost all of your hair within one to three weeks of starting these therapies. It usually becomes more noticeable within one to two months after the treatment begins. For most people, hair regrowth occurs on its own after the therapy ends.

Childbirth, Illness, or Surgery

Noticeable hair loss that occurs two to three months after experiencing a major body stressor such as surgery or a serious infection is common. This temporary type of hair loss, called telogen effluvium, also occurs after childbirth. Hair usually returns to its normal fullness within six to nine months without treatment.

Cicatricial (Scarring) Alopecia

Cicatricial (scarring) alopecia is an inflammatory condition. It destroys hair follicles, affecting the upper part of the hair follicle where the stem cells and sebaceous glands (oil glands) are found. This makes them unable to grow hair, resulting in permanent hair loss. Cicatricial alopecia can occur as the result of trauma, burns, or a serious infection.

Tinea Capitis

Tinea capitis, also called scalp ringworm, is a fungal infection of your scalp. It's more common in children and causes hair to fall out in patches. It can be circular, leading to bald spots that may get bigger over time. Treatment involves oral antifungal medication to eradicate the fungus so hair regrowth can occur.

Hormonal Imbalance

Hair loss can result from the following causes of a hormonal imbalance:

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

Stopping some types of birth control pills

Menopause

Hypothyroidism (a low level of thyroid hormones) and hyperthyroidism (high levels of thyroid hormones)



Hair loss treatment and restoring a balance of hormones may help hair regrowth.

Dietary Deficiencies

Getting insufficient amounts of the following nutrients can trigger hair loss:

Biotin

Iron

Protein

Zinc

Restoring the missing nutrients to normal levels can typically restore normal health growth.

Certain Types of Hair Care

Certain hair care products and hairstyles can damage hair, leading to hair loss. These factors include chemical treatments, high heat, and hair color. You can also damage your hair by using the following types of hairstyles that pull on your hair:

Cornrows

Ponytails

Dreadlocks

Hair extensions or weaves

Tight braids

Medications

Hair loss can occur as a side effect of the following types of medications:

Blood pressure medicines such as Inderal (propranolol) and Lopressor (metoprolol)

Cholesterol medicines (statins)

Seizure medicines

Blood thinners such as Coumadin (warfarin) and heparin

Acid reflux medicines

Autoimmune Disorders

Autoimmune disorders are a common cause of hair loss. With these conditions, your immune system mistakenly attacks your hair follicles (where hair grows). It can also affect your nails. This type of hair loss can occur on any part of your hair that grows.

In addition to alopecia areata and scarring alopecia, the following autoimmune diseases can cause thinning hair or hair loss:

Excess Vitamin A

Having too much or over-supplementing vitamin A can cause hair loss. Vitamin A toxicity occurs when you consume more than the recommended daily limit of 10,000 international units daily. This condition has been linked to hair loss.

How to Embrace and Grow Into a New Style

Dealing with fragile hair as the result of hair loss or hair regrowth often requires new hair care strategies for treatment and styling. New hair can take months to regrow, even with the most effective treatments.

You may need to consider new hairstyles until full regrowth occurs. In addition, some types of new hair can be fragile and may not be able to withstand the full range of styling products you may have previously used.

Follow these strategies to make the most of your new hair and achieve the best results:

Keep new hair short and easy to style to reduce breakage.

Avoid too much brushing or pulling in hairstyles like braids or ponytails.

Avoid chemical treatments like perms and hair dyes on new hair for the first few months.

Embrace new hair that may have a different texture (curlier, thicker, or finer) than your original hair. This change is often temporary.

Even though you may not need a haircut, consult with a hairstylist who can show you ways to style your hair that can give you the confidence necessary to enjoy your new hair.

Contact the National Alopecia Areata Foundation for the names of support groups that help you with support and resources for dealing with the effects of hair loss.

Unfortunately, some types of hair loss are permanent. Cicatricial alopecia destroys hair follicles, permanently preventing them from growing hair. Treating inflammation in and around affected follicles can help preserve enough hair to cover the affected scalp areas. Accessories such as wigs, hats, and scarves can camouflage your condition.

Dealing with any hair loss can have an emotional impact. It's associated with the following symptoms of psychological problems, which are similar to those that can come with chronic and severe life-threatening diseases:

Anxiety

Depression

Anger

Embarrassment

Decreased confidence

Reduction in work and sexual performance

Social withdrawal

Suicidal tendencies

If you recognize emotional changes, consult a healthcare provider about mental health services that can help you address the emotional aspects of hair loss.

Summary

Treating hair loss is an individualized process that takes time and patience. Though you'll find a wide range of oral and topical treatments, knowing where to start may prove difficult. Finding the reason for your hair loss can help you get the best results. It can also help you determine whether you need treatment at all.

If you notice signs of thinning or balding hair, seek treatment as soon as possible. Before starting any treatment, consult a healthcare provider. Treating a health problem that causes hair loss may mitigate its effect on your hair.

You can also adopt new hairstyles and hair care practices to address your hair loss concerns. Seek help for the emotional impacts of hair loss if they affect your quality of life.
