Example video title will go here for this video

KENNER, La. â€” The Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office says a man at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport in Kenner, La., allegedly escaped through the emergency hatch and ran out onto the tarmac Sunday night.

The plane was still parked at the terminal and had yet to push back from the gate for takeoff.

Witnesses told media that the man opened the over-wing emergency exit door aboard a Southwest Airlines flight, jumped down off the plane, and ran across the tarmac in an attempt to drive away in a service truck before being stopped by authorities.

According to the JPSO, the man was later escorted to a hospital for evaluation.

The man's identity has not been revealed.

So far, there have been no criminal charges issued at this time. However, JPSO said the investigation was referred to federal authorities. </textarea>
