                <textarea id="text" readonly> The Black Friday price is now live ahead of the big day on the new Apple Watch Series 9. Now marked down courtesy of Amazon, Apple’s latest wearable is now dropping down to $354 shipped for the GPS 45mm style. It normally sells for $429, and is now seeing a $75 discount to its second-best price yet. This is not only one of the first chances to save too, but also an extra $25 under the readily-available Black Friday discount. The 41mm GPS is also on sale for $329.99, down from its usual $399 going rate. There are several colorways available for each of the sizes, each of which comes with different band styles, too. Go check out our coverage from 9to5Mac on what’s new this time around, and then head below for more.

Now centered around the new S9 chip, Apple Watch Series 9 arrives with much of the same build as previous models – just with some enhancements. It’ll still provide the same fitness tracking experience as before, but now packs a 3,000-nit screen that can turn all the way down to 1-nit. There’s newfound pinch detection for one-handed interactions with your wearable that just rolled out earlier in the week, as well as a build that is the first carbon neutral release from Apple.

If none of the bands included with today’s Apple Watch discounts are quite the style you’re looking for, you can also just shop all of our favorite band recommendations. Breaking down the best options out there for any style or budget, there’s an assortment of curated leather bands, metal link straps, fitness-ready solutions, and other accessories for Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2.

Apple Watch Series 9 features:

An aluminum Apple Watch Series 9 paired with the latest Sport Loop is carbon neutral. Learn more about Apple’s commitment to the environment at apple.com/2030. Your essential companion for a healthy life is now even more powerful.

Advanced health, safety, and activity features provide powerful insights and help when you need it. And redesigned apps in watchOS give you more information at a glance.
