                <textarea id="text" readonly> For Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Woot (who is owned by Amazon) is offering the best deal on a genuine Apple iPad Pro tablet. You can get a slightly older gen 2021 iPad Pro 128GB tablet with both Wi-Fi and Cellular connectivity for only $809.99. A 2022 iPad Pro with the equivalent specs would run $1200. In fact the least expensive 2022 iPad Pro model with only Wi-Fi (no cellular option) currently costs $1040 at Best Buy, which is $230 more than this model. Note that this iPad is brand new with a full 1 year Apple warranty.

The main difference between this particular 2021 model the newer 2022 model is the processor; the 2021 iPad Pro is equipped with an M1 chip and the 2022 iPad Pro has the M2 chip. The M2 chip boasts a 15% faster CPU and 35% faster GPU. However keep in mind that the 2021 iPad Pro with the M1 chip had already been the fastest tablet at the time. The vast majority of people (including mobile gamers) would hardly scoff at the M1's performance. Unless you're a pro who uses the iPad Pro as part of your photography, video or audio editing, or graphics workflow, you probably don't need to pay $200+ for the upgrade.

Although the processor might be different, the display is identical. Both models are equipped with a gorgeous 12.9" 2048x2732 (265ppi) Liquid Retina XDR Mini-LED display that cannot be found on any other iPad. This is one of the nicest displays you'll find on a tablet. The new 2022 model hasn't moved towards OLED or Micro LED, so you'd still have to wait another year or two to see any potential display upgrades.

Is this better than Apple Store Cyber Monday deals?

Definitely. The Apple Store Cyber Monday Sale promotion is up to a $100 Apple gift card with the purchase of select iPad models. That's nowhere near as good as Woot's deal.
