Gold prices rose on Friday, on track for their second consecutive weekly gain, with a boost from a drop in the U.S. dollar and bets the U.S. Federal Reserve might soon end its interest rate-hiking cycle.

Spot gold was up 0.4% at $1,999.88 per ounce, and has risen about 1% so far this week. U.S. gold futures gained 0.4% to $2,001.20.

The dollar index has been deteriorating due to the weaker data coming out this week which should shift the Fed to a more dovish pivot and then that could be a tailwind for gold in 2024, said Phillip Streible, chief market strategist at Blue Line Futures, in Chicago.

The dollar index fell 0.3% and was on track for a second weekly drop on growing expectations the Fed could start cutting interest rates next year.

"After all, the latest economic data have been rather disappointing," Commerzbank said in a note.

Commerzbank expects the first rate cut to be implemented in the middle of next year, so only then is the price of gold likely to climb lastingly above $2,000.

Traders widely expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged in December, while pricing in about a 50% chance of a cut as early as May, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.

"We don't see either a significant move higher or lower in the short run into next year and it becomes more certain that the U.S. central bank is willing to cut interest rates and probably cut interest rates significantly before we reach the 2% inflation target," said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategies at TD Securities.

Lower interest rates diminish the opportunity cost of holding non-interest-bearing gold.

Spot silver gained 2.4% to $24.23 per ounce. Platinum rose 1.4% to $927.98, heading for its second weekly gain. Palladium was up 1.9% at $1,065.59 per ounce. </textarea>
