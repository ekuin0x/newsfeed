We all want to be playing the best golf balls for our game, whether an elite player, mid-handicapper, or just starting out, but how do you find out which is the right model with so much information out there? You turn to a robot.

Our first robot golf balls test was one of the most popular pieces of content we have ever produced – and we’ve been trying to do one again ever since.

The pandemic, plus the scarcity of golf robots (and most of those are owned by brands that make balls) has made it a huge challenge to pull off. But we’ve done it, thanks to Loughborough University, and Ping.

Loughborough has a world-renowned reputation for sports research. That’s the reason Ping established their state-of-the-art Performance Centre there, with the aim of advancing cutting-edge technology and innovation in the world of golf.

Let’s now get back to discussing the 2023 robot golf balls test!

Ping have done masses of ball testing with their own robots at their Arizona HQ, and when they heard we were keen to set up our own test, they introduced us to Dr Jonathan Roberts, Senior Lecturer at Loughborough’s Sports Technology Institute.

Fast forward four months and it’s done; our second robot balls test is here and it is a super useful package of content for any golfer. So, whether you’re a hard-swinging low handicapper or a slow-swinging senior, this robot test will identify the best ball for your game.

Robot golf balls test: Meet the robot

We ran a robot golf ball test back in 2019, at PXG in Arizona, and it was one of the most popular equipment tests we’ve ever done, gaining millions of views across our website, YouTube and the magazine.

Since that success, we’ve been keen to do it again, but first Covid and then PXG’s own ball launch (we’ll only use a robot without any links to a ball manufacturer) meant we had to find another venue – and expensive golf robots don’t grow on trees!

There are just three in the UK; one at the R&A’s equipment test facility at Kingsbarns GC, and two at the Sports Technology Institute at Loughborough University, the leading sports science university in the world. Loughborough have a close relationship with Ping – it’s the home of the brand’s new Performance Research Centre, and Ping introduced us to the right people to ask: “Can we borrow your robot, please?”

Once they understood what we wanted to achieve, Loughborough said they could help. And thanks to their indoor test lab, we could create a controlled test environment without the interference of weather, which is a huge concern when hitting thousands of shots down a range over five days. It also meant we could easily retrieve any ball that presented abnormal flight behaviors and slice it open to see if there were any deficiencies in its construction.

No ordinary robot

Loughborough’s main research robot is the Miyamae Shot V (they also have an older ex-Dunlop Slazenger model that produces a repeatable, but much cruder swing). The Miyamae was made in Japan and cost $100,000 almost 20 years ago when the university bought it. Unlike the Golf Labs robot we used last time, which is pretty much standard in most major golf R&D labs, the Miyamae works on three axes so it can be set up to better replicate any swing.

Dr Jonathan Roberts, Senior Lecturer at the Sports Technology Institute, was keen to see whether a robot could better replicate golfers’ swings, rather than simply swinging a golf club consistently and repetitively like engineers usually need when comparing clubs. The Miyamae set-up, with some tinkering from his team, is a robot that has three independently controllable axes. It allows the tailoring of club delivery to match/mimic any golfer on the planet.

Robot V swings around a central hub, like the chest of a person, which allows cocking of the wrists and rotation around the shaft axis to replicate how your hands rotate and square the face coming into impact. All three axes can be controlled independently, and Dr Roberts is working with Ping to get the robot to replicate specific swings for a new analysis system.

Setting up the golf robot

With so much adjustability, it takes time to set the robot up to deliver the club in exactly the way you want, and additional time to check the machine is consistently hitting the defined parameters. Obviously for us, to best replicate how human golfers launch shots, we wanted balls to be hit with a neutral path, and neither up nor down onto the ball for driver shots.

For irons and wedges, a typical attack is down onto the back of the ball, all characteristics we dialed in through the robot’s set-up. Though the robot can hit a couple of shots per minute once set up, getting that set-up right can take an hour or more, particularly when switching from drivers to irons, or irons to wedges.

At Loughborough, Dr Roberts has worked on the biomechanical analysis of golfers, using motion capture, for the past four years. It’s next-generation stuff and it’s for a new analysis system Ping are creating to give a better understanding of how different swings are more suited to different types of equipment. This data was used to program the robot for our test, so real swing characteristics have influenced how every shot has been hit.

Dr Roberts told us: “The transition at the top of the backswing feels important, but most R&D robots start swinging from parallel to the ground (so not in the usual address position) and have a pause at the top of the backswing. Our robot can recreate how somebody loads the shaft in a certain way, we get a natural transition from backswing to downswing, and we can look at how the shaft deforms and so on.”

He’s since spent time working with adidas in Germany and TaylorMade in Basingstoke and is just coming to the

end of a PHD where he’s focused on working with the ECB (England and Wales Cricket Board) on head injury prevention.

Robot golf balls test 2023: How we did it

Experience tells us the only true way to accurately reveal any difference between golf ball performance is via a repeatable swing and a consistently accurate impact location, something no human tester can ever reproduce. The likes of Rory McIlroy might get close, but we wanted to test 28 different balls across different swing speeds and with different clubs; so a robot was our only option.

When we did a similar test in 2019, we used the robot at PXG’s R&D facility in Arizona; this time, the robot was a bit closer to home at Loughborough University, one of the world’s leading sports research facilities.

Why different clubs and different speeds?

We’re all about the club golfer here at TG, so it was really important for us to test each golf ball at different swing speeds to reveal how each ball will perform for you. That means no matter what your swing speed, you’ll find plenty of useful information within this test tailored to your own game.

Our driver shots were hit at speeds of 85, 100, and 115mph (moderate, mid, and fast); for irons, we used a mid-80mph speed, with wedges coming in at 74mph.

To ensure our results are relevant to real-world golfers, we also used Ping clubs suited to these speeds; a 9° Ping G430 LST driver (with X flex Tour 2.0 Chrome shaft) at 115mph; a 10.5° Ping G430 Max driver (with S flex Tour 2.0 Chrome shaft) at 100mph; and a 10.5° Ping G430 Max (with R flex Alta CB Black) at 85mph – read our Ping G430 drivers review.

We took the same approach for irons and wedges using the Ping i230 7-iron and pitching wedge (with S flex Dynamic Gold 105 shafts).

Why we used Loughborough’s golf robot

With the cost of buying an R&D golf robot running to $100,000-plus, there are not too many around. And the brands that have them also make balls, which obviously presents a conflict of interest should we use one to perform a golf ball test against competitor balls.

Loughborough University, though, is often referred to as the best sports science university in the world, and when Ping (who have also invested in an R&D lab on campus) mentioned the Uni has a robot on the site, we enquired about gaining access.

It’s taken months to set up, but with Senior Lecturer Jonathan Roberts being a golfer and understanding our cause, and Loughborough being an hour’s drive from our UK office, the partnership made perfect sense.

How we picked the golf balls

Time on an R&D robot is costly. Every hour taken up hitting balls for our test means the machine can’t be used for other research. The robot also needs a qualified operator, to ensure the set-up is correct and test conditions don’t change, and people like that are not easy to find, either. With time on the robot being limited, we had to select the balls most relevant to most people, as testing every single ball on the market simply wasn’t an option.

In order to test a good range of balls, from the most popular tour golf balls to lower-compression club golfer balls and the best budget balls, we drew up a shortlist of 28 models. We knew from our previous robot ball test (which featured 22 models) that this number could just about be tested within a single day from one of the five different situations (three driver speeds, one 7-iron speed, and one pitching wedge speed). That meant the whole test could be wrapped up in five days.

Our first big decision was to eliminate the direct-to-consumer golf balls that have sprung up over the last decade to get the list down to 28. There aren’t too many factories capable of producing golf balls that aren’t owned by the likes of Titleist, Srixon, Callaway or TaylorMade, so a lot of these DTC models are quite similar in terms of R&D, and most barely create a blip on the radar in terms of global ball sales. We will, however, be doing a thorough DTC balls test over the summer.

After that, we needed to include the leading tour balls from the game’s biggest brands (including PXG), along with the popular ‘club golfer’ balls (including Kirkland) and a number of value-for-money options (like Maxfli). Every decision we made was geared to giving you the best, most relevant information to help you establish which ball best suits your game, and pocket.

Why we tested indoors

It wasn’t too long ago the golf industry thought outdoor testing and fitting was the only way to go, as it gave the opportunity to see a shot’s entire flight. Since Foresight and their camera-based launch monitors have arrived on the scene, though, thinking has changed.

Foresight’s GCQuad is now recognized by players and brands as one of the best golf launch monitors, and it now features in many R&D test labs. And because it measures everything you need to know about a golf shot within 18 inches of the ball leaving the clubface, the Quad makes it possible to accurately test indoors.

The added benefit of testing indoors is that it’s possible to create a controlled lab environment, so weather conditions – temperatures, wind, or rain – have no effect on the data, which isn’t the case when testing outdoors. All the data came from a Foresight GCQuad for our last robot test in 2019, so it made sense to use the same system.

Each ball was hit only once

We wanted to create the cleanest, most accurate data possible, so we only hit each golf ball once.

Our thinking means that if there’s ever a ‘rogue’ ball among our samples, it only affects one of the five situations we test from, not all of them. It also means if any ball is damaged during the hitting process, it doesn’t get reused, so it can’t skew our data on subsequent shots.

We asked brands to send us five dozen of each ball selected for testing, which allowed 12 shots to be hit from each of the three driver swing speeds, as well as a dozen of each ball with the 7-iron and pitching wedge.

In total, that’s 1,680 robot shots during the week. Each of the five individual test orders was randomized and split into sets of three balls at a time. That ensured there wasn’t a four to five-hour gap between testing the first dozen and the final dozen, just in case there were any temperature swings inside the lab.

Thousands of pieces of data

By tracking head and ball data through the launch monitor, we created thousands of data points (looking just at basic ball and club data, there are 19 different metrics for every shot!), which gave us a mountain of data to analyze.

It took the best part of two weeks to sift through it, checking, double checking, and coming up with averages for the longest, fastest, and spinniest balls, and deciding on our recommendations within each product category.

Robot golf balls test: How do golf balls differ?

Two-piece golf balls

Two-piece balls are the least expensive. Typically they have a big core under a thick ionomer or surlyn cover. For many club golfers two-piece models represent an excellent blend of reasonable performance and value, particularly if they’re prone to losing a few.

Even though these are the least expensive balls on the market, it’s not uncommon to find a choice of a softer feel, longer distance, or a blend of both in a single ball. We’ll highlight the difference between this category and others so you can weigh up if it’s really worth paying for tour-level performance or urethane-cover club golfer balls.

Balls tested Category Callaway Supersoft Under £30 Srixon AD333 Under £30 Wilson Duo Soft Under £30 Pinnacle Rush Under £30 Bridgestone E6 Contact Under £30

Three-piece golf balls

More than half the balls in this test are three-piece, which means this is a very popular construction method for tour and club golfer balls. The core size is shrunk to allow a mantle layer to sit between the core and outer cover, which allows engineers to dial in different characteristics based on the wants of the target player.

Tour-level three-piece balls have urethane covers to maximize wedge spin and greenside control. Gone are the days when three-piece tour balls were just softer, higher spinning versions of firmer four-piece ‘X’ style balls; today, Srixon and Bridgestone only make three-piece tour balls. So, each model is dialed up or down to a swing speed the ball is aimed at, and/or the feel, distance, and wedge spin that particular golfer is likely to desire.

Four-piece golf balls

Traditionally, four-piece golf balls were firmer ‘X’ style, lower spin, higher flying models; but things have changed.

The most recent Pro V1x (four-piece) is said to have higher long-game spin than the Pro V1 (three-piece) and a higher ball flight. Callaway’s Chrome Soft X and X LS are both four-piece, with the X being more workable, and the X LS generating lower long-game spin.

Common thinking is firmer balls are faster and longer, irrespective of swing speed. We’ve also seen they don’t always spin lower with a wedge than their softer siblings. Use our test data to identify the models that are fast and long with the driver/iron and spin with a wedge.

Balls tested Category Titleist Pro V1x Premium tour level Callaway Chrome Soft X Premium tour level Callaway Chrome Soft X LS Premium tour level Wilson Staff Model Premium tour level Maxfli Tour X Club golfer (urethane cover)

Five-piece golf balls

TaylorMade are the only major brand to make five-piece balls, and the TP5 and TP5x are played by Rory McIlroy, Collin Morikawa, Dustin Johnson, Brooke Henderson, Tommy Fleetwood, and Rickie Fowler.

With three layers between the core and cover, the brand have more knobs and levers to tweak to dial down driver spin, up launch or maximize wedge spin. The firmer feeling TP5x is faster, longer and launches higher, whereas the TP5 offers a little extra wedge spin and shot-shaping potential.

Robot golf balls test data and verdict – Bridgestone Tour B X

Driver 85mph Swing Bridgestone Tour B X Ball speed (mph) / Launch angle (º) 123.3 / 13 Backspin (rpm) 2,895 Carry (yards) 191.1 Driver 100mph Swing Ball speed (mph) / Launch angle (º) 145.1 / 12.1 Backspin (rpm) 2,686 Carry (yards) 240.8 Driver 115mph Swing Ball speed (mph) / Launch angle (º) 166.8 / 10.8 Backspin (rpm) 2,108 Carry (yards) 293.8 7-Iron Ball speed (mph) / Launch angle (º) 106 / 21.2 Backspin (rpm) 5,702 Height (feet) 87.5 Descent angle (º) 46.3 Carry (yards) 146.7 Wedge Backspin (rpm) 7,679 Shot area (sq yds) 5.7 Carry (yards) 105.3 Average Shot Area Averaged over driver, 7-iron and PW 30.4yds sq

Robot golf balls test verdict: With the Tour B X being designed for swing speeds above 105mph it’s unfair to analyse performance at 85mph and 100mph with the driver. We’ve seen from our research into Ping’s Ballnamic golf ball database how the Tour B X comes highly recommended, but our test data shows the ball floating around average for lots of metrics.

At 115mph with the driver, it tied for sixth longest (three yards back from the Maxfli Tour X) with a shot area 26% greater than our test average. 7-iron backspin was above average (260rpm), carry was a fraction short, but shot area was 34% tighter than average.

With decent wedge spin (504rpm less than our highest spinning ball), and a shot area half that of our test average, it feels like the Tour B X is a good bet for high-speed golfers who are happy to dial in additional accuracy rather than going all out after more power.

Robot golf balls test data and verdict – Bridgestone Tour B XS

Driver 85mph Swing Bridgestone Tour B XS Ball speed (mph) / Launch angle (º) 123.4 / 13.1 Backspin (rpm) 2,901 Carry (yards) 191.3 Driver 100mph Swing Ball speed (mph) / Launch angle (º) 144.6 / 12.2 Backspin (rpm) 2,731 Carry (yards) 239.6 Driver 115mph Swing Ball speed (mph) / Launch angle (º) 165.7 / 10.8 Backspin (rpm) 2,147 Carry (yards) 291.1 7-Iron Ball speed (mph) / Launch angle (º) 106 / 21.3 Backspin (rpm) 5,713 Height (feet) 87.9 Descent angle (º) 46.4 Carry (yards) 146.6 Wedge Backspin (rpm) 7,790 Shot area (sq yds) 8.6 Carry (yards) 105.7 Average shot area Averaged over driver, 7-iron and PW 26.2yds sq

Robot golf balls test verdict: Bridgestone say the Tour B XS ups spin over the Tour B X. Our data supports their thinking, but we’re talking very small amounts. An additional 39rpm backspin compared to the Tour B X with driver (at 115mph) means giving up 2.7 yards of carry.

With a 7-iron the backspin difference drops to 11rpm (with just 0.1 yards carry distance between the two), and 111rpm with a PW, so club golfers are likely to struggle to see any real difference between the pair. Interestingly, both balls were inside our test average for shot area, with the higher spinning Tour B XS, which racked up the smallest area at our 115mph driver speed, boasting 26.2yds sq compared to the Tour B X at 30.4.

Robot golf balls test verdict: We applaud Bridgestone for making tour-optimized balls for golfers swinging driver at less than 105mph, but there’s absolutely no covering up our data doesn’t show either the RX or the RXS ripping up any trees.

Compared to Callaway’s ERC Soft (which has a hybrid cover, not a pure urethane cover) which targets a similar golfer, the RX is eight yards back when averaged across the two driver speeds (85 and 100mph) it was designed for, and a 7-iron.

Throw in wedge backspin performance that’s 911rpm down on the ERC Soft and a shot area that’s 16.5% bigger than its rival and you can see where we’d spend our cash.

Robot golf balls test verdict: It’s really tough analyzing data from 28 different balls, hence why we break things down and look at different constructions, accuracy, and cost per yard. In each category, we highlight the three top performers, so when we come to analyze our findings we can easily spot models that excel in different areas. Balls highlighted as top performers within two or three of our categories then get serious attention, so understand where their strengths really lie.

The RXS didn’t appear among any of our top-performing models in any situation, but it bubbled around the test averages throughout all sessions and, for a higher spin ball, produced surprisingly low levels of wedge spin. For this cost, we reckon there are better-performing models out there, even if you are after a slightly higher-spinning golf ball.

Five two-piece models took part in this test and if we said the Bridgestone E6 ranks fourth for combined driver and iron distance (averaged over the 85mph and 100mph speeds), fifth for wedge spin, and third for overall accuracy, you, like us, will probably be thinking that there are slightly better-performing options out there, even at this end of the market.

6 Callaway Chrome Soft golf ball Among the longest balls for 85mph driver swings £4.17 per ball / 0.21p per yard (based on RRP) Price: £38.95 View Offer When the Chrome Soft first launched in 2014 the ball was made from four pieces. Today it has switched to a three-piece construction.

Low driver and iron spin, along with high launch, mean the Chrome Soft is a very straight and accurate ball, but full wedge shot spin and greenside control are lower than the tour preferred Chrome Soft X.

The Chrome Soft has become a very interesting ball in the Callaway line-up as it’s full of the brand’s tour tech but pitched at club golfers, which isn’t too dissimilar to the more affordable ERC Soft.

Comparing the two, the Chrome Soft averages at 5.2 yards shorter across the three driver speeds and 7-iron, and spins a fraction more with the iron (218rpm, but is still 478rpm less than our test average), whereas the ERC Soft boasts 678rpm more wedge spin and a 34.9% tighter shot area. But with £6 per dozen difference in cost, we can see why so many golfers opt for the ERC Soft.

Robot golf balls test verdict: The X fills massive shoes as Callaway’s most-played tour ball. And we’ve seen from Ping’s Ballnamic software how the model stacks up admirably across the board. Our results support Ping’s findings.

The ball ranked among our three fastest across all three driver speeds. It produced 465rpm more 7-iron spin and 390rpm more wedge spin than our test averages. And when we throw in a 10.3% tighter shot area than the test average, you quickly see you have a top-performing tour-level ball on your hands if you opt for the X.

If you’re stuck between the X and X LS, the lower spinning LS cut driver spin at 115mph by 77rpm, which rose to 571rpm with a 7-iron and 559rpm with a wedge, so make sure you have enough speed to stop it quickly on the dancefloor.

8 Callaway Chrome Soft X LS golf ball Among the top three for 115mph driver swing carry distance £4.17 per ball / 0.21p per yard (based on RRP) Rrp: £40.95 Price: £34.89 View Offer The best modern players have a tendency to hit shots pretty straight, with them falling out of the air on one side of the target line or the other. It means the days of aggressively shaping shots are numbered. If your swing speed is fast, and you love hitting high, straight bombs off the tee, the Chrome Soft X LS has your name stamped all over it.

For the extra speed and distance, you’ll need to accept a slightly firmer feel and trade off a little wedges spin on both full shots and greenside. ... read less Specs Construction Four-piece Cover Urethane Dimples 332 <meta charset "utf-8">Compression Feel Medium Flight Higher Colors White; Yellow Alternative models 360º Triple Track; Triple Track; Tru Track; Truvis

Robot golf balls test verdict: Callaway reckon the X LS is brilliant for hitting long, straight bombs, and our data at least half supports that claim. At 115mph it was the third longest driver ball, and just 132rpm away from being our lowest spinning model.

However, when we look at accuracy, it was above average for shot area from the situations it was designed to be used within (so, not the 85mph and 100mph speeds).

If cutting spin is your priority, of the four four-piece tour balls on the test, the X LS span least with driver at 100 and 115mph, and with the 7-iron and wedge.

With the premium-priced Chrome Soft filling their ‘urethane club golfer ball’ space, the ERC Soft fits into the family by offering different alignment technologies in Callaway’s lowest spinning and straightest ball.

Robot golf balls test verdict: This is a cheeky offering that irks some brands, as they believe its hybrid cover is different from the models it’s most often put up against. However, the ERC is a three-piece golf ball and it’s aimed at club golfers like you.

A fourth, first, and second longest performance at 85mph/100mph driver speeds and 7-iron respectively says everything you need to know about the ball’s distance credentials.

Just be aware the model is low spin, which means giving up around 200rpm at 85-100mph with a driver, and 696rpm/326rpm with a 7-iron and wedge, versus our test averages.

The model was our lowest iron spin ball within the three-piece club golfer category, but it wasn’t our lowest spinning wedge ball, but if offers a decent blend of both distance and wedge control.

Impressively the ERC was our most accurate 7-iron ball with an impossibly tiny 2.7yds sq, which helped it beat our test average from all five situations by 9%. But, if accuracy is your number one requirement the Wilson Triad (which targets a similar golfer) gave a tighter dispersion by 11.2yds sq.

Driver 85mph Swing Callaway Supersoft Ball speed (mph) / Launch angle (º) 122.4 / 14.1 Backspin (rpm) 2,280 Carry (yards) 195 Driver 100mph Swing Ball speed (mph) / Launch angle (º) 142.8 / 12.7 Backspin (rpm) 2,284 Carry (yards) 241.4 Driver 115mph Swing Ball speed (mph) / Launch angle (º) 162.7 / 11.5 Backspin (rpm) 1,910 Carry (yards) 287.8 7-Iron Ball speed (mph) / Launch angle (º) 105.8 / 22.4 Backspin (rpm) 4,792 Height (feet) 91.4 Descent angle (º) 46.6 Carry (yards) 149.8 Wedge Backspin (rpm) 7,129 Shot area (sq yds) 14.8 Carry (yards) 106.1 Average shot area Averaged over driver, 7-iron, and PW 37yds sq

Robot golf balls test verdict: Based on this performance and the price we can see why the Supersoft has proved such a big hit. Our lowest spin ball at the 85mph and 115mph driver speeds, and it just missed out on the same crown in the 100mph category. Just remember this is a low-spin ball, which isn’t always the best option if you have issues flighting shots high enough to maximize carry distance at lesser speeds.

With the 7-iron it was the third longest, but it produced 650rpm and 448rpm less backspin with the iron and wedge than average, so bear in mind it might not stop quite as quickly as a Wilson Duo Soft or Srixon AD333.

Robot golf balls test verdict: So much has been said about Kirkland Signature balls since Costco entered the market, but this test highlights how the model performs against the very best. Make no mistake, the Kirkland is a very high-spin golf ball, which means the model is either shortest or joint shortest at 85mph/100mph with a driver, and 7-iron, so this model is likely to be less useful for higher-speed players.

However, that same high spin DNA means the model is also our second-highest spinning ball with a 7-iron and fourth-highest spinning with a wedge, traits that could prove useful possibly as an alternative to golfers who play two-piece golf balls. Incredibly with an average of just 21yds sq the Kirkland is also our third most accurate golf ball. These are results we couldn’t have predicted prior to testing.

So, if you’ve tried two-piece balls and found them to be too hard or too low spin, so long as you’re willing to put 7.9 yards of carry distance on the line (averaged across the 85mph and 100mph driver speeds and with a 7-iron) versus the Srixon AD333 (11p per yard), or 12.5 yards versus the Wilson Duo Soft (10p per yard) you can completely out spin them with an iron and wedge, whilst also being more accurate.

Hopefully, that should be food for thought for golfers who usually buy predominantly on budget, and those whose number one focus isn’t just speed and distance.

Robot golf balls test verdict: Balls such as the Maxfli Tour have upset the apple cart for the big brands over the past half-decade. And we can see why. The Tour ranked fifth, second and joint sixth longest across the 85/100/115mph speeds while being bang on average for spin and distance with the 7-iron.

OK, with a wedge it fell 339rpm against our test average, and overall there was a 4.2sq yd bigger shot area. But for significantly less money than a Pro V1, for many players, they won’t be deal breakers. If you can get your hands on some, the Maxflis are well worth trying.

Robot golf balls test verdict: We included the Maxflis in this test as we’d seen how often they cropped up while trawling Ping’s Ballnamic golf ball selector. And based on this evidence we’re glad they didn’t miss out.

At 115mph with the driver, the Tour X produced both our fastest ball speed and longest carries on test (it was also second longest at 100mph and second fastest at 85mph), which is seriously impressive for the price.

Apart from spinning 284rpm more with the 7-iron, and 210rpm with a wedge, the model was bang on our test averages, too.

Compared to the Pro V1x the Tour X is 6.5 yards longer (averaged over 100/115mph driver speed, and 7-iron), but it does though give up a smidge 3.7% of spin with a 7-iron, and 1.6% with a wedge. Our data also has the model down as producing a 12.8yds sq tighter shot area, which is seriously impressive.

Robot golf balls test verdict: Pinnacle fans could easily make a case for the model to be crowned the best two-piece ball tested. Within that category, it produced the third longest distance (averaged over 85/100mph drivers and 7-iron), second highest iron spin, highest wedge spin (which was seventh highest among all the balls tested) and second tightest overall shot area, which is all highly impressive.

Just bear in mind its spin numbers are a fraction low, so if your swing speed is average or below, it won’t make it any easier to launch the Rush high, or get it to stop.

Robot golf balls test verdict: The PXG Xtreme launched with plenty of noise, as the brand’s first entry into the ball market. PXG wanted to simplify the ball buying process, so one ball fits all, and they wanted it to sit somewhere between the Pro V1 and Pro V1x. Our numbers don’t quite support their thinking, but being our highest spinning ball with a wedge, 7-iron and at 100mph driver speed says this model will apply the brakes right alongside the best of them. It might struggle to maximize your full distance potential, though.

Compared to a Pro V1 at three driver speeds and with a 7-iron the Xtreme gave up 6.6 yards, but generated 514rpm more iron spin and 558rpm more wedge stopping power. Throw in a 10-square-yard tighter shot area, and the model goes down as a spinny and accurate ball, that’s not quite the fastest or longest.

The story is pretty similar versus the Pro V1x. Where the Xtreme gives up 3.7 yards of carry distance (with driver at three speeds and a 7-iron) but out-spins the Titleist with a 7-iron and wedge to the tune of 297rpm and 271rpm. Our data also has it being 5.3 sq yards more accurate too.

Robot golf balls test verdict: It’s interesting that Srixon now only make three-piece tour balls, which demonstrates the changes in thinking around balls over the last few years. And a test like this helps you understand the differences between the Z-Star and its siblings.

The Z-Star was pretty much bang on our test averages at 100mph driver, and with a 7-iron (bar spinning 356rpm more with the iron). Generally, its shot area was slightly bigger than average, except with a wedge, where it was our second most accurate ball.

If you’re attracted to the model we’d seriously advise considering the Z-Star Diamond too. The Diamond is fractionally longer with the driver, slightly shorter with the irons, but it spins more with a 7-iron and wedge, and is more accurate – traits lots of reasonable speed club golfers will appreciate.

Robot golf balls test verdict: The XV is Srixon’s most played tour ball, but based on our data we’d seriously recommend looking at the Z-Star Diamond as a slightly more rounded choice.

At 100mph and 115mph driver speeds our numbers show a tiny 2.2 yards of driver carry distance difference between the Z-Star, Z-Star XV and Z-Star Diamond.

With so little difference with a driver, and the Diamond offering more iron and wedge spin, the XV could easily be squeezed to the fringes of any golf ball buying shortlist. However, if you put a premium on hitting big drives with very little shot shape from the tee, then it could be ideal for you.

Robot golf balls test verdict: The new kid on the block at Team Srixon, the Z-Star Diamond turned in some decent numbers across all our test situations. So, if you’re looking at three-piece tour balls such as the Pro V1 and Bridgestone Tour B X, this has to ring your bell.

Within the three-piece tour level category, it was our longest ball at 115mph driver speed. It also racked up most spin with a 7-iron and wedge and was one of only three balls in the entire test to break the 8,000rpm spin barrier with the latter, alongside a 27.6% tighter shot area than our test average. A great option for faster swing speeds.

Robot golf balls test verdict:

Club golfers who don’t produce tour-level swing speeds have been spoilt for choice since brands like Srixon started optimizing urethane cover balls with a slightly softer feel. However, with so many choices it can now be tough to make a decision on which best suits you. But by studying the Q-Star and its competition (Chrome Soft, Tour Response, Triad, and ERC Soft) closely there’s a real story to tell about how golf ball engineers optimize individual models for their intended audience.

The Q-Star Tour isn’t the very longest with a driver or iron. In fact, you’re likely to give up 3.3 yards of carry distance at 100mph with the driver, by playing it. But where spin levels with the ERC Soft, the longest ball in the category, drop 12.8% below the 7-iron test average to gain distance, the Q-Star Tour sticks at a steady level.

In a crowded 28-model golf ball test the Q-Star Tour won’t instantly stand out on a spreadsheet, but those in the know though will appreciate it for doing a decent job across the board, which includes ducking under our test average for shot area.

Robot golf balls test verdict: When we last did a robot golf ball test in 2019, the AD333 walked away with top honors in the under £25/two-piece category. While there were slightly longer balls, the AD333 kept spin levels with iron and wedge high, which helps stop shots efficiently and boost your scoring.

The picture is pretty similar this time, too, albeit you could easily make an argument for choosing the Callaway Supersoft or Wilson Duo Soft instead. The AD333 produced more iron spin than any other two-piece ball, and it was our second-highest spinning with the wedge. On paper, it easily gives the more expensive three-piece Callaway ERC Soft a run for its money.

Robot golf balls test verdict: It would be very easy to glance over our data and spot the TP5 didn’t rack up any top places for being the fastest, longest, most accurate or highest spin. But neither did the best-selling Pro V1… the model the TP5 sets out to attack.

This is a higher-spinning ball, which is demonstrated by only two other balls spinning more at 100 and 115mph with the driver. We saw 8.9% more spin than our test average with a 7-iron, and it was our third-highest spinning ball with a wedge. So, if it’s maximum spin you’re looking for, the TP5 really delivers.

Compared to the Pro V1, the TP5 was 2.7 yards shorter averaged over the 100 and 115mph driver speeds, but it out-spun the Titleist with a 7-iron and wedge. So, if you blindly play the Pro V1 for maximum spin you might want to rethink your golf buying strategy. If additional spin isn’t your number one requirement the TP5x offers up a fraction more distance.

Robot golf balls test verdict: The last time we produced a robot golf ball test the TP5x stood out as a brilliant tour ball that was fast and long with the driver and iron without giving up serious amounts of wedge spin. Not too much has changed. It recorded above-average spin with a 7-iron and wedge, and was longer than our test average at 100 and 115 mph with the driver.

Versus the Titleist Pro V1x, the model the ball was originally designed to challenge, the TP5x created exactly the same driver distance, averaged over our 100 and 115mph speeds. With a 7-iron, the very slightly lower spinning TP5x (204rpm) was a yard longer, whereas with a wedge the Titleist produced 183rpm more spin.

In such a tight call between the pair, it’s worth knowing the TP5x produced a 21.8% tighter shot area.

Robot golf balls test verdict: By racking up carry distances longer than our test averages at 85 mph with a driver, and 7-iron, this ball is a better fit for average-speed players than harder hitters.

There’s no covering up the fact the ball spins 12.5% less than our test average with a 7-iron, but that’s where some of the distance comes from. Interestingly the Tour Response boasts more iron spin than the Callaway ERC Soft, but less wedge spin, so there’s a real decision to be made between the pair.

Though we didn’t measure greenside spin, it would be generally be accepted the Tour Response’s urethane cover would bite into the grooves of a wedge slightly more than the ERC Soft’s hybrid construction.

Compared to the Chrome Soft X, the Pro V1 is both slower and shorter across our 100 and 115mph driver speeds and with a 7-iron. OK, we’re talking small amounts (no more than a yard from any situation), but throw in how the Titleist also spins less with a 7-iron (176rpm) and wedge (342rpm) and gave a larger shot area (by 30.9%), and you realize Titleist’s icon has never had a tougher job to stay on top.

Robot golf balls test verdict: If you’re the type of person who still thinks the firmer Pro V1x is just for faster swing speed players, you’re a bit out of touch. If launching shots higher will help you land approach shots softly and accurately more often, it’s likely the Pro V1x will be the best Titleist golf ball for your game.

Our test highlights how closely the two Pro V1s are matched for distance, and how they get there in slightly different ways. Greenside spin is very similar between the two, but we reckon more decent club golfers would prefer the Pro V1x’s additional iron (217rpm) and wedge spin (287rpm), and the slightly tighter shot area (4.7yds sq).

Robot golf balls test data and verdict – Wilson Staff Model

Robot golf balls test verdict: It could be argued Wilson don’t have too much pedigree when it comes to making top-level tour golf balls, but our results suggest the brand deserve way more credit than they get.

The Staff Model produced either our fastest or second-fastest ball speeds at all three driver speeds and our second-longest carry (295.7 yards) at 115mph. It also placed sixth in terms of wedge spin and impressively was our second most accurate ball overall.

At £3.75 per ball compared to a £4.17 Pro V1, the Wilson boasts some seriously impressive performance. Compared to both Titleist balls our data has the model down as being longer with the driver and iron. It sits between the two Titleists for iron spin, and out-spins both models with a wedge. Throw in how the Staff Model is slightly less expensive and more accurate on shot area and you’ve got a top-performing tour ball for a very reasonable amount of money.

Thanks to a very slightly lighter core Wilson’s urethane club golfer ball has higher MOI to help you hit more fairways.

The Triad helps you hit more greens as a thinner cover dials up iron spin. And ensuring each ball is density balanced (with a centered core) helps you hole more putts.

Robot golf balls test verdict: We really like how Wilson pitch Triad as a ball for club golfers who don’t really want to add an element of extra distance to their game. It’s a statement that our results support. As long as you can live with giving up 2.5 yards against the very longest in the club golfer category, the Triad is a top performer.

Wilson said they dialed up iron spin, and our data highlights how the model spins more than the competition (TaylorMade Tour Response, Callaway Chrome Soft, Callaway ERC Soft, and Srixon Q-Star Tour). It’s also second only to the ERC Soft in terms of wedge spin.

Wilson promised greater accuracy too, which comes from removing weight from the core, but we were stunned then that the Triad came out as our most accurate overall ball (with a shot area of just 17.2 sq yds).

Robot golf balls test verdict: Most golfers buying two-piece balls will never analyze each model’s performance before making a purchase, and that’s fine; it says plenty about the category and the people who buy within it. If you happen to plump for the Duo Soft, either by accident or choice, your game is in safe hands.

Compared to the two-piece competition, it ranks first for shot area, second for distance, third for wedge spin, and fourth for iron spin, so this is a really solid choice. However, we really wanted this test to highlight whether mid-handicap club golfers would be better served by a two-piece ball rather than a more expensive, three-piece urethane option (the Triad). If you’re happy to sacrifice a few yards and a little spin, save some cash and go for the Duo Soft.

Robot golf ball test results: The best performers

Our best tour golf balls

Callaway Chrome Soft X – RRP $39.99 / £50 per dozen

VIEW US OFFER | VIEW UK OFFER

To truly be tour level, a ball needs to be played by the world’s best, which means Maxfli’s strong performing Tour X couldn’t really be factored into this category.

We’ve picked the Chrome Soft X as, at 100 and 115mph with the driver, it was tied third and second for the fastest ball speed, and also only bettered by 0.2 yards of carry (by the Wilson Staff Model) as our longest tour ball. So, if leaving nothing behind off the tee is part of your strategy, the Chrome Soft X has you covered.

What really caught our eye, though, is an impressive blend of iron and wedge spin. Yes, the Pro V1x, TP5, and Z-Star Diamond are slightly higher spinning from both situations, but they’re fractionally shorter too. And when you throw in the Callaway’s tighter shot area than both the Titleists and TaylorMades, we reckon you’ve got yourself a winning model.

If your game puts more of a premium on iron and wedge spin, Srixon’s Z-Star Diamond is 1.4 yards shorter from the tee but offers 152rpm and 110rpm more iron and wedge spin respectively. And if you’re looking to slash your ball budget by using a Maxfli, the Tour X is a fraction longer but spins slightly less.

Wilson Staff Model – RRP $49.99 / £44.99 per dozen

Wilson have come out of this test smelling of roses as not only are they keeping up with the big boys in terms of ball speed, spin and distance, but two of their models are also among our three most accurate balls.

It’s seriously impressive for a brand who aren’t currently renowned for making tour balls. In fact, if the Staff Model was a bit more widely played on tour it would be worthy of a shout for top honors in this category.

As far as ball speed goes, the Staff Model tied first at 100mph and second at 115mph, which meant it was our longest tour-level driver and iron ball.

Iron and wedge spin levels are very similar to a Pro V1x (and higher than a Pro V1), which is obviously a very good benchmark to hit. But the icing on the cake has to be an RRP that’s lower than the competition, and a tighter shot area.

Pound for pound, of the balls actually played on tour, this is the best-performing tour-level ball you can get your hands on – and you can currently pick it up for far less than the RRP.

TaylorMade TP5x – RRP $49.99 / £49.99 per dozen

VIEW US OFFER | VIEW UK OFFER

Cast an eye over our data and you’ll see the TaylorMade TP5x is very closely matched to the Srixon Z-Star Diamond, so we understand some players will feel the Srixon could be a better option.

However, our thinking goes along the lines that if you’ve got the clubhead speed, you’re likely to appreciate a fraction more distance with your woods and irons, rather than exchanging that yardage for a fraction more iron and wedge spin (spin naturally comes from more speed anyway).

The TaylorMade TP5x numbers also look very similar to the Pro V1x on our spreadsheets, so either ball would be a fantastic choice. We’ve plumped for the TP5x as it has a fractionally smaller shot area when averaged over all five test situations, but if you went for the Pro V1x, we’d understand why.

On tour, the TP5x is played by the majority of TaylorMade athletes and it’s easy to see exactly why. Those players, male and female, all have speed, so naturally create a lot of spin. Unless they’re targeting a slightly lower ball flight, most gravitate towards the slightly longer and lower spin TP5x (we’re talking 200-300rpm less iron and wedge spin).

Callaway ERC Soft – RRP $39.99 / £44 per dozen

VIEW US OFFER | VIEW UK OFFER

Club golfers are spoilt for choice when it comes to performance three-piece balls nowadays, which is incredible considering this category wasn’t a thing a little over five years ago. By racking up first and fourth longest at the 85 and 100mph driver speeds (the speeds the ERC was designed for), and ranking second for 7-iron distance – all without giving away tons of valuable control – we think the ERC deserves the full attention of club golfers in 2023.

Of the three-piece balls that specifically target club golfers (TaylorMade Tour Response, Wilson Staff Triad, Srixon Q-Star Tour, and Callaway Chrome Soft), the ERC Soft produced the least amount of iron spin (12.8% lower than our test average), but the most wedge spin, which at first read set a few alarm bells ringing. But thanks to a higher shot height and steeper descent angle than our test averages, we reckon the ERC can work well for all but very moderate-swing-speed players.

If we were spending our own money, we’d look for Callaway’s new 360 Fade alignment version, which gives a belt-and-braces approach to performance and maximum alignment help on the dancefloor.

Wilson Staff Triad – RRP $29.99 / £39 per dozen

VIEW US OFFER | VIEW UK OFFER

After decades of testing, we’re well aware the claims made by brands don’t always stack up in terms of test data. When they do, however, we have to take our hat off and applaud those that deliver on their promise. The Triad is one of those products.

Just like Wilson say, it will be a better fit for golfers who are already happy with how far they hit the ball, even though it was never more than 0.3 yards short of our test averages with driver or 7-iron. Where the Triad shines, though, is in delivering more iron spin than its competitors and just 102rpm less than the significantly more expensive Titleist Pro V1; a performance it reverses with the wedge, where the Pro V1 spins a fraction less.

But where the Triad truly excels is in its accuracy. That’s exactly what Wilson promised when they removed a tiny amount of mass from the core to boost MOI, and our data shows the theory works in practice. Across the board, the Triad was considerably and consistently inside our shot area averages (second place at 100mph driver speed), which gave an overall ranking as our most accurate ball across all five test situations.

A brilliant choice for reasonable speed club golfers who could benefit from doubling down on accuracy and consistency over adding more distance to their game.

Srixon Q-Star Tour – RRP $34.99 / £36.99 per dozen

VIEW US OFFER | VIEW UK OFFER

So many golf balls over recent years have dined out on lowering spin to add distance, which is great as long as you have enough swing speed to launch shots high enough to maximize carry distance. Golfers who don’t have that speed need more spin to keep the ball in the air for longer, which makes the game more playable with higher shot heights and steeper landing angles. So, while on paper the Q-Star Tour might not stand out as a headline grabber, as it isn’t the fastest or longest, the reality is that at more reasonable swing speeds (hovering 5mph either side an average of 92mph with a driver), this ball is a very solid choice.

We’re fans of how spin doesn’t duck below 5,000rpm with a 7-iron, which is different from the Callaway ERC Soft, TaylorMade Tour Response, and Callaway Chrome Soft. Yes, the Tour is 679rpm behind our test average for full-shot wedge spin, but shots fly higher and descend at a steeper rate, so stopping power isn’t unduly compromised.

Our data also shows the Q-Star Tour to be incredibly accurate with 7-iron and wedge (8.8 and 5.3yds² respectively versus test averages of 9.4 and 12.3yds²), a trait reasonable speed club golfers will really appreciate over the course of a season. So it’s a cracking golf ball for club golfers – exactly the audience Srixon intended to target.

Srixon AD333 – RRP $29.99 / £27 per dozen

VIEW US OFFER | VIEW UK OFFER

Golf has become a launch monitor game, and it’s easy to simply identify the longest or fastest equipment when buying golf balls, drivers or irons. But to ensure you play equipment that helps rather than hinders your entire game, you really need to look for across-the-board performance to ensure you can play and score out on the course. Because being longest off the tee simply isn’t enough reason to warrant a purchase.

The popular AD333 was a top performer in our 2019 robot test, and we’d heartily recommend it again if you’re spending less than £30 on a dozen balls.

It’s neither the fastest nor the longest with a driver or iron. In fact, in the two-piece category, you’ll likely give up 1.9 yards with a driver and 2.9 yards with a 7-iron against the very longest. But the AD333 comes into its own with irons and wedges. Within the two-piece category, this was our highest spinning 7-iron model (5,243rpm) and second highest spinning wedge ball, which at 7,711rpm is higher than a Titleist Pro V1.

Factor in a higher-than-average shot height and steeper descent angle and you quickly build a picture

of the AD333 being very playable on the course.

It isn’t the cheapest ball in the category, but our data suggests at swing speeds hovering around average (92mph with a driver) or below, this would be a better choice than the lower-spinning Wilson Duo Soft or Callaway Supersoft.

Wilson Duo Soft – RRP $22.99 / £25 per dozen

VIEW US OFFER | VIEW UK OFFER

Based on where you want to put emphasis in your own game, it could easily be argued that four of the five balls within our two-piece category deserve top honors.

If you have an average or above swing speed (92mph+ with the driver), the Duo Soft is likely to be a preferable option, as you don’t need the additional spin and shot height appreciated by more moderate-speed players who’ll benefit from playing Srixon’s AD333.

At 100 mph with the driver, the Duo Soft span 13.4% less than our test average, and 6.8% less than the Srixon AD333 (it also span 12.9% less than the test average with 7-iron), which adds distance as long as you have enough speed to launch shots high enough to maximize carry.

Within the two-piece category, the Duo Soft was also our third highest spinning wedge ball and most accurate model, with a shot area 14.7% smaller than average. If £25 for a dozen balls is your limit, your game’s in safe hands with the Duo Soft.

Pinnacle Rush – RRP $25 / £20.99 per 15 balls

VIEW US OFFER | VIEW UK OFFER

With Pinnacle’s reputation for being rock-hard distance balls, we were astonished to see the results the Rush produced with a pitching wedge. At 7,925rpm – 4.6% above our test average – the model was the highest spin two-piece wedge ball, and it outspan models such as the Pro V1 and Pro V1x. Before you get too carried away with numbers, we’d recommend trying the joint least expensive ball on test (tied with the Kirkland Signature at 7p per yard) from the greenside to gauge feel and control, as neither formed part of this test.

If you like the feel from short range, then our data suggests that thanks to the Pinnacle being longest within the two-piece category (242.6 yards at 100mph), but a couple of yards back from the longest at 85mph with a driver, this ball is likely to give the best results for average and above swing speed players. If, however, you’re just looking for the cheapest balls you can get your hands on and your swing speed is below average (92mph with a driver), in exchange for three/four yards with the driver/7-iron, the three-piece urethane cover Kirkland Signature+ spins more than the Rush (with irons and wedges), and gives more control greenside.
