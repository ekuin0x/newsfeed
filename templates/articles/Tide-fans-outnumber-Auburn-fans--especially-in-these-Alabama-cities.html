                <textarea id="text" readonly> For every ten Auburn football fans across the state of Alabama, there are about 23 Alabama Crimson Tide fans cheering a little louder.

That’s according to new research from the Center for Sports Analytics at Samford University, which analyzed data from social media accounts from marketing firm Zoomph about the popularity of the Iron Bowl’s competitors and the state’s two largest universities.

Darin White, executive director of the Center for Sports Analytics at Samford, said it’s one way to measure who will likely be tuning in for this weekend’s Iron Bowl as the two teams face off.

“The data seems to indicate that Alabama is stronger and stronger the further you go away from the center of the state,” White said, pointing to the concentration of Alabama fans in Huntsville and Mobile. “That’s kind of fascinating.”

Alabama fans outnumber Auburn fans in 13 of the state’s 20 largest cities. The greatest gap held by Crimson Tide fans is, naturally, concentrated around Bryant-Denny Stadium, in Tuscaloosa – with about 29 Alabama fans for every Auburn fan. Next up is its northern neighbor, Northport, with about 17 Alabama fans for every Auburn fan.

Near the home base of the Auburn Tigers, there are about 22 Auburn fans per one Alabama fan in the city of Auburn and almost 10 Auburn fans per one Alabama in Opelika.

Despite stories of families and neighbors with split allegiances and warring team colors, a smaller group of cities report an even split. Just five cities – Prattville, Vestavia Hills, Dothan, Montgomery and Phenix City – had a roughly equal Alabama and Auburn fan ratio.

It may come as a surprise that, despite all the build up to the Iron Bowl, most people in Alabama do not follow either team. According to the data, across the state, just 38% of residents follow either Alabama football, Auburn football, or both.

Of course, it’s unsurprisingly much higher in the areas that house the football giants, like Tuscaloosa’s 67% and Northport’s 75%, as well as Auburn’s 73% and Opelika’s 67%.

But some of Alabama’s other major and fast-growing cities track more closely to the state’s rate, such as Birmingham, Mobile and Daphne.
