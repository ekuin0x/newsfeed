What is Black Friday?

Black Friday refers to the Friday after Thanksgiving, and it's typically one of the biggest shopping holidays of the entire year. Positioned just before the holiday season, this event is the perfect time to score major discounts on everything on your shopping list, from air fryers and electronics to fashion, furniture and more.

When is Black Friday 2023?

Black Friday falls on Friday, November 24, and Cyber Monday is Monday, November 27. We expect retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Wayfair to host Black Friday sales with the year's lowest prices on big-ticket — including options that we've tested firsthand at the GH Institute.

While Black Friday used to exclusively describe the Friday after Thanksgiving, that looks a lot different nowadays. Thanks to online shopping, Black Friday has become synonymous with the entire month of November (and even before). That said, the very best deals are still typically reserved for this weekend after Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday.

Why is it called Black Friday?

According to Encyclopedia Britannica, the term originated among Philadelphia police officers in the early 1960s. They used "Black Friday" to describe the day after Thanksgiving when droves of suburban tourists flocked to the city to begin their holiday shopping. The huge crowds created a headache for the police, who worked longer shifts than usual as they dealt with traffic jams, accidents, shoplifting and other issues.

Later on in the 1980s, the phrase then began to take hold among retail merchants who were operating at a financial loss, or "in the red," until the post-Thanksgiving boost in sales turned a profit, or put them "in the black." Black Friday described the day stores began to gain a profit for the year in what would become the biggest shopping day in the United States.

Do you get better deals on Black Friday or Cyber Monday?

"When Black Friday was an in-store event, the deals were completely different from the online deals offered on Cyber Monday," says Senior Commerce Editor Heath Owens. "Nowadays, most brands combine the two holidays into one big sale that lasts the whole weekend after Thanksgiving — with a few exceptions."

He adds: "Large retailers like Amazon and Walmart will have special 24-hour deals designated to just Black Friday or Cyber Monday, but those products are typically still on sale for the rest of the weekend at a slightly smaller discount. Also, some direct-to-consumer brands will offer an increased discount on Cyber Monday to lean in to the holiday's online roots."

Owens continues: "That said, we expect the vast majority of this year's sales to last through the weekend, so you can plan to shop at your convenience and still feel confident you're getting a great deal."
