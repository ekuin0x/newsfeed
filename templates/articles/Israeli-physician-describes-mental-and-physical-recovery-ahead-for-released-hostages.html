                <textarea id="text" readonly> Nick Schifrin:

Seven weeks of captivity, seven weeks of worry for the families of some hostages is now over. Today, Hamas released 13 Israelis and 11 Thai and Filipino workers kidnapped in the October 7 terrorist attack.

In exchange, seven weeks of war in Gaza is now on pause. Israel silenced the guns and allowed more humanitarian aid to reach Gaza. The hostages range from 4 to 85 years old. And, tonight, they are receiving medical care surrounded by their families.

Tonight, the sounds of freedom, horns and rousing cheers. The first Red Cross trucks carrying released hostages arrived at the Rafah Crossing in Egypt, women and children loaded into buses that crossed into Israel to be reunited with their families after 49 days of the captivity.

Among the released, 85-year-old Yafa Ader, mother to three, great-grandmother to seven. On October the 7th, she was abducted from kibbutz Nir Oz and paraded through Gaza City. Her oldest grandson is still a hostage. Also released, the Monder family, 78-year-old Ruthi, 58-year-old Keren, and 9-year-old Ohad.

The Asher family, seen here being kidnapped, mother Doron and daughters 4-year-old Raz and 2-year-old Raz Aviv, and Danielle Aloni and her 5-year-old daughter, Emilia.

There are so many released children, the hospitals receiving them are trying to create an atmosphere that feels like home. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the release and said it was just the beginning. </textarea>
