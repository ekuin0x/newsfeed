                <textarea id="text" readonly> A document that previously leaked online shows Manchester United's transfer targets in the summer of 2004.

United went into the transfer window having missed out on the Premiership title to Arsenal's Invincibles, although they did win the FA Cup, and Sir Alex Ferguson was eager to strengthen his squad further.

As reported by Sportbible, the document shows that Ferguson has identified five players that he wanted to bring to Old Trafford.

He succeeded in signing three of them - defender Gabriel Heinze from PSG, a young Gerard Pique from Barcelona and forward Alan Smith from Leeds.

However, United weren't able to secure deals for defenders Philippe Mexes from Auxerre and Vincent Kompany from Anderlecht.

France international Mexes went on to sign for Roma in 2004 before heading to AC Milan.

Kompany, meanwhile, remained at Anderlecht until 2006 and then joined Hamburg prior to signing for United's rivals Manchester City, where he became a legend and enjoyed much success.

Heinze made 83 appearances for United before leaving for Real Madrid in 2007, while Pique played just 23 times but went on to become a superstar at Barcelona. Smith stayed at United until 2007 but suffered a serious injury against Liverpool in 2006 as he dislocated his ankle.

Wayne Rooney wasn't on the list of initial targets but he joined from Everton at the end of August 2004 in what proved to be an inspired move, with the striker proceeding to become the club's all-time leading scorer with 253 goals.

Perhaps partly owing to missing out on Kompany and Mexes, United failed to win the league title in the 2004-05 campaign as they finished in third place.

United were able to bring in another of their targets in Alan Smith, who joined from Leeds

Ferguson's side weren't able to sign Philippe Mexes, who headed to Roma instead
