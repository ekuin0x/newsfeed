Open Extended Reactions

Manchester City striker Erling Haaland has become the fastest player in Premier League history to reach 50 goals, beating Andrew Cole's previous record of 65 games.

Haaland opened the scoring in the 27th minute of City's Premier League game against Liverpool on Saturday to hit the milestone in his 48th game, scoring left-footed after an assist from Nathan Ak√©.

It was Haaland's 18th goal in 20 appearances in all competitions this season.

The 23-year-old tops a star-studded list of strikers, with Alan Shearer (66), Ruud van Nistelrooy (68), Fernando Torres and Mohamed Salah (72) all behind Haaland when it comes to being fastest to 50.

It is a target Haaland had looked likely to reach for a while given his prowess in front of goal. His 36 goals last season, his first in the Premier League, is a record for a single campaign.

The Norway international hit the ground running for City after joining from Borussia Dortmund in 2022, establishing himself as a key figure in the side that won the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup last year to claim the famous treble.

Haaland will now be chasing down Shearer in getting to 100 goals. The Premier League all-time top scorer took 124 games to reach his century.

The match against Liverpool ended in a 1-1 draw after Trent Alexander-Arnold scored a second-half equaliser. </textarea>
