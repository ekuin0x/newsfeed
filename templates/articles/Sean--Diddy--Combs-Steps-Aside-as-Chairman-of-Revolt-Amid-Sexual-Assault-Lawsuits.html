                <textarea id="text" readonly> In the wake of three lawsuits alleging sexual assault, Sean “Diddy” Combs has temporarily stepped aside as chairman of Revolt, the music-oriented television network he co-founded in 2013. Representatives for Combs confirmed the news to Variety.

A statement posted to Revolt’s Instagram page reads, in part: “Sean Combs has stepped down from his position as chairman of Revolt. While Mr. Combs has previously had no operational or day-to-day role in the business, this decision helps to ensure that Revolt remains steadfastly focused on our mission to create meaningful content for the culture and amplify the voices of all Black people throughout this country and the African diaspora.”

Earlier this month, R&B singer Cassie accused Combs of raping and beating her over the course of a decade. Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, previously recorded for Combs’ Bad Boy record label. Just one day after the suit was filed, Ventura and Combs reached a settlement.

“I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control. I want to thank my family, fans and lawyers for their unwavering support,” Ventura said in a statement at the time.

Combs added: “We have decided to resolve this matter amicably. I wish Cassie and her family all the best.”

Combs maintains his innocence, as his attorney Ben Brafman said in a follow-up statement, “Just so we’re clear, a decision to settle a lawsuit, especially in 2023, is in no way an admission of wrongdoing. Mr. Combs’ decision to settle the lawsuit does not in any way undermine his flat-out denial of the claims. He is happy they got to a mutual settlement and wishes Ms. Ventura the best.”

Combs was hit with another lawsuit last week, filed under the New York Adult Survivors Act by Joi Dickerson-Neal, who alleged that Combs “drugged, sexually assaulted and abused” her and that she was the victim of “revenge porn” created and distributed by the rapper. The suit also names Combs’ companies Bad Boy Entertainment and and Combs Enterprises as defendants.

According to the complaint, Dickerson-Neal and Combs met while she was a student at Syracuse University in 1991 and she agreed to attend a dinner with him after appearing in one of his music videos. Dickerson-Neal alleges that Combs “intentionally drugged” her during the dinner, sexually assaulted her, recorded it on video and shared the tape with others. Dickerson-Neal is suing Combs for “substantial and lifetime injuries” that she says resulted from the alleged assault, including “severe depression and suicide ideation.” Per the complaint, Dickerson-Neal is demanding a trial by jury and compensation for alleged “mental and emotional injury, distress, pain and suffering and injury to her reputation.”

A spokesperson for Combs told Variety: “These are fabricated claims falsely alleging misconduct from over 30 years ago and filed at the last minute. This is nothing but a money grab. Because of Mr. Combs’ fame and success, he is an easy target for anonymous accusers who lie without conscience or consequence for financial benefit. The New York Legislature surely did not intend or expect the Adult Survivors Act to be exploited by scammers. The public should be skeptical and not rush to accept these bogus allegations.”

An additional lawsuit filed against Combs by a Jane Doe alleges that the hip-hop mogul and R&B singer Aaron Hall took turns raping her and her friends at Hall’s apartment sometime between 1990 and 1991. A representative for Combs blasted the lawsuit as “fabricated claims.”

Combs started Revolt in 2013 with Andy Schuon and formed a distribution pact with Comcast Corporation. CEO Detavio Samuels told Variety last year that Revolt’s mission is to “shift the narrative for Black people globally, and the way to do that is to build the world’s largest, most powerful Black storytelling platform, powered by creatives.” The network is behind shows including “Love & Respect With Killer Mike,” “Revolt Black News” and “Sneakin’ in With Druski.”

TMZ first reported the news of Combs’ stepping aside as Revolt chairman. </textarea>
