                <textarea id="text" readonly> For the second time in two seasons, former Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Frank Reich has been fired as a head coach.

Reich was let go by the Indianapolis Colts after a 3-5-1 start in 2022. Now the Carolina Panthers are dismissing him after a 1-10 start in his first season of a four-year contract.

Once upon a time, Reich was heralded for being the mastermind behind the Eagles’ Super Bowl LII victory while Doug Pederson was made out to be a dunce. As someone who never subscribed to that obvious nonsense, I’d just like to point out that Reich has been fired in back-to-back seasons while Pederson is on his way to leading his team to back-to-back division championships.

To be fair, Reich’s demise in Indy and Carolina wasn’t entirely his fault. Poor ownership/front office decisions contributed to his lack of success. Of course, he willingly signed up to work for Jim Irsay and then David Tepper. And it’s hard to say the Panthers were looking like a well-coached team this season.

But, whatever, we don’t need to dive deep into evaluating Reich’s head coaching abilities. The question here worth asking for the Eagles is ... does it make sense to hire Reich as an offensive assistant?

It’s not hard to imagine Nick Sirianni having interest in that possibility. The Eagles’ head coach has often outspokenly revered Reich as a key mentor. And it’s fair to wonder if Eagles offensive coordinator Brian Johnson — who has done a better job than most will credit him for — could benefit from Reich’s perspective.

There’s some precedent for such a move. Last year around this time, the Eagles added former Colts offensive coordinator Marcus Brady to their coaching staff after he was fired in-season ... by Reich!

Perhaps you’re running the risk of “too many cooks in the kitchen” but adding Reich as a consultant seems like a reasonable idea. </textarea>
