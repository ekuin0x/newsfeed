                <textarea id="text" readonly> UPDATE November 27 6:11 am ET: The 75" TCL 6-Series deal at Walmart is sold out, but the other two great 75" Cyber Monday TV deals are still available.

The Walmart 75" TV deals for Cyber Monday are amazing. Seriously, this is maybe the best time ever to get a nice, new, gigantic TV on sale. The door-buster Cyber Monday deal is on the 75" TCL 6-Series for $698, which is a full $700 off its retail price, but there are other Walmart Cyber Monday deals on big TVs, too.

What's even cooler is these are new deals. These aren't leftover from Black Friday, these are all-new Cyber Monday TV deals. The TCL 6-Series, in my opinion, is the best Cyber Monday TV deal of them all, but the Sony Bravia might just be the best gaming TV deal of Cyber Monday.

Best 75" Cyber Monday TV Deals

Vizio 75" P-Series QLED TV 33% off $1,198.00 7 $798.00 See on Walmart

75" Sony Bravia XR X90K 4K Full Array Google TV 40% off $1,498.00 17 $898.00 See on Walmart

SOLD OUT 75" 6-Series Roku TV This deal is now out of stock 50% off $1,398.00 9 $698.00 See on Walmart

As far as the TCL 6-Series, it's probably the best entry-level TV on sale at Walmart right now. I mean, $698? That's just bonkers. It's a QLED TV with two HDMI 2.1 ports, so you can use it for PS5 and Xbox games that support 120Hz. It also has 144Hz VRR support, although it's probably not the best 144Hz experience you can have. Still... dude, $698? Who even care, that's such a huge TV for so little money with so many amazing features for gaming.

The Sony TV and the Vizio also have incredible support for PlayStation 5 and Xbox features, as well as PC gaming, if you decide you need at 75" TV for PC gaming. Both have 120Hz support, both have excellent pictures, and both of them are on sale for really great savings. I don't know if you can really go wrong with any of these sets. It all comes down to personal preference and budget at this point.

Walmart's full Cyber Monday deals are now live, with the early access deals initially being open only to Walmart+ members. However, Amazon Cyber Monday kicked off earlier and Best Buy Cyber Monday has also been in full effect. So far, most of the Black Friday deals have rolled over into Cyber Monday, but the Walmart TV deals above are new for Cyber Monday.
