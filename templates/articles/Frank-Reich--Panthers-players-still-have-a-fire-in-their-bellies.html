                <textarea id="text" readonly> The Carolina Panthers are still hungry, even the day after Thanksgiving.

Head coach Frank Reich spoke with reporters this afternoon, just two days ahead of his team’s Week 12 matchup against the Tennessee Titans. He was asked, especially while sitting on just one win, if his players still have a fire in their bellies.

“There’s no doubt,” Reich replied. “The resolve is there, the determination, the fire in the belly—all those things. I mean, this is a highly-motivated locker room group.

“It’s been a tough year so far, but there’s still a lot of football left. We understand that comes one week at a time. We understand we’re goin’ up against a tough, physical team. So, we need to come out there and compete. We have to compete hard on every play, execute at a high level. Very motivated to get things going in the right direction.”

If they’re to get going in the right direction, they’ll have to do it on the road in the Music City. While not the most contentious group in the league at 3-7, Vrabel’s Titans still operate with an established, hard-nosed identity.

Unfortunately for Reich and the 1-9 Panthers, they’re seemingly still trying to figure themselves out.
