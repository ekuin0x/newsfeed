                <textarea id="text" readonly> PHILADELPHIA - Ideally, the Buffalo Bills would love to win their remaining six games because if they somehow pulled that off, there’s almost zero chance that they would fail to qualify for the postseason. That might even be good enough to win the AFC East.

However, running the table is also highly unlikely when you look at who they have to play, starting Sunday in Philadelphia against the team with the NFL’s best record, the 9-1 Eagles.

After their bye next week, the Bills travel to Kansas City, host Dallas, travel to Los Angles to play the Chargers, come home for New England, then finish at Miami.

It’s probably going to be asking a lot for the Bills to win four of those games, and if that ultimately happens, losing to the Eagles would not be a crusher for their playoff chances because this is an NFC opponent and would not affect Buffalo’s already shaky AFC record.

Still, every game matters, and the Bills, coming off a big win over the Jets last week, need to start stacking wins and this would be a good time to start.

This story will be updated throughout the day.

Final score: Philadelphia Eagles 37, Buffalo Bills 34

Jalen Hurts ran for 8 yards to start the Eagles' possession. Hurts completed to D'Andre Swift for 4 yards for a first down. Two plays later, Hurts found DeVonta Smith for 17 yards and on the ensuing play he scrambled for 7 yards to the Bills' 39. On second-and-3, A.J. Brown dropped a short pass. Smith made a grab for 11 yards for a first down to the Bills' 28. Swift followed it by bouncing a run outside for a 16-yard run. Hurts took a designed run 12 yards for the game-winning touchdown.

Bills 34, Eagles 31: Tyler Bass makes field goal to start overtime

Buffalo won the coin toss in overtime. James Cook ran for 1 yard and Josh Allen's pas for Stefon Diggs was incomplete on a play it appeared he was held by Darius Slay. On third-and-9, Allen threw a fastball over the middle for Gabe Davis for 13 yards. Three plays later, the Bills faced another third-and-9 and Allen scrambled for 15 yards to the Eagles' 45. Two plays later, Allen was shoved and added some acting as he was hit by Nicholas Morrow, who was called for roughing the passer.

On third-and-6, Gabe Davis got separation but there was miscommunication with Josh Allen and the ball fell incomplete in the end zone on a play that could've won the game. Tyler Bass made a 40-yard field goal.

Bills 31, Eagles 31: Jake Elliott makes game-tying 59-yard field goal

Philadelphia had a shot at a game-tying or game-winning drive. Jalen Hurts opened with a 9-yard completion to A.J. Brown and picked up a first down with a 4-yard pass to Kenneth Gainwell. Hurts found A.J. Brown for 11 yards and Gainwell for 6 more to get into Bills territory. An 11-yard pass from Hurts to DeVonta Smith put the ball into field goal range at the Bills' 34 but the Eagles were hampered by penalties. Center Jason Kelce committed a false start, Hurts nearly fumbled but the call was reversed to an incompletion, Hurts ran up the middle for 3 yards and Kelce was called for his second false start. On third-and-17, Hurts threw incomplete for Brown. Eagles kicker Jake Elliott drilled a 59-yard field goal.

Bills 31, Eagles 28: Josh Allen touchdown to Gabe Davis gives Buffalo the lead

Buffalo pounded the ball on the ground. The Bills called five straight runs with James Cook and Latavius Murray, pounding the ball 40 yards to the Eagles' 33. Cook had back-to-back 11-yard runs before Murray went for 12 yards, 7 yards and no gain. On third-and-3, Allen completed to Murray for 6 yards and a first down. Allen connected with Stefon Diggs for 14 yards to the Eagles' 13 for another first down. Ty Johnson kept churning for 4 yards on the final play before the two-minute warning. On third-and-4, Allen fired a 7-yard touchdown to Gabe Davis in the middle of the end zone.

Eagles go three-and-out - 7:06 4th quarter

D'Andre Swift ran for 1 yard, Jalen Hurts scrambled for 2 yards and Hurts threw incomplete on a deep pass for DeVonta Smith. Braden Mann punted 48 yards and Khalil Shakir returned it 9 yards to the Bills' 26.

Josh Allen sacked on third down, Bills punt - 8:50 4th quarter

The Eagles' defensive line got to Josh Allen. Allen started with an 18-yard completion to Gabe Davis, but James Cook lost 4 yards on an inside run and Allen threw incomplete for Stefon Diggs. On third-and-14, Philadelphia pushed the pocket and Allen was sacked by defensive end Brandon Graham for a 7-yard loss. Sam Martin punted 54 yards and it was returned 18 yards by Britain Covey to the Eagles' 32.

Eagles 28, Bills 24: Jalen Hurts throws absurd touchdown to Olamide Zaccheaus

Jalen Hurts went full Josh Allen. On third-and-15, Hurts escaped pressure, ran toward the left sideline, planted his feet and heaved a 29-yard touchdown pass to Olamide Zaccheaus, who made a leaping grab as he was pushed on his back by safety Jordan Poyer.

Josh Allen intercepted by James Bradberry - 12:46 4th quarter

Josh Allen was picked off. Cornerback James Bradberry stepped in front of Allen's pass intended for Stefon Diggs for Allen's first big mistake of the game. Bradberry returned the interception 5 yards to the Bills' 24.

Bills 24, Eagles 21: Jalen Hurts throws touchdown to DeVonta Smith

The Eagles answered. Jalen Hurts completed a deep ball to DeVonta Smith for 33 yards to get into Bills' territory. Hurts scrambled for 12 yards on third-and-4 to reach the Bills' 20. On second down, Hurts threw a beautiful ball to Smith, who made a great catch for a 15-yard touchdown. Back to you, Josh Allen.

Bills 24, Eagles 14: Josh Allen responds with second rushing touchdown

Josh Allen is playing out of his mind. Allen led the Bills on a nine-play, 70-yard touchdown drive to push the Bills' lead back to two scores. Allen scrambled for 7 yards on third-and-4 to keep the possession alive and followed with a 29-yard completion to James Cook. Ty Johnson was dropped for a 5-yard loss to set up third-and-11 from the Eagles' 16. Allen was flushed out of the pocket, pump faked and then juked safety Reed Blankenship, and bulled his way into the end zone for a 16-yard touchdown. Allen has the second-most rushing touchdowns by a quarterback in NFL history with 47, 28 behind Cam Newton.

Bills 17, Eagles 14: Jalen Hurts throws touchdown to A.J. Brown

Philadelphia's offense came back to life. D'Andre Swift took a handoff 36 yards down the left sideline to start the drive. Jalen Hurts converted a third-and-2 with a 14-yard pass to tight end Jack Stoll to the Bills' 4-yard line. Two plays later, Hurts connected with A.J. Brown for a 3-yard touchdown.

Tyler Bass misses second field goal - 10:32 3rd quarter

The Bills came up empty. Buffalo began its possession with a 23-yard pass from Josh Allen to Gabe Davis to get into Eagles territory. Khalil Shakir made a 10-yard catch to get to the Eagles' 30 but Allen threw three straight incompletions and Tyler Bass' 48-yard field goal attempt was wide right.

Eagles go backward to start second half - 13:29 3rd quarter

Philadelphia didn't fare any better coming out of the locker room. Jalen Hurts was sacked by Tim Settle for a 4-yard loss on the first play of the second half. Hurts followed with an incompletion and completion to Julio Jones for no gain. Braden Mann punted 58 yards to the Bills' 21.

Halftime score: Buffalo Bills 17, Philadelphia Eagles 7

The Bills scored 17 straight points in the second quarter. Josh Allen has completed 19 of 32 passes for 209 yards with a passing touchdown, rushing touchdown and 249 yards of total offense. Jalen Hurts is 4 of 11 for 33 yards with an interception and has a 0.0 passer rating.

Bills 17, Eagles 7: Josh Allen caps wild sequence with touchdown to Stefon Diggs

There was some craziness at the end of the first half and the end result was that the Bills will take a 17-7 lead into halftime.

First, the Bills had a promising drive that reached the Eagles 4-yard-line die when Josh Allen was called for an intentional grounding penalty and Tyler Bass’ 34-yard field goal was partially blocked by Jalen Carter.

The Eagles then gave the ball right back to the Bills when Jalen Hurts fumbled and Greg Rousseau - who is having a monster game - recovered at the Philly 36.

From there, the Bills committed yet another penalty that pushed them into a first-and-20 at the 27, but they overcame that when Allen fired a 13-yard touchdown pass to Stefon Diggs with 12 seconds left in the half to make it 17-7.

Bills take ball right back with another fumble recovery - 1:02 2nd quarter

Buffalo has another chance before halftime. Jalen Hurts and running back Kenneth Gainwell couldn't execute a handoff exchange, the ball hit the ground and was recovered by Greg Rousseau at the Eagles' 36.

Tyler Bass' field goal attempt blocked - 1:24 2nd quarter

That was an unfortunate turn of events for the Bills. An apparent horse collar tackle on Eagles linebacker Haason Reddick against Josh Allen wasn't called and instead Allen was flagged for intentional grounding. That pushed Buffalo back to the Philadelphia 16-yard line, and two plays later Jalen Carter blocked Tyler Bass' 34-yard field goal attempt.

Referees miss horse collar penalty on Haason Reddick

Eagles offense booed off the field - 2:10 2nd quarter

Philadelphia can't do anything on offense. D'Andre Swift ran for 1 yard, Jalen Hurts was dropped for a 1-yard loss by Greg Rousseau, and Hurts threw underneath to A.J. Brown for 5 yards on third and long. Braden Mann punted 53 yards and it was returned 10 yards by Khalil Shakir to the Bills' 33.

Josh Allen completes big play on third down but Bills punt - 4:20 2nd quarter

Buffalo converted a third-and-7 from its 8-yard line. Josh Allen threw a stroke to Khalil Shakir on the left sideline for 31 yards. After the long pass play, James Cook ran for 2 yards and Allen's passes for Dalton Kincaid and Trent Sherfield were incomplete. Sam Martin punted 40 yards to the Eagles' 19.

Eagles' Fletcher Cox injures, limps off field

Philadelphia has lost two defensive tackles to injures over the last three plays. The 12-year veteran was looked at by trainers and limped off the field and into the medical tent. Cox is questionable to return with a groin injury.

Eagles' Jalen Carter injured

Philadelphia rookie Jalen Carter was injured with 6:29 left in the second quarter. Carter was in on a tackle that dropped James Cook for a 3-yard loss to the Bills' 2. After a timeout, Carter, the No. 9 overall pick this year, was able to get to his feet and walk to the sideline, and had his helmet on.

Philadelphia goes three-and-out - 6:45 2nd quarter

The Bills defense put together another stop. On third-and-6, Leonard Floyd and Von Miller forced Jalen Hurts out of the pocket for an incompletion. Braden Mann punted 51 yards and Khalil Shakir's 10-yard return was wiped out by a holding penalty on Buffalo's Baylon Spector.

Buffalo has held Philadelphia to 80 yards of offense.

Bills 10, Eagles 7: Buffalo capitalizes on interception with Josh Allen touchdown run

The Bills defense came up with a huge takeaway as Leonard Floyd deflected a Jalen Hurts pass and Terrel Bernard caught the pop fly at the Eagles 29.

And then after starting the possession with a holding penalty on Connor McGovern, the Bills dug their way out when Josh Allen hit Gabe Davis for 19 yards on third-and-10, and on the next play carried on a QB keeper up the middle for a nine-yard TD.

The Bills, despite all their penalties, now have a 10-7 lead.

Terrel Bernard intercepts Jalen Hurts - 11:08 2nd quarter

Momentum has shifted on the Bills' 20th takeaway of the season. On second-and-10, from the Eagles' 25, linebacker Leonard Floyd got in Hurts' face and deflected a pass high into the air. Linebacker Terrel Bernard brought in for the interception and returned it 2 yards to the Eagles' 29.

Eagles 7, Bills 3: Tyler Bass makes 48-yard field goal

Buffalo answered Philadelphia’s touchdown, but only with a field goal as Tyler Bass made a 48-yard field goal with 11:23 left in the second quarter.

The big play was an 11-yard scramble by Josh Allen on third-and-10 that enabled the field goal to come into play. Allen misfired on a couple throws, and once again, a penalty hurt the Bills as a hold on Dion Dawkins offset an automatic first down hold by the Eagles.

However, on the next play Allen’s run did convert that first down.

Eagles 7, Bills 0: Jalen Hurts scores rushing TD, Bills defense hampered by penalties

The Bills are in meltdown mode and we haven’t even finished the first quarter. James Cook ruined a promising drive when he dropped a sure-fire TD pass from Josh Allen and from there, the Bills began committing penalties at a record pace.

They wound up punting after two false starts, then a personal foul gifted the Eagles 15 yards at the start of their second possession. And then three more penalties helped them drive 73 yards in 10 plays to Jalen Hurts’ one-yard TD plunge on the Eagles patented tush push play.

It’s an inexcusable start for the Bills in a game that’s so important to them.

James Cook drops potential touchdown, Bills punt - 6:37 1st quarter

The Bills offense moved the ball on their second possession. Latavius Murray ran for 7 yards and Ty Johnson picked up a first down with a 5-yard rush. Josh Allen found tight end Dalton Kincaid for 9 yards and Allen converted a fourth-and-1 with a a "tush push." James Cook took a short pass 6 yards and Murray's 3-yard carry gave the Bills their third first down of the drive. On second-and-6 from the Eagles' 30, Cook dropped dropped a pass on a wheel route down the left sideline that looked like it would've been a touchdown. Offensive tackle Spencer Brown an center Mitch Morse each committed a false start to push the Bills back. Josh Allen's third-and-16 pass to Gabe Davis was incomplete. Sam Martin punted 28 yards to the Eagles' 12 but Buffalo's Siran Neal was flagged for a face mask penalty on the coverage.

Bills defense forces Jalen Hurts into three straight thrown away passes

Two prolific offenses have combined for two straight three-and-outs. Jalen Hurts was pressured and forced to throw the ball away on three straight plays on Philadelphia's first possession. Braden Mann punted 59 yards and Khalil Shakir returned it 9 yards to the Bills' 32.

Bills go three-and-out to start game

Buffalo got the ball first and went three-and-out. James Cook ran for 1 yard, Josh Allen completed to Gabe Davis for 7 yards and then Latavius Murray was stopped for no gain on third down. Sam Martin punted 49 yards to the Eagles' 18.

Andy Isabella to get his first shot with Bills; Lane Johnson out for Eagles

The Bills signed wide receiver Deonte Harty as a free agent in the offseason, but he has been hugely ineffective and Sunday, he is inactive against the Eagles.

Andy Isabella was called up from the practice squad Saturday and he will play, most likely handling the kickoff and punt returns while perhaps playing in certain packages on offense.

Also inactive for the Bills are cornerback Dane Jackson and safety Taylor Rapp who were ruled out Friday with injuries. Defensive tackle Poona Ford is once again down, another free agent signing that has gone poorly. And offensive linemen Germain Ifedi and Alec Anderson, as they have been for every game, round out the inactives for Buffalo.

Big news from the Eagles side as star offensive lineman Lane Johnson, who was downgraded to questionable on the injury report Friday, will not play. He joins star tight end Dallas Goedert who also missed last week’s game against the Chiefs. Philadelphia’s backup tight end, Grant Calcaterra, will also miss the game.

Weather will impact Bills vs Eagles

At 1:30, rain began to move into south Philadelphia and though it began as sprinkles, it is expected to get more persistent as leading up to the 4:25 kickoff, and then is forecast to last for much of the game.

Depending on the amount and severity of precipitation, that could be a big advantage. The Eagles are the better running team with running back D’Andre Swift and quarterback Jalen Hurts operating behind one of the best offensive lines in football, and they also have the No. 1 run defense in the NFL as it allows just 76.5 yards per game.

Buffalo’s defense ranks 16th at 110.5 rush yards allowed per game, but more worrisome is the Bills rank tied for 27th in average yards allowed per rush at 4.5.

To be fair, much of their big problems occurred earlier in the year and over the last three games they are allowing just 3.1 per rush which is best in the NFL over that span.

Bills vs. Eagles prediction

Sal Maiorana: Eagles 27, Bills 19

Long before the Bills began sputtering this season, this was never a game that I felt they were going to win. And given the arcs of the two teams through 11 weeks, nothing has caused me to alter my opinion. Yes, the Bills were impressive in blowing out the Jets last week, and that can certainly be the kind of victory that can get a season turned around.

If they were playing almost any other team Sunday, I’d say there was a good chance that they could keep that momentum intact and possibly get on a roll, but the Eagles are a problematic matchup for Buffalo and I don’t see the Bills winning the game, especially on the road.
