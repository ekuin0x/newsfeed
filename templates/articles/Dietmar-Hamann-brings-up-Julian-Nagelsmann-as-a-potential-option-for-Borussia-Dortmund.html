Niclas Füllkrug on competition for places: We will always have a good striker on the pitch by Tushar Bahl

Dietmar Hamann can imagine Julian Nagelsmann as Borussia Dortmund head coach if Edin Terzic is unable to turn things around at the club.

Borussia Dortmund have endured a difficult start to the season, and things reached a new low on Friday as they let a two goal lead slip against Heidenheim to give the newly promoted side their first ever point in the Bundesliga.

The Black and Yellows already find themselves four points behind title rivals Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen. And the pressure is starting to mount on Edin Terzic, even though the 40 year old retains the full support of the BVB bosses.

Dietmar Hamann has now brought Julian Nagelsmann into the mix as a potential option for Borussia Dortmund if they do decide to make a change in the dugout. The former Liverpool and Bayern Munich midfielder believes that this rumour could heat up quickly, especially if BVB’s slide continues in the coming weeks.

“The question Dortmund have to ask themselves: Given the way things are going at the moment, do we have a chance of progressing in the Champions League group? I said a few days ago that the chance was 20%. After yesterday’s game, maybe it has dropped down a bit more,” Hamann told Sky Sport. “That’s why things could get hot very quickly in Dortmund because you don’t know how long Nagelsmann will be on the market.” “From abroad, he has turned down a few offers. And apart from Dortmund, I cannot imagine him at any other club in the Bundesliga. I can imagine this getting relatively hot pretty quickly.”

Nagelsmann has been out of a job since leaving Bayern Munich in March. But the 36 year old is still under contract with the Bavarians until 2026.

Borussia Dortmund have a number of crunch games coming up after the international break. Up next in the Bundesliga for them is a trip to SC Freiburg. They will then make the trip to France to take on Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League. </textarea>
