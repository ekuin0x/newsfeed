                <textarea id="text" readonly> Last week, Japanese authorities were baffled by a rusted metal ball that washed up on Enshu beach. After X-ray scans, they determined that it was hollow and not threatening to the public, but nevertheless the 1.5-metre sphere prompted numerous theories, ranging from UFOs to espionage. As it turns out, though, this particular metal ball was the least of the conspiracy theorists’ worries.

The same week, on February 21, scientists claimed to have discovered a solid, 400-mile-wide iron ball at the centre of Earth, distinct from the one that we’ve known about since Inge Lehmann’s landmark discovery in 1936. In fact, the study, published in Nature Communications, rewrites what we’ve always been told about the structure of our home planet – namely, that it’s made up of four distinct parts, the crust, the mantle, and the inner and outer cores.

The idea that Earth is made up of five layers was first introduced by two seismologists, Miaki Ishii and Adam Dziewonski, in the early 2000s, based on some unusual patterns in seismic waves generated by earthquakes that passed through the inner core. At the time, though, they didn’t have enough data to back up their argument. </textarea>
