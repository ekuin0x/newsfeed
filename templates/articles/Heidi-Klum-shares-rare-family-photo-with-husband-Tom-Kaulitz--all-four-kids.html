Heidi Klum is celebrating her modern family.

The supermodel switched up her usual racy snaps with husband Tom Kaulitz in favor of a rare photo showing the couple cozying up to her four kids.

“L❤️VE,” Klum, 50, captioned the post Sunday.

In the pic, Leni, 19, Henry, 18, Johan, 17, and Lou, 14, turned their heads away from the camera while sitting on a couch in sweats.

Heidi’s eldest daughter, Leni, whom she shares with businessman Flavio Briatore, laid across her mom’s lap and rested her head in her arms.

Kaulitz, 34, who rocked a striped tee and navy trousers, was all smiles while sitting in between her two sons.

Heidi shares her three youngest children with ex-husband Seal, who also adopted Leni in 2009.

The “Kiss From a Rose” singer paid tribute to the up-and-coming model on her 19th birthday in September.

“In NY with the young woman who changed my life for the better 19yrs ago,” he captioned an Instagram post at the time.

“Thank you Leni for making me a better person 🥹🥹🥹,” Seal continued. “Love you, -papa.”

Meanwhile, Heidi has flooded her social media pages with loved-up snaps of herself and Kaulitz.

The musician recently joined her on the set of “Die Bergretter” while she was filming a cameo for the popular German show.

The “America’s Got Talent” judge and the Tokio Hotel rocker were also spotted at the Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix last week, where the blond beauty went topless under a leather jacket.

She was all smiles in a racy selfie with her husband, in which she wore a pair of sky-high stiletto boots, fishnet stockings, high-waisted briefs and a black leather jacket — with nothing underneath.

The couple said “I do” in 2019, less than one year after they started dating.

They tied the knot in a small California ceremony before Heidi walked down the aisle for a second time in front of their family and friends in Capri, Italy, that summer.

Along with Briatore and Seal, Heidi previously dated bodyguard Martin Kirsten and art curator Vito Schnabel before settling down with her rockstar beau. </textarea>
