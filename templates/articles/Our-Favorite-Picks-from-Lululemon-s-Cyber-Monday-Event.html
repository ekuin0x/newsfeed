As experts have told us time and again, Lululemon’s highly coveted workout clothes are worth paying full price for — and most of the time, full price the only option you’ll have. Today’s Cyber Monday sale is the exception with discounts of up to 70 percent, even on in-demand colorways like black and navy. I was given access to these deals ahead of time and have combed through them to find the best discounts, especially on classic items that have been recommended to us by stylish and sporty types over the years. Below you’ll find super-stretchy tights, pretty yet practical sports bras, and marathon-ready running tees and shorts that’ll last for years without losing their shape in the wash. Lululemon’s TikTok-famous fanny pack (that’s excellent for travel or just running around town in) is on sale, as is a terry sweatband that’d make a sweet stocking stuffer. Our absolute favorite pair of men’s gym shorts is just $49 right now, and you’ll also find women’s yoga pants for under $100.

Because a sitewide sale can be overwhelming, I’ve broken down the best deals into categories: women’s bottoms (including shorts as well as tights), women’s bras and tops (from running bras to tanks that can be worn with jeans), women’s outerwear (including a cute cropped puffer for colder months), men’s bottoms (including an unusually sleek pair of joggers), men’s tops (all of them odor-resistant and wrinkle-free), men’s outerwear (look out for a travel-ready trench) and accessories (from hats to gym bags). I’ll be updating this post throughout the day as items go out of stock — and yes, that’s a directive to act quickly if you see something you like in your size.

Women’s bottoms

Lululemon Align™ High-Rise Crop 17” $39 $88 now 56% off $39 These cropped versions of the above Align pants are also on sale in three different capri lengths, all with the same flattering high waistband. $39 at Lululemon Buy

Lululemon Align High-Rise Pant with Pockets 25” From $59 $98 now 40% off From $59 And here’s those same pants again, but with pockets. While some people dislike wearing yoga pants with pockets on the mat, I’ll always keep a pair around for holding my phone when jogging or even just roaming around the house. From $59 at Lululemon Buy

Lululemon Align High-Rise Jogger Full Length $79 $118 now 33% off $79 Whether you’re warming up or lounging about, these decidedly unsloppy joggers are an excellent investment. They have the same high-rise, slightly compressive waistband as Lululemon’s traditional yoga pants, which makes for a flattering fit while allowing freedom of movement. $79 at Lululemon Buy

Lululemon Align High-Rise Short 6” $49 $64 now 23% off $49 If you’re a fan of the dolphin-smooth yoga pants above, it’s definitely worth trying out a pair of Lululemon’s similarly soft bike shorts. They’re lightweight but compressive, minimizing any unwanted jiggling. $49 at Lululemon Buy

Women’s bras and tops

Lululemon Enlite Front-Zip Bra High Support $59 $108 now 45% off $59 A quintessential running bra, the Enlite suits a wide range of cup sizes and is designed for intense workouts. Hefty cross straps at the back mean you can pound the pavement without feeling any bounce. $59 at Lululemon Buy

Lululemon Align Tank Top $29 $68 now 57% off $29 The sweetheart neckline makes this yoga top, which is also made from the same fabric as the Align pants and shorts above, just a little bit special. And a little more fun to put on at 6AM. $29 at Lululemon Buy

Lululemon Ribbed Nulu Asymmetrical Yoga Tank Top $39 $68 now 43% off $39 Similarly street-worthy is this cold-shoulder top with an elegant loop detail on the back. On the mat, the light support makes it best for small-chested (A to B cup) wearers. $39 at Lululemon Buy

Lululemon Classic-Fit Cotton-Blend Tank Top $29 $48 now 40% off $29 On the looser side of things is this chic cotton tank that cinches in at the shoulders to flatter your arms. It’s soft and sweat-wicking, with a cropped length that ensures you’ll never have to tuck. $29 at Lululemon Buy

Lululemon License to Train Classic-Fit T-Shirt $39 $68 now 43% off $39 Slow-drying cotton tees are no good for sweaty workouts, which is why it’s worth investing in one of Lululemon’s slightly stretchy and moisture-wicking ones made from nylon and recycled polyester. $39 at Lululemon Buy

Lululemon Softstreme Perfectly Oversized Cropped Crew From $79 $118 now 33% off From $79 Also seasonally appropriate is this vintage-y crew sweater that’s made from soft and fuzzy fabric. It’s loose enough to be casually thrown on post-workout. From $79 at Lululemon Buy

Men’s bottoms

Lululemon Fast and Free Lined Short 6” $59 $88 now 33% off $59 Or here’s a pair of lined shorts, if those are your preference, with a hidden phone pocket to keep your most valuable possession secure when running or playing sports. $59 at Lululemon Buy

Men’s tops Lululemon Commission Long-Sleeve Shirt $74 $118 now 37% off $74 A collared shirt for sweaty dudes, this button-up is made from stretchy and moisture-wicking no-iron fabric that still looks and feels like cotton. $74 at Lululemon Buy

Lululemon Fundamental Long-Sleeve Shirt $49 $68 now 28% off $49 For the more casually attired, here’s an odor-fighting, bacteria-resistant basic that’s treated with zinc, which means that it won’t need to be washed after every single wear. $49 at Lululemon Buy

Lululemon Pique Oversized-Fit T-Shirt $39 $68 now 43% off $39 Much more workout-friendly than it looks, this boxy tee is also zinc-treated and features hidden gussets that allow for full arm mobility. Ideal for any tennis players inspired by the Andre Agassi big-shirt-tiny-shorts look. $39 at Lululemon Buy

Accessories

Lululemon Women’s Run for It All Hooded Gloves $29 $52 now 44% off $29 As anybody who took part in a turkey trot last week knows, we’ve officially hit running glove season. These convertible mitts are grippy, smartphone friendly, and almost 45 percent off right now. $29 at Lululemon Buy

Lululemon Women’s Baller Hat Soft $29 $38 now 24% off $29 And this water-repellent logo-less cap is very quiet luxury. (No one at the club needs to know it was 60 percent off.) $29 at Lululemon Buy

Lululemon Everywhere Belt Bag Large 2L $39 $48 now 19% off $39 I really like the idea of giving this TikTok-famous fanny pack as a gift. It can be worn at the waist or as a crossbody, and is spacious enough to stash a few snacks alongside the wearer’s phone, keys, and wallet. $39 at Lululemon Buy
