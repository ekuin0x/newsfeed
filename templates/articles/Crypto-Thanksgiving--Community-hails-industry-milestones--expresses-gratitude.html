                <textarea id="text" readonly> As crypto community members celebrated Thanksgiving, many expressed gratitude for the progress made in the digital asset space over the years.

From comparing price points for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) in 2022 to sharing their Thanksgiving conversations about BTC, crypto users exchanged their musings on X (formerly Twitter) for the holiday.

Animoca Brands executive chairman Yat Siu reminded his followers that there is “much to be grateful for.” Siu posted ETH and BTC prices a year ago and compared them with current market prices. The executive also mentioned Web3’s total market capitalization, which has grown to $1.4 trillion.

1 year ago #ETH was 1,135 and #Bitcoin was 16,171 and today eth is 2,065 and BTC is 37,323 & the web3 token market cap has grown to 1.4 trillion. The Open Metaverse has proven to be remarkably resilient.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin firm River shared a list of BTC prices on Thanksgiving for each year since 2018. The company also urged its X followers to be patient with their loved ones. River highlighted that the price might change, but the conversations about BTC may be the same.

Other community members also shared their answers to the question: “How’s crypto doing?” A crypto investor compared the space to a turkey, saying it requires the correct cooking time. The community member also expressed thanks for the opportunity to invest in the technology.

Crypto is doing well, I try to ignore FUD and it’s growing steadily and surely, like a turkey that needs time to cook properly. I’m thankful for the opportunity to invest in this innovative and exciting technology, but I also know that it’s not a get-rich-quick scheme. It’s a… — Ian Jeffreys (@IanJeffreys1) November 23, 2023

While some had exciting conversations, others said nobody mentioned crypto at their Thanksgiving dinners. One community member shared that while they are neither bullish nor bearish on the space, they are “content.”
