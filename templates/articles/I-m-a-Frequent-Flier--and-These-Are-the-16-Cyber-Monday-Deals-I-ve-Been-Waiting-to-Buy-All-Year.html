                <textarea id="text" readonly> As a professional travel writer, I’m usually on the go, no matter the month of the year. But because my family lives locally, I almost never travel during Thanksgiving week — and it’s such a luxury to opt out of those hectic crowds during this time of year and sit around in my jammies eating and, well, shopping Early Cyber Monday sales online.

After all, it’s the perfect opportunity to stock up on all those travel essentials (and nonessentials) that I’ve been dreaming of, whether that means splurging on big-ticket items or scoring unbeatable deals that turn everyday travel hacks into no-brainer impulse buys. And while so many sales can feel downright overwhelming, I’m here to help you curate your list and make the most of Early Cyber Monday weekend. From sleek luggage pieces to genius tech tools and cozy travel wardrobe staples, these are the 16 best Early Cyber Monday deals to shop this season up to 60 percent off.

Herschel Pop Quiz Backpack

Nordstrom

An all-purpose backpack is a must for speeding through airports and hands-free toting around town at your destination. Herschel makes some of the most classic styles, and I love how this one has a timeless silhouette that can be used for any trip or outing. This pack has padded straps, a fleece-lined laptop sleeve for devices up to 15 inches, and a media pocket to secure your tech on the go. Plus, it’s on sale for nearly 25 percent off at Nordstrom Rack.

Nordstrom Cotton and Cashmere Ruana Wrap

Nordstrom Rack

There are so many reasons to travel with a cozy wrap: It’s an extra layer when you need it at your destination, and it doubles as a blanket or cover-up on an airplane (where it’s always freezing). This one is easy to wear with a loose fit and an open front. Plus, it's made with the softest (and coziest) cotton and cashmere blend that you'll want to snuggle up with as soon as you're in your seat.

Ododos Mini Belt Bag

Amazon

On travel days, I love a belt bag because it keeps everything securely close to the body and away from pickpockets. And, it ensures my essentials — phone, passport, credit card — are always at the ready, instead of at the bottom of the bag when I’m in a hurry and there’s inevitably a line forming behind me. This budget-friendly and best-selling unisex version comes in 36 colors so there’s one (or more) for every travel wardrobe. And it's versatile, too. In their review, one shopper shared: “The strap is long enough to wear crossbody and can be easily shortened for a more traditional fanny pack."

Monica Vinader Mini Leather Jewelry Case

Nordstrom

Nothing frustrates me more than traveling with my favorite jewelry only to arrive at my destination to find an irrevocably tangled mess. This cool jewelry case solves that problem, and it’s so tricked-out and smartly designed: The slim oval case zips up for compactness and organization and comes complete with ring, earring, and necklace holders. Plus, its striking turquoise hue and richly-grained leather exterior make it extremely luxe.

Columbia Women's Slope Edge Mid Jacket

Columbia

During Columbia's Early Cyber Monday sale, shoppers can score this top-rated jacket for a whopping 60 percent off. And, you'll be happy that you added this versatile transitional coat to your cart once you zip it up; it's water-resistant, insulated, and all-around comfy, making it the perfect travel companion for any cold-weather trip. Don't miss this chance to upgrade your outerwear collection — I know I won't.

Big Blanket Hideout Hoodie

Big Blanket Co.

This massively oversized hoodie is an absolute dream for holiday travel — or any time of year. Wear it on the plane, cozy up on the couch in your alpine cabin, or just get comfy and warm anywhere with this tricked-out hoodie with shearling lining, a built-in eye mask, zippered kangaroo pouch and cuffed sleeve with thumb holes. It’s sure to be your next go-to, and it's on sale for Early Cyber Monday (add it to your cart to see the savings).

Iseyyox Travel Charging Station

Amazon

Prime members can score a huge 43 percent off this ultra-practical and compact charging station so you can refuel all of your Apple devices at once. The wireless charging pad has magnetic suction, and can charge your iWatch, iPhone, and AirPods at the same time. It’s lightweight and super portable for travel. One five-star reviewer called it “the Swiss Army knife of chargers for Apple lovers” — and even declared it their “new favorite travel charger.”

Caookdk Cable Organizer

Amazon

A cable organizer is essential to keep your tech tools tangle-free and at the ready. This budget-friendly case is waterproof and shockproof, with two compartments and room for tools like power banks, hard drives, cables, headphones, and more. According to an Amazon reviewer, “The compact size of the organizer is perfect for travel; it fits easily into my carry-on or backpack without taking up much space.” They also noted that its durable shell will "ensure that my valuable electronics stay protected throughout my journey.”

Caracilia Sweater Set

Amazon

If it’s a travel day, you’ll always find me in a two-piece lounge set for comfort and easy, effortless style. I’m eyeing this sumptuous oversized set, with a V-neck lantern sleeve top and high-waisted wide-leg pants. One fan raved that it’s “super comfortable” and “very soft,” and you can get it for an affordable $40 for Early Cyber Monday.

Coolife Expandable Spinner Luggage Set

Amazon

If you're in the market for an entirely new luggage wardrobe, this is definitely the right time of year to make the investment. This top-rated Coolife set rings in at nearly 50 percent off, and it includes three hardside, expandable suitcases (small, medium, and large) — so it's just about all the sizes you’ll ever need for carry-on or checked luggage. The set is lightweight and durable, with smooth spinner wheels, aluminum telescoping handles, and TSA locks. This set has close to 5,000 five-star reviews; buyers noted the smooth rolling, tough construction, and value price.

Lo & Sons Catalina Deluxe Weekender Bag

Lo & Sons

The days before Cyber Monday are an excellent time to browse around for new travel bags, especially if you're a Lo & Sons fan. Right now, the brand's ultra-sleek Catalina Deluxe Weekender Bag is 60 percent off, and it's the versatile, bring-everywhere, high-quality duffel that your collection has been missing. Deals this big don't happen often, so don't miss this chance to get it for $86.

Iniu Slim Portable Charger

Amazon

Traveling with a backup charger is absolutely essential, and sometimes I even travel with a backup for my backup — you can never be too prepared when it comes to your tech lifelines. This one conveniently has USB-C ports both inside and outside, and it's just a half-inch thick so it can slip right into your pocket, fanny pack, or carry-on for easy storage and access.

Bagodi Travel Laptop Backpack

Amazon

As a freelance travel writer, I bring my laptop just about everywhere; yes, it’s a little obsessive, but I’d hate to miss even a short window to make progress on a story or handle emails. So a protective carrier is a must, and this one has so many functions beyond just carrying tech safely. It has a large 40-liter capacity and opens all the way, like a suitcase, for easy packing. And it slides right under the airplane seat. “It fits so much more than you'd think; it's very sturdy [and] comfortable to carry and looks great,” one pleased shopper wrote. “I totally recommend this to anyone looking for something to carry as a personal item and avoid paying those high carry-on prices these days.”

Birdies The Phoebe Faux Fur Slippers

Birdies

The Birdies brand is well loved by travelers for its ultra-comfy and packable flats. And in anticipation for Cyber Monday, some of the most fun and festive styles are marked down — which is just in time for holiday travel and parties. The Phoebe in cozy, dressy faux fur is on sale a full 40 percent off, and these slippers can be dressed up for lavish parties or dressed down for comfy lounging at home. (Note: all velvet styles are also marked down up to 30 percent).

M.M.LaFleur The Snyder Jacket: Lush Merino

M.M.LaFleur

I recently traveled with a stylish jardigan (jacket meets cardigan), and it was so easy to pack thanks to its versatility; it feels soft and comfy like a sweater but has a structured and professional look, like a blazer, so it serves many purposes on the road. The waist sash gives a polished, buttoned-up shape to the look (or you can wear it open on the plane for a more casual look and feel).

Etekcity Portable Suitcase Scale

Amazon

Though it's not technically on sale, the Elekcity Portable Suitcase Scale's $11 price tag is basically a deal in itself. This already-affordable gadget has the potential to save travelers tons of money in overweight bag fees — so it’s sure to pay for itself. Just hook it onto your luggage strap to get an accurate reading (note: it has a 110-pound weight maximum). Taking to the review section, an Amazon shopper dubbed it a “traveler’s best friend” and “a game-changer that has made my travel experience significantly less stressful."
