                <textarea id="text" readonly> French actress Zoé Marchal is soaking up the sun in Ibiza, Spain, and she's got the social media updates to prove it. Marchal shared pictures of herself posing in the sand in a black bikini, looking incredibly tan while holding a cold drink in a wine glass. Behind her was the gorgeous ocean, and other happy beachgoers enjoying the sand. "I know I love chocolate too much," she captioned the post. Here's how the daughter of Olivier Marchal lives her best life.

1 Lots of Fruit

Marchal loves snacking on fresh fruit, especially strawberries, which are packed with nutrients and antioxidants. "Strawberries give you a lot of nutritional value for very few calories," says Bailey Flora, MS, RDN, LD. "They're tasty but naturally low in sugar. That's a combination that's hard to beat."

2 Fresh Coconuts

Marchal enjoys fresh coconut, especially at the beach. Coconuts are a great source of potassium and electrolytes. "There are so many different ways to consume coconuts – coconut water, cream, milk, oil and the pure flesh," says Jess Hillard, sports nutritionist from sports nutrition brand Warrior (teamwarrior.com). "Luckily, with so many ways to consume it, it's easy to incorporate more into your diet so you can reap the benefits."

3 She's a Swimmer

Marchal enjoys swimming in the pool when she's on vacation. "Swimming works the heart and lungs," say the experts at Harvard Health. "This trains the body to use oxygen more efficiently, which is generally reflected in declines in the resting heart rate and breathing rate. It uses the arms, the legs, and other muscle groups in between. This improves muscle strength and flexibility."df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec

4 Wine Lover

Marchal's social media shows she is partial to an occasional glass of wine, which should be enjoyed in moderation, experts say. "The truth about having a glass of wine a day is that there's no proven 'good' reason to drink it," says Dr. Joshua Septimus, associate professor of clinical medicine at Houston Methodist. "This doesn't mean you can't drink wine, but a better way to think about enjoying it is to make sure you're minimizing the known negative outcomes of alcohol by only drinking wine in moderation."

5 She Loves Dogs

Marchal loves animals, especially dogs, which science shows is good for your health. "Dogs require regular exercise, and will greet it with smiles and wagging tails," says Tahir Tak, MD, PhD. "In addition to a typical walk, you can work hiking and running into your outings with your dog depending on its breed. People who regularly perform aerobic exercise have improved blood pressure, reduced blood sugar levels, better controlled weight and a reduced risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Other studies have demonstrated that exercise can improve depression and anxiety." </textarea>
