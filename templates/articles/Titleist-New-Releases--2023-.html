                <textarea id="text" readonly> NEW: Vokey Wedgeworks 60 A Grind: The low bounce lob wedge that Wyndham Clark used to win the U.S. Open on the tight and firm conditions at Los Angeles Country Club's North Course in June is now an option in the Vokey Wedgeworks lineup. Featuring a smoother sole with a nearly flat 4-degree bounce angle, the limited edition run came about after Vokey Tour representative Aaron Dill developed the special grind that players like Clark employed in California and was later adopted by Max Homa and Tom Kim at the Open Championship at Royal Liverpool. Featuring much of the technical aspects of the Titleist Vokey Design SM9 wedge line (including the forward and higher center of gravity location and tighter groove milling tolerances), this special club for those with the most precise of wedge games was built with tight lies in mind, Dill said, including input from former U.S. Open champion Australian Geoff Ogilvy, who grew up on the firm conditions of the sand belt courses of his home country. "I spoke with Geoff, and we got on the topic of Australian golf courses and how they compared to courses in America and around the world,” Dill said. “I asked him some specific questions which resulted in an idea to design another lob wedge grind option that complemented the firm links-style conditions. Geoff has always been a low bounce player in his 60-degree, so I took his 60.04L wedge and removed the ribbon, resulting in a grind that moves through the turf quickly with very little resistance.” The WedgeWorks 60 A Grind will be available Nov. 7, in right-hand and Raw Finish (with custom stamping options), $225. </textarea>
