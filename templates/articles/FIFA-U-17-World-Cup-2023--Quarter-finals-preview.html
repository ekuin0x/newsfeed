Spain vs Germany, Friday 24 November 15:30 local time

The first quarter-final features traditional European powerhouses Spain and Germany, with the match taking place on Friday afternoon at the Jakarta International Stadium in the heart of Indonesia’s capital.

While the two nations share five World Cup victories at senior level, neither has managed to triumph in the U-17 tournament with Spain runners-up in 1991, 2003 and 2007, and Germany’s best result a losers medal in 1985.

Both Spain and Germany qualified for the quarters following narrow victories in the Round of 16, with Germany beating the USA 3-2 in their first knockout stage game and Spain overcoming the challenge of Japan with a 2-1 victory.

TSG Hoffenheim striker Max Moerstedt is the most prolific player heading into the upcoming quarter-final, with the German attacker scoring three times so far in the tournament, including a vital strike in their Round of 16 victory over the United States.

Spain’s route to the quarter-finals came courtesy of starring roles from two Barcelona youth players, with Marc Guiu and Quim Junyent providing the goals that saw them through to the final eight.

Brazil vs Argentina, Friday 24 November 19:00 local time

In the second quarter-final, historic South American rivals Brazil and Argentina will battle it out for bragging rights and glory in what may be the most anticipated match so far in the tournament.

In Agustin Ruberto, Argentina boast the highest scorer in the tournament to date, with the River Plate forward netting five times in just four games so far.

However, Brazil are no slouches in front of goal themselves, with Kaua Elias registering four goals to date and Ryan and Estevao scoring three each.

Brazil once again seem to have unearthed one of the stars of the tournament in 16-year-old Estevao, who has been nicknamed ‘Messinho’ after the great Argentine Lionel Messi due to his mesmerising close control and dribbling skills.

He will need to be at his best to overcome the prolific Argentines in their quest for a place in the semi-finals.

Argentina breezed through to the quarter-finals with a 5-0 victory over Venezuela in which Ruberto scored a brace, while Brazil overcame the challenge of another South American side by beating Ecuador 3-1.

This next match may well be a defining moment in both teams’ campaigns, and the confidence gained from beating their fiercest rivals may will give see them installed as favourites for the entire tournament. </textarea>
