                <textarea id="text" readonly> The tie, though, will forever be remembered for Sinner’s comeback triumph in their third brilliant singles duel in less than a fortnight. This time, the Sinner of the Turin group stages re-emerged, the young titan reprising his victory of 12 days ago when he became the only man since Djokovic’s Wimbledon final loss to Carlos Alcaraz to defeat the 24-time grand slam champion. Here he did something even more astonishing when, after soaking up immense pressure throughout the deciding set, he stared at 0-40 on his serve at 4-5. Yet the 22-year-old proved absolutely nerveless, firing down an ace to save the third of the three match points, and then immediately turning the tables by breaking Djokovic in the very next game amid wild Italian celebrations in the stands at the Palacio de deportes Martin Carpena. Sinner then served out for a famous win, ending Djokovic’s cherished unbeaten 21-singles winning streak in the Davis Cup and becoming the first man since 2019 to beat the Serb in singles twice in the same year.

The drama between the two rivals wasn’t over, as the two teams inevitably both drafted in their top singles players into the doubles decider. Sinner was again magnificent and still looking ominously fresh after more than four hours on court, with Djokovic’s weak backhand into the net off the Italian’s second serve in the doubles on match point seeming to sum up his disappointment. The beneficiaries of all this? Lleyton Hewitt’s Australian side, who were happily enjoying a day’s rest at their team hotel further down the Costa del Sol, watching the drama unfold on TV.

While the Italy tie didn’t finish until 8.15pm after a noon start, Alex de Minaur and co should be fresh for combat in Sunday afternoon’s (Monday AEDT) final as they seek to lift the Davis Cup for the first time in 20 years. AAP ‘Biggest win of my career’: De Minaur, Popyrin power Australia into Davis Cup final Lleyton Hewitt has declared his close-knit tennis band of brothers will give it “a hell of a shake” to bring back the Davis Cup to Australia after they roared into another final in Malaga. Following their 2-0 victory over Finland in Friday’s semi-final, executed superbly without a dropped set in singles wins for Alexei Popyrin and Alex de Minaur, team captain Hewitt said he couldn’t be prouder of their achievement in making back-to-back finals.

And even though they’ll be facing either a Serbian side led by world No.1 Novak Djokovic or an Italian team inspired by young superstar Jannik Sinner in Sunday’s (Monday AEDT) final, the inspirational de Minaur was adamant: “No one really wants to play us.” He delivered once more for Australia, taking an 11th victory in his last 13 cup singles matches, sealing Friday’s (Saturday AEDT) win by defeating Emil Ruusuvuori 6-4, 6-3. It had followed a superb win from teammate Popyrin, who defied jangling nerves to earn a 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 victory over Otto Virtanen. It meant the Australians’ crack doubles team of Max Purcell and Matt Ebden weren’t even needed.

But he was happy to pass the laurels to Popyrin, a late squad replacement who’d been asked to take on the troublesome “second singles” role by Hewitt. “Alexei hasn’t played for Australia in a very long time [two years], had a massive match today against a very high-quality opponent and dug super deep,” said de Minaur.

Popyrin managed to deliver a rock solid game, making only 11 unforced errors to his erratic opponent’s 25, to prevail in just under an hour-and-a-half. “It was probably the biggest win of my career,” he admitted. “To win a match that means so much to us, it’s an honour and something I’ll never forget. Nothing compares to this. “I thought I was ready but when I came out and heard the two sets of fans chanting so hard, but it was nerves that I’ve never experienced before.” It wasn’t easy. The pressure was on with Thanasi Kokkinakis, the injured teammate he’d replaced, Purcell and Jordan Thompson having all lost opening singles ties in this year’s competition, and Popyrin struggled too against a big-hitting 22-year-old going for broke.
