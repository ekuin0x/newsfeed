Ranbir Kapoor 's 'Animal' has been running rampage at the box office, in the days leading up to its release. The makers opened up advance ticket bookings over the weekend, giving fans just enough time to book their movie date with the star.According to the latest report on Sacnilk.com, the movie is already on its way to the Rs 10 crore mark. The report claims that the movie has already raked in an estimated Rs 5 crore from three theatre chains - PVR, INOX and Cinepolis - that are running an estimated 2779 shows.The total ticket sales across the national chains have crossed the 128K mark.Reports further state that the movie has already crossed the Rs 2 crore mark in advance bookings in Delhi. Since Day 1, the capital has been leading in advance ticket sales.The film currently has an all-India collection of Rs 8.45 crore.Trade experts have predicted that Animal, which has an 'A' rating, may just go on to record Ranbir Kapoor's highest opening at the box office. If the film continues this upward trend through the week, it could set itself up to record one of the highest openings of the year.The action film takes a deep dive into a violent world as it showcases a troubled relationship between a son (Ranbir) and his father, played by Anil Kapoor .The pan-India film, directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga of "Kabir Singh" fame, also stars Bobby Deol , Rashmika Mandanna and Triptii Dimri.The film will be released theatrically on December 1, in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam.Ranbir was last seen on-screen in the film Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar, opposite Shraddha Kapoor . The romantic flick received a lukewarm response at the box office. </textarea>
