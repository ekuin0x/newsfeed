                <textarea id="text" readonly> Football Australia has reported revenue of AUS$113.3 million (US$74.3 million) for the financial year ending 30th June, a year-over-year (YoY) rise of 48 per cent.

Confirmed:

Broadcast revenue down 26 per cent YoY to AUS$11.4 million (US$7.5 million)

Sponsorship revenue up 47 per cent to AUS$20.2 million (US$13.3 million)

Football Australia’s net surplus was AUS$671,000 (US$440,000) compared with a surplus of AUS$3.6 million (US$2.4 million) for the previous year.

Context:

The revenue increase was driven by the Socceroos’ run to the round of 16 at the 2022 Fifa World Cup, securing AUS$19.4 million (US$12.7 million) in prize money, as well as new sponsorship. Notable deals for Football Australia over the past year included a tie-up with Subway, which saw the fast food chain land naming rights to the men’s national team in a three-year pact reportedly worth almost AUS$12 million (US$7.9 million). Merchandising revenue also leapt from AUS$1.1 million (US$722,000) to AUS$3.2 million (US$2.1 million).

The largest amount of revenue Football Australia has ever generated before the split of the domestic A-Leagues from the national governing body was AUS$132 million (US$86.6 million) in the 2018 financial year.

Football Australia’s latest financial results do not factor in the 2023 Fifa Women’s World Cup, which took place in July and August and saw co-hosts Australia reach the semi-finals. However, the national governing body’s chief executive James Johnson told the Australian Financial Review (AFR) that the sale of Matildas merchandise in Q1 of the new financial year is already worth more than last year’s AUS$3.2 million total. The ratio of Matildas merchandise sales to Socceroos is currently two to one.

Comment:

In Football Australia’s annual review, Johnson said: “The year 2023 has been a watershed for Football Australia and the sport more broadly. It has been a year where the sport has been able to differentiate itself from others within the domestic sporting landscape by highlighting its inherent qualities. We have never been in a stronger position to capitalise on the popularity of the sport, and we have already taken steps to take Australian football to new heights in the future.”

Coming next:

Johnson is confident that sponsorship will continue to rise in the 2024 financial year, with Football Australia to also recognise Women’s World Cup prize money and the tournament’s ticket sales in those final results. The Matildas’ prize money from the World Cup was US$6.3 million, with Fifa paying out from a pot of US$110 million compared with US$440 million for the men’s tournament.

Johnson added to the AFR that discussions with potential broadcast partners about a new commercial deal, which will run from 2025 to 2028, were ongoing and “very competitive”. Football Australia is expecting a deal to be complete by early next year.
