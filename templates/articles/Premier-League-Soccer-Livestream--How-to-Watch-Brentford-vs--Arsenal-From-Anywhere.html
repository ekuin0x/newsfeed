                <textarea id="text" readonly> With just one win from their past five matches away from home, Arsenal will be keen for a much needed victory on the road as they take on London rivals Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium.

The Gunners' last two away days have seen them slip to defeats to West Ham and Newcastle, but their 3-1 win at home to Burnley before the international break means they're still very much in the mix for the English Premier League title.

Brentford fans will be hoping their side have used the break to regroup, after they were comfortably brushed aside 3-0 by Liverpool two weekends ago.

Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch all of the action live wherever you are in the world.

Brentford vs. Arsenal: When and where?



Brentford host Arsenal at the Gtech Community Stadium on Saturday, Nov. 25. Kickoff is set for 5.30 p.m. GMT local time. That's 12.30 p.m. ET or 9.30 a.m. PT in the US and Canada, and 4.30 a.m. AEDT early on Sunday morning in Australia.

How to watch the Brentford vs. Arsenal game online from anywhere using a VPN

If you find yourself unable to view the game locally, you may need a different way to watch -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.

With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier has stuck you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, non-blackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.

Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.

Looking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now.
