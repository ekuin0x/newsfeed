                <textarea id="text" readonly> Philadelphia Eagles veteran Brandon Graham was confident.

The 35-year-old was so confident that when he lost the overtime coin toss to Bills wide receiver Gabe Davis and safety Micah Hyde at midfield, he shot his opponents a line that proved prescient: “It don’t matter,” he said after the Bills told the officials they wanted the ball to start overtime. It was caught on the referee’s microphone for America to hear.

The Eagles won the Sunday overtime thriller 37-34 at Lincoln Financial Field after Buffalo drove down the field but needed to settle for a 40-yard field goal in the extra frame thanks, in part, to Davis running the wrong direction on what could’ve been a touchdown catch.

That three-point lead did not last long as Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts marched Philadelphia back in 3 minutes, 15 seconds. Hurts culminated the nine-play 75-yard drive with a 12-yard touchdown run of his own to clinch the victory.

Hurts finished his Sunday performance with five total touchdowns — two rushing and three passing. He went 18 of 31 passing for 200 yards with an interception. And, most importantly, he helped lead the NFL’s best 10-1 Eagles to another win, their fifth in a row and fifth when trailing at halftime (they were losing 17-7).

Graham, meanwhile, finished with two tackles, including one for a loss, and the only sack of Bills QB Josh Allen.

Plus, he punctuated his franchise-record 189th regular-season game played with the cockiness the rest of his team backed up.
