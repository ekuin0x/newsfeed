SEATTLE — Steve Pool, a beloved weather anchor at KOMO News in Seattle for more than 40 years, has died.

Pool’s wife, Michelle, announced Pool’s death Friday saying Pool died of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Pool was 70 years old, according to KOMO News.

Michelle wrote that her husband fought the disease privately for several years “with every ounce of his being.”

Pool retired from KOMO in 2019 after working at the station for more than 40 years and surviving prostate cancer.

“Please know that he truly loved his job and this community and felt so privileged to be a part of your lives,” Michelle wrote in an Instagram post. “You all were so good to him and thereby good to us. Our hearts are irretrievably broken.”

Pool was a trailblazer. He was among the first African-American weathercasters in the country and became a trusted local TV personality. He was an eight-time Emmy Award winner, author and father to two daughters.

Pool graduated from Tyee High School in SeaTac and the University of Washington.

He began his career at KOMO in 1978 and spent time as a writer, reporter and program producer before becoming the lead weathercaster, according to a biography on KOMO’s website. Pool retired in 2019.

Pool has also volunteered countless hours in the community and served on several boards, including the Museum of Flight and the Boy Scouts of American Rainier Council. </textarea>
