KEY HIGHLIGHTS Herschelle Gibbs names the best young talent.

He ignores Shubman Gill.

According to Gibbs, Rachin Ravindra is the best young talent he has seen for a while.

Indian opener Shubman Gill has been in red-hot form in 2023. This year, he has scored the highest number of runs in ODIs and is the only Indian batter who has managed to score one century at least in three formats of the game and the IPL. In the ongoing ICC Men’s ODI World Cup 2023 as well, during India’s last match against Sri Lanka in Mumbai on November 2, Gill scored 92 runs. Gill has impressed everyone with his batting so far and is seen as the future superstar by many greats and experts of the game.

But South African legendary batter Herschelle Gibbs, who holds the record for hitting six sixes in an ODI World Cup match, has ignored Gill and instead picked a 23-year-old left-handed batter as the best young talent he has seen for a while. The former cricketer is very impressed by New Zealand youngster Rachin Ravindra, who is on song in the World Cup 2023. With 523 runs to his name in eight matches played so far, Ravindra is the second-leading run-getter in the ongoing tournament.

He has scored three centuries and two half-centuries. Rachin reached the triple-figure mark during New Zealand’s matches against England, Australia, and Pakistan. He top-scored by making 108 runs from 94 balls against Pakistan in Benglauru on Saturday (November 4) and helped his side post a total of 401 runs on the board.

When Ravindra was taking Pakistani bowlers to cleaners on Saturday in Bengaluru, Gibbs took to his official X handle to praise the youngster and tweeted, “This ravindra kid from New Zealand looks the real deal... best young talent I’ve seen for a while."

Ravindra opened the innings for New Zealand on Saturday, and by scoring 108 runs, he became the first New Zealand batter to score three centuries in a single edition of the ODI World Cup. He is also the first batter to score three centuries in his maiden ODI World Cup. </textarea>
