                <textarea id="text" readonly> The final Bundesliga matchday before the international break sees Borussia Dortmund face a tough test against VfB Stuttgart away from home.

Borussia Dortmund will hope to end what has been a roller coaster of a week on a high as they take on VfB Stuttgart in the Bundesliga on Saturday. Edin Terzic’s side claimed a 2-0 win over Newcastle United on Tuesday, issuing the right response after their 4-0 defeat to Bayern Munich last weekend.

But the pressure is still on Borussia Dortmund, who have now gone two games without a win in the Bundesliga and find themselves seven points behind league leaders Bayer Leverkusen. The Black and Yellows are likely to be without club captain Emre Can once again on Saturday. We could see a bit of rotation after the gruelling back-to-back games against Bayern and Newcastle.

VfB Stuttgart have made quite the splash in the Bundesliga this season, and find themselves in third place in the standings going into matchday ten. Serhou Guirassy has been the top performer for the Swabians, scoring 15 goals in just nine appearances.

Stuttgart have lost their last two games in the Bundesliga in Guirassy’s absence. Although the striker is now closing in on his return to full fitness and could be in the squad this weekend.

Former Borussia Dortmund youth team player Chris Führich has enjoyed a strong start to the season and will be a player to watch on Saturday. There will also be a reunion with former BVB defender Dan-Axel Zagadou, who has established himself as a key player for Sebastian Hoeneß’ side.

VfB Stuttgart vs Borussia Dortmund: Predicted Lineups

VfB Stuttgart: Nübel – Rouault, Anton, Zagadou, Ito – Karazor, Stiller – Silas, Millot, Führich – Undav

Borussia Dortmund: Kobel – Süle, Hummels, Schlotterbeck, Ryerson – Özcan, Sabitzer, Reus – Brandt, Adeyemi – Füllkrug </textarea>
