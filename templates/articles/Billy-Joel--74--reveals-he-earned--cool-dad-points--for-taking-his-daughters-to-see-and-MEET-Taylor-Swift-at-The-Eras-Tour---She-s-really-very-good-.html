                <textarea id="text" readonly> Billy Joel revealed he earned 'cool dad points' after taking his two daughters to see Taylor Swift during her Eras Tour stop in Florida earlier this year in April.

The Piano Man singer, 74 - who announced he will end his residency at Madison Square Garden in July 2024 - recalled the special night both his children were able to both see and meet the Bad Blood songstress.

The music artist shares daughters Della Rose, eight, and Remy Anne, six, with wife Alexis Roderick - whom he tied the knot with in 2015.

Joel admitted he 'got very cool Dad points' after taking his little ones to Swift's Tampa stop while talking to People at the Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame - which opened an exhibit in his honor on Friday.

The star also gushed about Taylor and her performance, stating, 'Oh, she's great. She's really very good. We're going to probably go see her again.'

Shortly after Billy joined his daughters and wife, Alexis, at the Eras Tour concert, he uploaded a post on Instagram to show images that had captured fun moments.

In one snap that had been taken behind him, the Uptown Girl hitmaker held both of his daughters' hands as he led them through the crowded stadium.

He also shared a photo of his girls dressed up for the big night as well as a selfie that Alexis had taken with Della and Remy ahead of the festivities.

Lastly, Joel included a short reel of his children excitedly dancing to the track, ...Ready For It?, as Swift performed live on stage.

In the caption, the singer had penned, 'Rockin' into our new 'era' thank you @Taylorswift we loved the show! #swifites #taylorswift #theerastour.'

Billy has previously opened up about Taylor Swift and notably compared her to The Beatles during an interview with USA Today in 2021.

He expressed that Swift 'is also a very talented girl and she's productive and keeps coming up with great concepts and songs and she's huge.'

The performer continued, 'You have to give her high marks. She knows music and she knows how to write. She's like that generation's Beatles.'

The Love Story songstress later responded to Joel's comments while talking to Extra not long afterwards.

'That honestly broke my brain,' she admitted to the outlet. 'I don't really know how to process words like that from someone like him.'

The beauty further added, 'I'm a huge fan of his, that's an icon saying that. I don't know if that really happened, I need to see a video.'

And during an interview with the Los Angeles Times earlier this year in March, Joel once again shared his thoughts on the fellow music artist.

The Movin' Out singer said that Taylor is a 'very good, conscientious writer' and added, 'She knows music, and she's productive - she's working her a** off.'

'She gets some shots just because she's so popular, which must be tough to deal with. But I have a great deal of respect for her and for other artists from that same age group.'

Earlier this week on Friday, Billy had the chance to celebrate an exhibition opening up in his honor at the Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame.

The exhibit is called: Billy Joel - My Life, A Piano Man's Journey, and is 'filled with over 50 years of rare memorabilia, videos, awards, recordings, instruments, photos, many donated from Billyâ€™s personal collection,' per the official website.

Saying goodbye: In June, the music artist announced that his longtime residency at Madison Square Garden will officially come to an end next year in July 2024; seen in 2018 in NYC

In June, the music artist announced that his longtime residency at Madison Square Garden will officially come to an end next year in July 2024.

His successful residency at the popular New York venue notably began 10 years earlier in 2014.

When Joel isn't on the stage, he enjoys spending time with his loved ones and daughters. 'I wait around for the kids to come back from school. I love hanging out with my children,' he told the L.A. Times.

The star expressed that Della and Remy are, 'so much fun and so interesting to me. I get to be a stay-at-home dad. That's how I enjoy my life these days.' </textarea>
