                <textarea id="text" readonly> With all the deals going on at the moment it can be tough to manage your spending but a good pair of headphones or earbuds is always a good investment. Weâ€™ve taken the liberty to scour the depths of Amazon for the best headphones and earbuds deals and are presenting them in no particular order. As usual, these offers are limited while supplies last so be warned.

Sony has a few interesting options on sale with the WF-C700N offering good sound quality, potent ANC and a comfortable fit.

If you're after some over-the-ear headphones with great ANC then the WF-1000XM4 are worth looking at. They may be a few years old now but they can still trade blows with the more recent offerings.

The WF-1000XM5 are also on discount and these offer a refined design, improved ANC and longer battery life alongside improvements to voice calls with their new microphones.

There are deals on the AirPods front too. The 2019 Apple AirPods 2 are now available at an all-time low price of $80 in the US. These buds support most of the Apple features you've come to expect like hands-free Siri thanks to the Apple H1 chip. They are lightweight and easy to carry around and fit certain people's ears better than the newer in-ear buds.

If you want more up-to-date features like Personalized Spatial Audio and longer battery life then the 3rd Gen Airpods are a valid option.

You can also take a look at the flagship AirPods Pro 2 which now ship with a USB-C MagSafe charging case. These are Apple's best wireless earbuds and come with active noise cancelation, adaptive transparency and Personalized Spatial Audio thanks to the Apple H2 chip.

Beats Studio Buds are another great option for both iOS and Android users. These in-ear buds offer up to 8 hours of listening time, spatial audio support and active noise cancelation. Being part of the Apple family means you get added benefits for iOS users like easy pairing and Hey Siri but Buds Studio also play nice with Android phones supporting Google Fast Pair and touch controls thanks to the Beats app.

We've got offers from Bose too with the QC SE and Bose 700 coming in as direct competitors to the Sony WH-1000X headphones. The 700s are especially nice with their modern design and flagship ANC which is right up there with the Sony WF-1000XM5.

Sennheiser has its Momentum 4 headphones on offer too. These offer improved microphones for better calls, alongside a 60-hour battery life and potent ANC.

Huawei's FreeBuds 5i are an excellent pair of wireless buds with ANC that don't break the bank. We were impressed with their ability to drown out unwanted noise, quick connectivity and smudge-resistant charging case.

Anker's Soundcore brand has several options with the Soundcore Life Q30 over-the-ear headphones coming in first. These wireless headphones offer impressive specs like 40 hours of total playtime, Active noise cancellation and multi-point pairing. They also come with a stylish design and the Soundcore app allows you to fine-tune their output and ANC to your preference.

If you're after a pair of in-ear wireless buds with ANC and potent battery life then the Liberty 4 NC are worth looking into. These buds offer Hi-Res audio streaming with support for the LDAC codec and can hold up to 10 hours on a single charge with the case offering up to 5 recharges.

Our ears come in all shapes and sizes and finding a good-fitting pair of earbuds is no easy feat. The Soundcore Sport X10 offer a sporty design with swiveling ear hooks tailored to those working out and are IPX7 rated.

Tozo Open Buds are another great option for runners and those who don't like in-ear buds. Their open-ear design and excellent fit coupled with decent sound output and great battery endurance also impressed us during our review.
