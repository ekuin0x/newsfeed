                <textarea id="text" readonly> New Zealand are set to resume their tour of Bangladesh after a hiatus caused by the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023. The Kiwis, having clinched the three-match ODI series 2-0 (with the first match being washed out), are geared up for a two-test series starting from Tuesday, November 28. (Cricket News)

In a significant development, Bangladesh have entrusted the test captaincy to left-handed batter Najmul Hossain Shanto. This marks Shanto's debut as the test side's leader, building on his prior experience captaining during the ODI Cricket World Cup in India when Shakib Al Hasan was sidelined due to injury.

Unfortunately, Bangladesh will miss the services of pacer Taskin Ahmed, who is sidelined with a shoulder injury, embarking on a rehabilitation journey. Shakib Al Hasan, the regular Test skipper, is also unavailable after sustaining a finger injury during the World Cup clash against Sri Lanka.

Meanwhile, New Zealand's lineup sees the return of Rachin Ravindra, a standout performer in the recently concluded ODI World Cup in India. Ravindra, who last played a test in January 2022 against Bangladesh, is set to make a comeback. The Kiwi test squad also includes left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner and versatile all-rounder Kyle Jamieson, adding depth and skill to their roster.
