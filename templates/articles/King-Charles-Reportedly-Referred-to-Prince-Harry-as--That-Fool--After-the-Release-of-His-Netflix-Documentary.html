                <textarea id="text" readonly> King Charles wasn't happy after watching Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Netflix documentary — to say the least. In a newly-released excerpt from Omid Scobie's upcoming book Endgame, it's reported that Charles was left fuming over the couple's claims in the docuseries Harry and Meghan, prompting him to openly mock his son around the Palace.



“At the palace, heads were in hands and migraines were brewing. [The Netflix series] took the wind out of everyone’s sails,” a royal aide told Scobie, adding that Charles "went from not wanting anyone to talk about his son to openly criticizing ‘that fool.’”



They continued, "The King was genuinely sad about the entire situation. He was angry but didn’t want people to speak ill of his son in front of him, either. It was a brief moment where he paused and realized how bad things had become.” Scobie noted that Charles's sympathy "soon disappeared" after the media attention from the docuseries "eclipsed" him "at every turn."

Elsewhere in the book, Scobie recalled another point of tension between Charles and Harry. It came after the monarch made the decision to evict Harry and Meghan from Frogmore Cottage, as they were no longer living in the U.K.

According to Scobie, the Sussexes were "shocked" by the news and during a heated phone call, Harry reportedly asked his father: "Don't you want to see your grandchildren?" His question was met with silence by Charles, who later promised his son that his family would always have "somewhere" to stay when they visited.
