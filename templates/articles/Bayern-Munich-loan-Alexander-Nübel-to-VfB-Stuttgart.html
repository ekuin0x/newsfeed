                <textarea id="text" readonly> Bayern Munich goalkeeper Alexander Nübel will spend the 2023/24 season on loan at VfB Stuttgart.

Nübel, who has made 47 Bundesliga appearances to date, spent the last two campaigns on loan at Monaco.

The 26-year-old is expected to be first choice at Stuttgart, following the south-west club's sale of Florian Müller to Freiburg.

"The talks with [sporting director] Fabian Wohlgemuth and [head coach] Sebastian Hoeneß were key in my decision to join VfB," Nübel told the Stuttgart website. "They told me about the club, the city and the brilliant atmosphere inside the stadium with the wonderful support they get from the fans.

"I'm really pleased to be back in the Bundesliga with VfB. I've already played with Waldemar Anton and Maximilian Mittelstädt for the national team. Together with them and the rest of the players, I'm going to prepare as best I can for what will hopefully be a successful season."

Nübel made 97 appearances for Monaco across 2021/22 and 2022/23, keeping 24 clean sheets. The former Germany U21 international, who joined Bayern on a five-year deal in summer 2020, has also turned out 53 times for Schalke, including 47 in the Bundesliga. He is a product of the Paderborn youth academy.

"Alex is an outstanding goalkeeper who has proven his qualities in the Bundesliga and with Monaco in recent years," enthused Wohlgemuth. "We're pleased that he's has opted for VfB and that we were able to bring the negotiations with FC Bayern to a successful conclusion. It was always our intention to sign him, if the opportunity arose."

Nübel could make his unofficial Stuttgart debut as early as 29 July, when VfB face 1860 Munich and Borussia Mönchengladbach in a pre-season mini tournament. They play Sheffield United on 5 August, before kicking off the new season against minnows Balingen in the DFB Cup first round (12 August). A week later, Hoeneß's team - who retained their top-flight status in 2022/23 via the play-off - host Bochum in their Bundesliga opener (19 August). </textarea>
