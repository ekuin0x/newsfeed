                <textarea id="text" readonly> Bose needs no introduction; their QuietComfort headphones have set the bar for noise cancellation and sound quality for years and years. Unfortunately, Bose headphones aren't exactly cheap, so the best time to pick one up is during the rare occasion they go on sale. During the Amazon Cyber Monday Sale, the Bose QuietComfort 45 wireless active noise cancelling over-ear headphones has dropped to $199. That's a 40% discount off the $329 MSRP and the best price we've seen all year. It's also $50 cheaper than its closest competitor, the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones.

Cyber Monday Deal: 40% Off the Bose QuietComfort 45 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones $199

Bose QuietComfort 45 Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones 40% off $329.00 12 $199.00 See on Amazon

Up until last month, the Bose QuietComfort 45 was the newest model in the lineup after the QC35 II's nearly 5 year reign (the newer QuietComfort Ultra came out in October). This is the first of the QuietComfort headphones to finally get rid of the legacy Micro USB connector in favor of USB Type-C. The QC45 boasts up to 24 hours of battery life on a single charge and it also supports fast charging, which gives you 3 hours of juice after only 15 minutes of plugging into a fast charging adapter.

New to the QuietComfort 45 is its "Aware Mode", which works exactly like the Transparency Mode you'll find on other premium noise cancelling headphones. Unlike the traditional "Silent Mode" which activates noise cancellation and suppresses ambient noise, "Aware Mode" picks up ambient noises and amplifies them so that you can listen in on the outside world without having to take off your headphones.

Besides these two niceties, the 45 is mostly unchanged from its predecessor. The 45 does offer better passive noise isolation thanks to the tighter fit and less porous material of the new earpads, but then again the 35 already had pretty outstanding noise cancellation to being with.

If you haven't already invested in a pair of noise-cancelling headphones, you're missing out. Active noise cancelling is a miracle of science that has huge practical benefits, especially if you're always on the go in busy, noisy environments. The Bose QuietComfort 45 offers one of the best iterations of this this technology, and it is very well worth the money spent. If you're looking to buy a noise cancelling headphone right now, and you're budget conscious, there's no better option than this Cyber Monday deal. </textarea>
