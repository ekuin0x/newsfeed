                <textarea id="text" readonly> RUDRAPUR: Two Sikh brothers from Pilibhit have donated 12 acres of their land, estimated to be worth over Rs 5 crore, to 16 needy farmers in Khatima, US Nagar district of Uttarakhand, ahead of Guru Nanak's birthday (Gurpurab) on Tuesday.During this monsoon, the Uttarakhand farmers' land in the area had been washed away by Parvin river, a tributary of Sharda, and their story had reached the siblings in Pilibhit, UP.The brothers, Balwinder and Harpal Singh , both wealthy farmers from Bhagataniya village, said they were moved by the other farmers' plight and decided to donate them land ahead of the auspicious occasion. They plan to give away four more acres soon.On Sunday, they handed over land documents to chairman of Kanchanpur Society (local cooperative body) B Singh and revenue officer Hansu Lal in the presence of villagers and beneficiaries."To spread the message of humanity, we have decided to donate 16 acres of land to those farmers who had lost their only source of income during the monsoon. And what could be more auspicious than the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji?" Balwinder said, adding that they are four brothers who own around 125 acres of farmland in Uttarakhand and UP.Two of them live abroad. We discussed with them and decided to support these farmers," Balwinder said. "I just can't find enough words to express my gratitude to the two brothers," said Vijay Pal Singh Rana, who got close to an acre of land. Another farmer, Karan Singh Rana, said that people in their village lost over 20 acres of land this monsoon due to soil erosion caused by floodwater from the nearby river. "Not just those who received the land, even those villagers who didn't have sent up prayers to god," he said. "Because all of us are connected. Charity like this is hard to come by." </textarea>
