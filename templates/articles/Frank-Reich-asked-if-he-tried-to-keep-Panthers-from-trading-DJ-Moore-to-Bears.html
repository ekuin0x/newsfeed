                <textarea id="text" readonly> Frank Reich asked if he tried to keep Panthers from trading DJ Moore to Bears

Carolina Panthers head coach Frank Reich never got to coach one of the franchise’s all-time leading receivers. But even he knows how much DJ Moore meant to the organization.

Just two days ahead of his team’s Thursday night showdown against the Chicago Bears, Reich was asked about the dearly-departed wideout. He had nothing but praise for Moore.

“I just know from the tape, big-time playmaker, can do it all, vertical threat,” Reich stated. “But also, truly one of those guys who can do it all. Everyone knows he’s the vertical threat. But he’s a skilled route runner, he can make the plays deep, he can make the underneath stuff, crossing route—there’s nothing he can’t do. So, really great player.

“And then, of course, you hear about the person. You come in this building, he made quite an impression on the people in this building with who he is as a person. Class act.”

Moore made an impression in their record books, closing up his five-year tenure in Charlotte with the fourth-most receiving yards in team history. His 5,201 yards sit behind only the totals of franchise legends Steve Smith Sr., Muhsin Muhammad and Greg Olsen.

He also made another impression on the Bears, who pried him away from the Panthers in their deal for this year’s No. 1 overall pick. Chicago—in sending over control of the 2023 NFL draft—received Moore as well as two first-round picks and two second-round picks from Carolina.

Reich was then asked if he had a say in trying to keep Moore from being included in the blockbuster trade.

“Knew he was a great player,” he replied. “But when you find your quarterback, gotta go all in. And you can’t look back. And those are really hard decisions. And especially what makes it harder is, even though I didn’t know him, I know that it’d be even harder for everyone else here that did know him. But when you find a quarterback that you want, you have to be willing to make that deal.”

That deal, of course, landed the Panthers Bryce Young.
