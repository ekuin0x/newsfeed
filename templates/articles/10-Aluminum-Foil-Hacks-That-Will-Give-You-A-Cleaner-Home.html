                <textarea id="text" readonly> 10 Aluminum Foil Hacks That Will Give You A Cleaner Home

There's no doubt that there are plenty of uses for aluminum foil. In fact, it was first used in the U.S. for commercial purposes in 1913 when it was used to wrap candy like Life Savers and chocolate bars. It was then used for cartons before eventually making its way into homes in the 1920s. Now, it's the go-to for covering food and even cooking, not to mention countless crafts. On top of that, it's also an ideal tool for keeping your home clean in more ways than you might have imagined.

Thanks to the fact that aluminum foil is rather thin, it can be shaped, folded, and crumpled as needed which makes it great to use on rounded items, in corners, and other hard-to-reach spots. It's also somewhat tough and abrasive which helps you really scrub things that have become dirty, grimy, and gritty. While that might have already sparked a few ideas of how aluminum foil could help you tackle various chores around your abode, we can suggest a few hacks that you definitely don't want to miss out on. </textarea>
