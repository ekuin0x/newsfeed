Union Berlin struck three times in 17 minutes in the second half to cruise to a 3-0 victory over struggling VfB Stuttgart on Saturday, tightening their grip on third spot and staying in the mix for the Bundesliga title.

Union, who are playing their best ever season, scored on the break with Sheraldo Becker's eighth league goal of the campaign six minutes after the restart.

Kevin Behrens then doubled their advantage from close range in the 65th. His effort was initially overruled by VAR but that decision was subsequently corrected and the goal stood.

Only three minutes later Behrens broke clear down the right wing and whipped the ball into the box only for Stuttgart midfielder Genki Haraguchi to slide in and send it into his own goal as he tried to clear it.

Union, the only team along with leaders Bayern Munich to remain unbeaten at home this season, are on 51 points, four behind the Bavarians who are back on top following their 4-2 victory over second-placed Borussia Dortmund, who have 53.

Freiburg lost ground after their 1-1 draw against Hertha Berlin, leaving them in fourth on 47 while fellow Champions League hopefuls RB Leipzig suffered a shock 3-0 home loss to Mainz to stay fifth on 45. </textarea>
