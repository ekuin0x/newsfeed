                <textarea id="text" readonly> A frail-looking Bruce Willis was in high spirits as he spent precious time with his family on Thanksgiving.

The “Die Hard” star’s daughter, Scout, 32, shared heartwarming video of the 68-year-old actor clutching her hand as they enjoyed their Turkey Day feast.

The clip — shared to Instagram — was followed by a sweet image of the two, which showed Scout resting her head in Willis’ palm.

Scout is the second oldest of the action star’s five daighters.

Willis and ex-wife Demi Moore share Scout and daughters Rumer, 35, and Tallulah, 29.

The “Sixth Sense” star also has two daughters with his now-wife Emma Heming Willis — Mabel, 11, and Evelyn, 9.

Scout’s Thanksgiving footage comes after “Moonlighting” creator Glenn Gordon Caron revealed that the Willis’ was “not totally verbal” following his frontotemporal dementia diagnosis earlier this year.

Since his diagnosis, the actor’s children have shared bittersweet images online, including one from daughter Rumer who admitted in an accompanying caption that she was “really missing” her dad.

Meanwhile, Tallulah gushed about how “proud” she was of her “whole damn heart” on Instagram, after revealing the details of her father’s “aggressive” and “rare” dementia on “The Drew Barrymore Show.”

“He is the same, which I think in this regard I’ve learned is the best thing you can ask for,” Tallulah told Barrymore earlier this month.

On Nov. 11, Emma, 45, admitted that she felt “guilt” for having “resources” amid her husband’s dementia battle, writing in an article for Maria Shriver’s Sunday Paper that she acknowledges “not all care partners” have the opportunity to go on a hike to “clear their head.”

Bruce’s dementia diagnosis has also become an opportunity to bring awareness to the disease.

“When what I share about our family’s journey gets press attention, I know that there are many thousands of untold, unheard stories, each of them deserving of compassion and concern,” Emma wrote.

She added: “I want people to know that when I hear from another family affected by FTD, I hear our family’s same story of grief, loss, and immense sadness echoed in theirs.” </textarea>
