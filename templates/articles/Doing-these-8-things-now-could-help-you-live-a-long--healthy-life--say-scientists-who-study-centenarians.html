Scientists who study centenarians have identified eight common personality traits in super-agers. They recommended nurturing these qualities in yourself now because they may help you live longer.

Researchers at the Complutense University of Madrid, Spain, conducted in-depth interviews with 19 Spanish centenarians to find out if they shared positive personality traits that may have helped them cope with the challenges, traumas, and difficulties of life.

The participants were aged between 100 and 107 years old, showed no signs of dementia or cognitive impairment, and were able to do daily activities independently. Of the 19, 16 were women and three were men.

The study , published November 8 in the Journal of Happiness Studies, identified eight traits that all the centenarians had, and the authors made recommendations based on these that they say could help us mere mortals become healthy super-agers.

The authors also acknowledged the study had limitations, the biggest one being that it did not take into account if these traits were simply more common in this generation generally, and more research would be needed to clear this up.

Be active and don't sit on the sidelines

All 19 centenarians had always lived active lives and showed a desire to continue living, the study said. They were the sorts of people who always kept busy and enjoyed doing things.

"I was sewing until I was 98 (referring to her profession as a dressmaker). Now, I like to do crossword puzzles and I give the sudokus a try. I go downstairs in the elevator, but I walk up the stairs, to exercise my legs," a 100-year-old woman who participated in the study told the authors.

A 100-year-old man said: "At 6 p.m. is the party for the grandparents and I'm going to go. Also, there's bingo and I don't want to miss it."

The study's authors recommended maintaining a lively attitude and being both physically and intellectually active.

Another recent study found that even walking an extra 500 steps a day could help you live longer.

Enjoy and nurture your relationships

A wealth of evidence suggests close relationships can help you live longer. This is something widely observed in the world's Blue Zones , which are regions where people live a decade longer than the country's average.

In the study, the authors noted that the participants tended to enjoy spending time with people, were talkative, and said that they were generally well-liked.

"I've always liked to have friends and get along well with everyone," said a 101-year-old man.

"The best thing in my life are my children, grandchildren, and the great-grandchildren, who love me more than the grandchildren," a 104-year-old woman said.

As well as this, most participants reported that they were quick to help others without being asked.

The authors added that people should let their loved ones know that they love them, take care of social relationships, and be willing to help others.

Their recommendations have parallels with a recent study that found visiting family could help them live longer .

Take your commitments seriously

The centenarians took their responsibilities in life seriously, whether it was work, childcare, or being a good friend, the study said. They were generally honest people who excelled because they were reliable and happy to take on responsibilities.

"My bosses really valued me. I was with them for seven years and the day I got married the lady of the house cried as if she were my mother," a 103-year-old woman said.

When challenges arose, they took on a "can-do" attitude, the study said.

A 107-year-old woman said: "When we returned to Spain (from Cuba), I was the one who worked and kept the family afloat. Castro kept our money, and my husband didn't work."

A 101-year-old woman said: "Four years ago, I broke my hip, and a month or so later I was already walking, without crutches, without a walker or anything. I'm very determined."

The authors recommended having an attitude of commitment, responsibility, honesty, and perseverance throughout life.

Take control of your own life

Taking control of your own life by having confidence in your own decisions, adapting to your surroundings, and seeking out opportunities was common among the centenarians, the study said.

"I've always followed my own judgment, even though others told me no, and time has proved me right," a 100-year-old woman said.

"I found out they needed a person to work in Washington at the press attaché's home and I went, but I didn't know the language or anything," a 102-year-old woman said.

Based on this, the authors said that people should set realistic short or medium-term goals and commit to achieving them.

They also said that it's good to get out of your comfort zone and establish daily habits so that you don't become overwhelmed.

Be curious

Another common trait was curiosity, and many of the participants showed a continued desire to learn and try new things.

"I started traveling with a friend after my husband died. I liked traveling a lot, but he didn't. I was almost 80 years old, every year we went to a different place. We've been to Paris, Rome, Berlin, Brussels, Warsaw, Jerusalem, Turkey," a 100-year-old woman said.

Others taught themselves to read, write, or sew, and still stay up to date with current affairs.

The authors recommended learning about different cultures, traveling, and learning new skills such as painting.

Be grateful for what you've got

Despite experiencing difficulties in life, the participants were able to be grateful for the good things and enjoy them, the study said.

"Well, life has given me everything, thank God. It has given me disappointments, like losing relatives, but thank God I haven't had a bad time," a 100-year-old woman said.

The authors suggested learning to identify and be grateful for daily positive experiences and focus on what's good in our lives.

Look for a silver lining

Having a willingness to carry on when adversity hits was a common trait among the centenarians.

"I was very close to my wife. I was 97 years old when she died and my daughter didn't think I'd get over it. At first, I was bad off, but then I thought that you only live once and you have to be strong, that my wife wouldn't like to see me feeling bad," a 101-year-old man said.

It's important to develop resilience and accept negative and stressful experiences as a natural part of life, the authors said.

Challenge your mind

Many of the centenarians were naturally intelligent, the study said. "They have successful academic and professional results, are self-taught, are problem-solvers, they take on challenges even though they are not specifically trained and succeed."

The authors suggested engaging your brain by trying to solve problems that get more challenging as time goes on. </textarea>
