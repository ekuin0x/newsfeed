                <textarea id="text" readonly> Second-choice Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Alexander Meyer is said to be high on VfB Stuttgart’s list of targets for this summer.

Signing a new goalkeeper appears to a priority for VfB Stuttgart this summer. And they are reportedly interested in bringing in Alexander Meyer. According to Sky Sport, the second-choice Borussia Dortmund shot-stopper is high on the Swabians’ list of targets.

The report adds that Stuttgart have yet to hold concrete talks with Borussia Dortmund over Meyer’s signature. But they could step up their interest in the 32 year old after the future of Florian Müller is resolved. SC Freiburg are said to be interested in signing him.

Müller joined Stuttgart in 2021 as a replacement for Gregor Kobel, who made the switch to Borussia Dortmund. But the 25 year old lost his spot in the team to Fabian Bredlow recently. And Stuttgart are now looking for a new first-choice goalkeeper, after being left unconvinced by the duo.

Alexander Meyer only joined Borussia Dortmund last summer on a free transfer from second division side SSV Jahn Regensburg. He made a total of 12 appearances for the Black and Yellows in the recently concluded season, and managed to keep three clean sheets. Meyer is a former Stuttgart player, but never played for their senior team during his spell with the club from 2017 to 2019.

Meyer is behind Gregor Kobel in the pecking order at Borussia Dortmund, with the Swiss international one of the top goalkeepers in the Bundesliga. So the prospect of playing regularly in the Bundesliga may prove to be an enticing one for him. </textarea>
