                <textarea id="text" readonly> We’ve officially reached the point of Cyber Monday where we've bought everything we need except maybe one to two things. Until the day is over, I’ll have the looming feeling that I forgot to add something to my cart. So I took to Amazon to see what I might have missed and discovered there are tons of last-minute deals you can still shop that are all under $50. Turns out my gut feeling of “you’re missing something” was right — I had overlooked this entire treasure trove of affordable buys.

So to help you quickly shop the retailer’s best (and cheapest!) deals, I rounded up the top can’t-miss items. Shop our 130 last-minute, under-$50 Cyber Monday picks below:



Amazon

Best Overall Last-Chance Cyber Monday Deals

Some of Cyber Monday’s best under-$50 deals are from the brands you know and love. The Drop’s Jaclyn Cutout-Back Mock-Neck Sweater, which is 75 percent off, is the best deal of the day, while Laneige’s Lip Sleeping Mask is on rare sale at just $18. You’ll also find Hanes’s Crewneck Sweatshirt is now just $10 while Olaplex’s viral Hair Perfector No 3 Repairing Treatment is currently 30 percent off. And prepping for winter, I’m of course adding this electric blanket to my cart while it’s 44 percent off, as well as these now-$25 fleece-lined leggings.

Best Fashion Last-Chance Cyber Monday Deals

Finding quality fashion pieces under $50 can be tricky — but today, the options are kind of endless. Levi's iconic, 100-percent cotton Wedgie Straight Jeans, which shoppers say “make your butt look incredible,” are 47 percent off, while Keds’ Kickback Canvas Slip-On Sneakers are on sale for just $36. Other great deals include this 56-percent off sweater jacket from Anrabess, Amazon Essentials now-$11 underwear pack, and Dream Pair’s on-trend knee-high boots. And if you’re looking for the perfect holiday gift (for loved ones or yourself), you have to grab Victoria's Secret Flannel Long Pajama Set while it’s 40 percent off.

Amazon

Best Beauty Last-Chance Cyber Monday Deals

In terms of beauty, you’ll find that you can get shopper-loved body, skin, and haircare, as well as makeup, for under $50 today. My personal recommendations are this lightweight but super hydrating body oil that’s currently on sale for $8 (which my mom and I are both obsessed with) as well as Tula’s skin tint, which blurs my imperfections while providing UV coverage. Other must-have deals include Nioxin’s hair-thickening treatment, which shoppers say “instantly made [their] hair appear thicker” and Covergirl’s beloved Lash Blast Mascara, which is now just $7.

Amazon

Best Home and Tech Last-Chance Cyber Monday Deals

Tech and home goods can often be a splurge, but right now, the items you need and want can be found for under $50. I have been waiting for O-Cedar’s Easywring Spin Mop to finally go on sale and am of course grabbing Yeti’s never-on-sale Rambler Travel Mug while it’s 25 percent off. I am also eyeing this now-$17 vegetable chopper (a must-have for all lazy cooks), this 30-percent-off space heater, and Yankee Candle’s now-$22 Dried Lavender and Oak​ Scented Candle. And while it might not be the most thrilling, a towel-set is, IMO, one of those holiday gifts that can make anyone happy, so why not grab this six-piece set while it’s 41 percent off?
