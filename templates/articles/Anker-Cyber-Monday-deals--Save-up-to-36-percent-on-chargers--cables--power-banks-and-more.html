Cyber Monday is now in full swing on Amazon, bringing even more savings on electronics in post-Black Friday deals. It’s a great time to get stocked up for all your home and on-the-go charging needs, with steep discounts on Anker’s highly rated chargers, cables and power banks. There are discounts of 30 to 40 percent off some of Anker’s most useful devices, including its 20,000mAh Prime Power Bank and the compact Prime 67W fast wall charger with three ports. Here are Amazon’s best Cyber Monday deals on Anker devices.

Anker Prime 100W USB-C Fast Charger

Anker’s Prime 100W fast charger is great for when you need to charge multiple devices at once. It has two USB-C ports and a USB-A port, with a maximum output of 100W when using two ports at once. That means your devices will charge up pretty quickly. It’s compatible with most popular smartphones, including the flagships from Apple, Samsung and Google, and is strong enough to charge your iPad and MacBook.

Anker Prime 67W USB C Charger

The 67W Prime charger from Anker is another fast-charging option for multiple devices, though it’s a bit less powerful than its 100W sibling. For single devices, it’ll max out at 67W, while charging two devices at once will be capped at 65W. It’s compact, at about half the size of Apple’s MacBook charger of the same wattage, and has three ports: two USB-C and one USB-A. It plugs directly into the wall, with two prongs that fold away for easier storage when it’s not plugged in.

Anker Prime Power Bank 200W, 20,000mAh

If you want your devices charged as fast as possible, the Anker Prime Power Bank 200W is the one for you. Anker says this portable power bank will get your device from zero to 10 percent in just 5 minutes, and can get a 16-inch MacBook Pro to 50 percent within 40 minutes. This power bank also comes with three ports (two USB-C and one USB-A), making it compatible with a wide range of devices. It comes with a compact 100W charging base that can recharge the power bank to full capacity in an hour and 15 minutes.

Anker 333 USB-C Cable 3-Pack

You can never have too many cables, especially since they always seem to go missing. Anker is running a deal on a three-pack of 100W USB-C cables, meaning they support fast charging. The pack comes with three sizes — 3.3-foot, 6-foot, and 10-foot — and they should work with most popular smartphones, laptops and tablets. They’re wrapped in braided nylon, so they should be pretty durable, too.

Anker Nano Power Bank, 5,000mAh

Anker’s Nano Power Bank is both adorable and convenient. The 5,000mAh portable charger has a built-in USB-C connector that folds away when you’re not using it, so it’s easy to toss in a bag. It maxes out at 22.5W, so while it may not be the fastest charging option out there, it’ll still juice your devices up pretty quickly. Anker says it will get an iPhone 15 to 43 percent charge in 30 minutes. It comes in five colors, but the Cyber Monday deal is for the Shell White version.

Anker Nano Power Bank, 10,000mAh

The 10,000mAh Nano Power Bank offers faster charging speeds and more power storage than the aforementioned version, plus bi-directional charging. Anker says it can bring an iPhone 15 from zero to 50 percent in 30 minutes, at a maximum output of 30W. It has a USB-C and a USB-A port, and a short USB-C cable that tucks away when you don’t need it.
