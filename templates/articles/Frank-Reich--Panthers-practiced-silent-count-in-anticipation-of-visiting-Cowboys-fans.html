                <textarea id="text" readonly> Bank of America Stadium has served as a getaway destination for many a fan base over the past few years. So, the home of the Carolina Panthers should be quite a hot spot for “America’s Team” this weekend.

On Friday, just 48 hours between his team’s Week 11 matchup against the Dallas Cowboys, head coach Frank Reich spoke about the possibility of another invasion on their own turf. When asked if his offense practiced their silent count in anticipation of visiting Cowboys fans, he provided a pretty honest answer.

“Yes,” he replied. “I think everybody knows how well Dallas travels. We have a great city that other fans like to come to. We’re prepared, we’ve practiced silent count this week, if we have to use it. So, we’re prepared either way.”

Other fans, for at least the last three seasons, have really, really liked coming to Charlotte. Between 2021 and 2023, Bank of America Stadium has experienced takeovers by the Philadelphia Eagles, New England Patriots, San Francisco 49ers and the Minnesota Vikings (twice).

Given the continued struggles of the Panthers and the, um, overwhelming popularity of the Cowboys, we may feel like we’re deep in the heart of Texas on Sunday afternoon.
