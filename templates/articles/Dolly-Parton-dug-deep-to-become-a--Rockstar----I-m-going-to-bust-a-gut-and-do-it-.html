                <textarea id="text" readonly> All it took was some skepticism to propel Dolly Parton to write a rock album.

The undisputed heroine of country music memorably declined her 2022 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame nomination because she didn’t think her career befitted that of a typical rock star.

But she later acquiesced and accepted the induction with the promise she would prove to herself – and anyone who doubted her bona fide musical talent – that a country queen can readily morph into a rock ‘n’ roll empress.

Parton, 77, spent the past year not only recording a wallop of an album – 30 songs on the fittingly titled “Rockstar,” out now – but recruiting an astounding lineup of musicians across generations to join her on covers of their hits.

From Pink to Peter Frampton, Joan Jett to Judas Priest's Rob Halford, and the two living Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, the rock elite readily accepted the invite to sing with Parton.

Many of the songs on “Rockstar” were recorded in separate locations. But Parton romped through studio sessions with Heart’s Ann Wilson (“Magic Man”), Blondie’s Debbie Harry (“Heart of Glass”), John Fogerty (“Long As I Can See the Light”) and Stevie Nicks (the original song, “What Has Rock and Roll Ever Done for You”), among others.

Chatting from her Tennessee enclave, the ever-gracious and forthright Parton dove into details about converting into a “Rockstar.”

Question: You said you picked songs that you knew you could sing. But did any present a vocal challenge since you’re singing like Mick Jagger, Debbie Harry, or Robert Plant, who are very different types of singers?

Answer: There were moments in the studio where I challenged myself. I thought, "I wonder if I can hit that note I hear in my head? I wonder if my voice will do that." So I really had a lot of fun and thought, "Well, I'm going to go for it." And so I was very proud of myself because there were certain notes I hit. But I got in a different space in my head because I was doing rock ‘n’ roll. I was trying to think like if I was one of the people who had grown up in rock ‘n’ roll. I thought they busted a gut trying to do it, so I’m going to bust a gut and do it.

You have a handful of original songs on here, like “World on Fire” and “My Blue Tears.” Why was it important to you to mix in some new material?

I’m a publisher and a writer and I wanted to have some of my own (songs on the album) and I thought if it’s a big album, I want to put that money in my publishing company and I wanted (people) to think I could write something that was fitting for a record like this. I co-wrote a lot of them with (album producer) Kent Wells. I wanted to put that in his publishing company as well. But we wanted to feel like we were a big part of (the process) because we were very into this album together.

Did any of the artists surprise you?

I was really, really proud of Sting. I love “Every Breath You Take” and when I asked Sting, I sent him my version and he was very complimentary and he said I would love to try some things. He did all these beautiful harmonies himself and I did three-part harmonies, so it was just the two of us on that record and it sounded like a whole bunch of people. Same thing with Steve Perry (on “Open Arms”). We spent a lot of time working on the harmonies.

Having Lizzo play flute on “Stairway to Heaven” is an inspired choice. When did you become aware of her flute skills?

I had seen her on TV and heard her talk about it and seen her play it. I knew there was flute on the original record, so rather than get a studio musician, we thought why not get Lizzo? She was hot at the time and she just killed it. I loved it. She’s great on that flute. It’s so great she named it, Sasha – Sasha Flute – just like a person. (Laughs.)

Your husband, Carl, is a big fan of that song. Does he like this version?

Yes! He didn’t care for the one I did with a bluegrass-country flavor (in 2002), but when he heard this he said, "That’s pretty good." That was high praise for him to say that. He’s such a rock fan. He just thought there’s a few things other people shouldn’t do – “Stairway” and “Free Bird” – and I did them both. (Laughs.) I wasn’t trying to defy him; I just wanted to do those songs if I wanted to do a rock album. “Purple Rain,” “Stairway to Heaven” and “Free Bird”: I have to do those three.

You sing with your goddaughter Miley Cyrus on “Wrecking Ball.” How special was it to sing one of her songs?

It was necessary for me. I love that song and I love Miley. But she was one of the first people I thought about. I knew I had to have her on my rock album because Miley is the new rock chick in my mind. I love her whole voice, her whole persona, she’s just a rock star. And she’s my goddaughter and I’ve loved her all my life and we’re very close and we sing great together. I’m really proud of that.

I love how you worked in “I Will Always Love You” at the end of “Wrecking Ball.” How did that come about?

Last year I did a show in Miami with Miley for New Year’s Eve and we did “Wrecking Ball” and “I Will Always Love You” as two separate songs. So when we got in the studio and I was doing my backgrounds (vocals), that just came to me to throw in a few lines on the spot.

You got the two living Beatles to collaborate with you. Was there ever a “is this really happening” moment when you’re with McCartney and Starr on “Let It Be”?

I had known Paul. I’d met him on different occasions to say hi or talk about Nashville. So I asked him if he would sing with me on it and he said, “Yes, and I’ll play piano if you want me to.” So that, of course, sent me over the moon. So then I thought if I could get Ringo to replace the drums that I had on there, that would be great to have the two living Beatles on the same record. But then Peter Frampton played a little on it and Mick Fleetwood plays some percussion, so that made it even more special.

Now that this album is finished, is there another major project you still want to tackle?

I’m tackling one right now. I’m doing my life story as a Broadway musical. I’ve written the music and am recording it now. The script is done, so it’s more about the music and starting to cast. So my next big album will probably be my cast album. I don’t have any plans to record any other music, but I’m doing some songs for several country artists. I did another song with Zach Williams and maybe I’ll get to work with some rockers and do some rock songs on their albums.

Is there a time frame for your musical?

We’re hoping to have it onstage in 2025. I’ve been working on it forever. It’s not a jukebox musical, it’s a true story. It’s a big production and a lot of original songs. Of course, it will have the hit songs and the stories leading up to those things. I had at one time planned to do a biopic but then everybody was doing one so I thought nah, I’m going Broadway. So I’m hoping we make it.
