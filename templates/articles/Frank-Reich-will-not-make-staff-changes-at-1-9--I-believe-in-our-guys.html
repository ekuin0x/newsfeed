                <textarea id="text" readonly> Frank Reich will not make staff changes at 1-9: I believe in our guys

At 1-9, something has to change for the lowly Carolina Panthers. And if it does, it won’t come at the expense of the coaching staff—at least not yet.

Head coach Frank Reich spoke with reporters on Monday following his team’s 33-10 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. When asked if he’s planning on making any adjustments to the sideline, Reich swatted the idea away.

“I believe in our guys, strongly,” he said. “Players and coaches. And so, when it comes to players, you got 53 players. We’re all one team. So one guy might play more, one guy might play less. But you believe in all those guys.

“And when it comes to the coaching staff, you got one per position. Feel great about the staff. We’re always lookin’ to get better, every coach. Starting with me.”

Week 11’s outing against the visiting Cowboys marked the team’s third straight defeat. The loss was headlined by a number of self-inflicted wounds, most notably through six defensive penalties, and another underwhelming performance on offense.

The Panthers totaled 187 yards and scored one touchdown, just their fourth visit to the end zone in as many weeks.
