Best Vacuums and Home Appliance Deals

iRobot Roomba I1 Wi-Fi Connected Robot Vacuum $330 $200 Wayfair

iRobot knows a thing or two about making the best robot vacuums. The I1 connects to your Wi-Fi and runs on your schedule so you can come home to clean floors every day (if that's your thing), plus you can have Google assistant or Alexa help you make the schedule. It has a 90-minute runtime and a three-stage cleaning system to ensure a squeaky clean home. This model, specifically, is made to clean in neat, organized rows, so you can be sure your floors are getting a thorough clean.

Much like Dyson’s V8 vVacuum, the brand’s lineup of air purifiers has been lauded among those in the home and design worlds—us included. This includes the discounted Purifier Cool Autoreact TP7A. The purifying fan comes with a remote for easy adjustments and can be linked to your phone with the Dyson app. There you’ll find all kinds of data about your air quality, with no effort on your part. The HEPA filter captures 99.97% of particles 0.3 microns in size and maximizes the air being spread throughout your room thanks to powerful air multiplier technology.

Wayfair Cyber Monday: Furniture Deals

Sealy Cool 12" Medium Memory Foam Mattress $1,199 $430 Wayfair

While the term “cool” in the bedroom used to refer to the other side of the pillow, you’ll now find pillows, sheets and even mattresses laden with cooling technology, promising an end to the night sweats. The Sealy Cool 12” is counts itself as one of the top cooling mattresses in the game. It features a medium firm memory foam infused with SealyCool gel and Copper Cool technology, providing ample support and cooling all night long. It comes rolled up in a box for convenient delivery and setup and is designed and assembled in the USA.

17 Stories Bed Frame with 2-Tier Storage Headboard and Power Outlets $215 $200 Wayfair

Once you’ve found your mattress, take advantage of the other Wayfair sleep deals and snag a frame to fit your new bed. This frame comes with built-in plugs, so you can always keep your devices charged and two-tiered storage on the headboard perfect for books, art or a zillion half-empty cups.

We tested this budget sleeper sofa ourselves and were very pleased with the results, especially considering the price point. Reviewer Rachel Fletcher said had this to say: ”This is a sofa bed (vs. a sleeper sofa), so it is designed to be used without a mattress. You unfold the sofa, slap on a sheet (I had better luck with a flat sheet than a fitted), and your bed is ready for the evening. If you enjoy a firm sleeping surface (which I tend to), this is right up your alley.”

Loloi Sorrento Oriental Machine Made Power Loom Polyester Area Rug $569 $234 Wayfair

You can get up to 80% off area rugs during Wayfair’s Cyber Monday event, including this machine-made rug from Loloi. The price above is for the 7’10” x 10’2” rug size, but there are over 10 sizes to choose from, meaning you can find a rug to fit any space. The Sorrento Oriental rug is power-loomed in Turkey from 100% Oeko-Tex certified polyester pile, meaning you won’t have to deal with any pungent smells or harmful chemicals upon arrival.

Joss & Main, one of the bigger brands under the Wayfair umbrella, makes all types of home goods, from sideboards to wall decor to sectionals, like the one linked above. The Bobbi Chaise Sectional comes fully-assembled, meaning it’s exceptionally easy to put together. The cushions have removable covers for easy cleaning and are made from comfy foam and feathers. Use code SAVE25 to secure the deal at checkout.

Chateau 41" Corner Electric Fireplace by Real Flame $875 $533 Wayfair

Electric fireplaces are trending right now. Is this the year you make a high tech heater happen for your home? This one, currently 53% off, is perfectly suited for an empty corner your room may have. It comes in three shades (white, espresso, and dark walnut) as comes with fast, free shipping—it will be at your door before the end of the week if you act soon. Another benefit? You’ll have a brand new mantle for displaying home goods and trinkets.

With fixed height shelves and smooth-pull drawers already built in, this two-door credenza is equipped to store anything, from your record collection to office supplies to the random bits that need a place to hide. It’s made from a combination of solid pine and engineered wood and is finished with a versatile herringbone-style front that can adapt to any interior design style. Plus, with a length of 62”, you can fit a TV on top if you want to use it in your media room.

Media console, TV stand, a place to line up the 10 cups you accumulate during the workday…we’re not going to tell you how to use this piece of living space furniture. But the step-up design is fun, and we love that. The natural wood grain and sleek black hardware is a nice touch, too.

Wade Logan Autumn-Lily 9-Piece Double Pedestal Dining Set $380 $190 Wayfair

It’s not rare to come across something pretty chic on Wayfair, and this dining room set checks the box. The upholstered seats are cozy and comfortable—lift up the cushion and you’ve got storage space under each stool. It gives conversation pit vibes (in spirit) and is highly versatile. Pull the pedestal seats up for dinner, or scatter them around the room for your next party.

Among the Wayfair Cyber Monday deals you’ll find a big selection of coffee tables and tv stands, like this simple, mid-century-inspired table from Mercury Row. The curved lines and abstract looks standout, but the top comes in different colors to help the table blend into whatever design style you are looking for.

Steelside Aichele Vegan Leather Wingback Chair $375 $200 Wayfair

As we nestle into the coziest time of year, consider where you’re going to curl up on the coldest days. This faux leather chair from Steelside is stylish enough to stand out but isn’t overbearing, meaning it could be the focal point of a room or simply do its duty as an accent chair. Add in your favorite new mystery novel, a wool blanket and some Earl Gray to really round out the wintry vibes and stay cozy until spring has sprung.

Pair your new armchair with a cozy, upholstered ottoman to make it the coziest duo in your home. Designed for reading, relaxing with Netflix after a long day, or to serve as an extra surface for throws and other necessities, it’s 38% off and also available in black.

If natural fibers are more your look, we get it. That’s where this 65% off jute option comes into play. It’s available in seven colorways if you want something that pops, but we’re partial to the un-dyed version pictured.

Harriet Bee Tena Solid Wood Standard Bunk Beds $1,675 $1,100 Wayfair

Bunk beds offer so much extra room for activities. We think this kid-friendly design with easy-to-manage stairs and plenty of storage is more than ideal for little ones sharing a room or for extra sleeping space in a guest room.

George Oliver Hermas 82.3'' Vegan Leather Sofa $1,020 $790 Wayfair

Storage isn’t always pretty, but it sure is in this case. Ideal for a small living room where every piece of furniture needs to double as storage space, this single-arm sofa is high on our list of Wayfair Cyber Monday sale deals. The chaise-style seat is hiding a pocket of storage underneath, while two drawers pull out to pack in even more space.

Mercury Row Henline Solid Wood Spindle Bed $905 $400 Wayfair

Made of solid wood, the slatted headboard on this frame is reminiscent of Shaker-style furniture and the curved shape gives off wingback vibes. It’s a lot of detail for a bed, but it doesn’t look like it’s trying too hard—and that’s hard to nail down.

Can you have too many throw pillows? The Edgar Throw is available in over 20 colors and comes with either a down or a polyfill insert. If you don’t need inserts, you can buy the pillow covers on their own and fill it yourself. Add one or two to accessorize your bedroom furniture or plop one down on each of your bar stools for a comfortable seat—regardless of where you use them, more pillows are always a good option. Plus, save an extra 25% with code TAKE25.

Yes, outdoor furniture is very much included in the Wayfair Cyber Monday sale! We love a classic Adirondack chair, but we also like this take on the design, which is made of a much more durable and weather-resistant material than regular wood.

Hayler 28" H x 36" W Wood Burning Outdoor Fire Pit Table With Lid $255 $140 Wayfair

While we are on the subject of outdoor furniture, here is another deal that should light your fire (pun intended). This wood burning fire pit doubles as an outdoor coffee table—when not in use, obviously—just pop the lid on it and serve drinks and snacks on your patio with ease. A firepit is a great investment year-round. Use it to extend your summer nights or keep yourself warm on winter afternoons. You can’t lose!

Wayfair Cyber Monday Deals: Kitchen Deals

Bake your heart out this holiday season with this powerful, high-volume stand mixer for Cuisinart. Tackle the biggest batches of cookies, whip up some ice cream or get your bread fix, all in record time.

All-Clad D5 Stainless Brushed Stainless Steel 5 Piece Cookware Set $680 $500 Wayfair

Anthony Bourdain always said that the only knife you need in the kitchen is a quality chef’s knife. The Global Knives Classic 8-inch Chef’s Knife fits the bill—especially at this price. Thanks to perfect balance and lightweight Cromova 18 stainless steel, you’ll no longer have to worry about hand fatigue. The steel is ice tempered and hardened, meaning it will keep its razor-sharp edge and resist rust and corrosion. Next thing you know, your julienne will be as good as any French sous-chef.

If you have the space (and not all of us do!) a foor processor is a kitchen tool you’ll find yourself using day after day. Use it for slicing, shredding and dicing whatever your heart desires. You can save $50 on the tool as we speak.

De'Longhi Dinamica Fully Automatic Coffee and Espresso Machine $1,430 $890 Wayfair

“This year, I’m going to stop buying $7 lattes.” We’ve all said it. But have we done it? Not likely. Make that resolution a reality next year by picking up this De’Longhi Dinamica espresso machine. The Dynamica boasts four brew modes: espresso, long espresso, drip-style coffee, and Over Ice. It has its own grinder, meaning you just drop the beans in and the machine does the rest. Next thing you know, you’ll be crafting barista-shaming oat milk lattes straight from your kitchen counter. Tiny fisherman beanie not included.

Maybe a full service espresso machine isn’t your ministry. This single serve pod coffee maker from Keurig is pretty much the opposite end of the spectrum as far as ease is concerned. It’s got nearly 6,000 positive reviews, is currently 53% off, and is available in six colorways to keep your countertop looking festive.

Affordable and easy on the eyes, this kettle from Bodum is ideal for making pour over coffee or brewing up some tea before bed. It holds 27 ounces of water, enough to make coffee for two (with some to spare) and will boil quickly thanks to a 1000-watt corded electric base. Once the water comes to a boil, auto shutoff turns the base off for you, avoiding overheating. </textarea>
