He starred for Argentina during their disrupted 1-0 win over Brazil this week

The veteran was instrumental in the World Cup final against France last year

One of Argentina's World Cup heroes has confirmed he will retire from international football at the end of next summer's Copa America.

The 35-year-old veteran helped Argentina lift the elusive World Cup trophy in Qatar last year, after his side narrowly won 4-2 on penalties against France at the end of an enthralling and dramatic final.

He took to Instagram on Thursday after starring for Argentina in their 1-0 win over arch-rivals Brazil, confirming he would hang up his boots in 2024.

Angel Di Maria, who scored in the World Cup final against France, accompanied the lengthy and heartfelt message to fans with a picture of him celebrating alongside his team-mates.

'Well, that was the last (World Cup) qualifying game for me,' he revealed at the start of the post.

The 35-year-old veteran revealed the news across social media on Thursday afternoon

After a emotional message to the fans, he added: 'The Copa America will be the last time I wear the Argentine shirt. With all the pain in my soul and with a knot in my throat, I will say goodbye to the most beautiful thing that has happened to me in my career. Dress it, sweat it and FEEL it with all the pride.

'Thank you fans, thank you family, thank you friends and team mates, we will keep making history and that will remain for eternity. Go Argentina!'

Di Maria, who returned to Portuguese outfit Benfica in the summer, gave no indication that he would be retiring from domestic football any time soon.

In his first nine appearances since his return Benfica, the winger has scored five goals, with his side top of the table in Portugal.

The Argentine's final World Cup qualifier was marred by chaos and mayhem in Brazil as fans began brawling with each other during the national anthems.

It led to police officers bludgeoning supporters with batons, forcing Lionel Messi to guide his countrymen to the shelter of the dressing room ahead of the delayed kick-off.

New footage surfaced on Thursday of Di Maria appearing to spit at Brazil fans after they showered him in beer by the Maracana tunnel.

Di Maria was retreating to the changing rooms with his Argentina team-mates as a result of the crowd trouble when he was doused in alcohol.

The video shows a streak of beer falling on to Di Maria's forehead before the footballer jumps up at the fan, who is out of shot, to spit in their direction.

Speaking of the mass brawl in his Instagram post, Di Maria said: 'Unfortunately we can't let go of the events that emerged in the stadium. No one deserves that bad treatment, not to mention the families and scared children in the middle of a stadium.

'Hopefully this type of stuff never happens again. We as players will always, always defend our people without any doubt.' </textarea>
