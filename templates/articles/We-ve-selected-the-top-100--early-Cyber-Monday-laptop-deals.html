UPDATE: Nov. 26, 2023, 8:00 a.m. EST This story has been updated with current pre-Cyber Monday pricing/availability and some new deals from Best Buy, Walmart, Lenovo, and Razer (including new top picks for the latter two).

The only thing better than a great laptop is a great laptop that's on sale. And whether you're after one of the powerful new Apple MacBook Pros, an upgraded gaming PC, or a basic Chromebook for schoolwork, you'll have no trouble finding one at a deep discount this Cyber Monday: We're seeing a slew of markdowns at tech retailers like Amazon and Best Buy. (The direct websites of brands like Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, Microsoft, and Razer are also packed to the gills with doorbusters, some of which match or beat their third-party rivals.)

Note: All newly added deals are marked with a ✨. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.

Early Cyber Monday laptop deals at Amazon

Why we like it

"[The new Surface Laptop Go 3] isn't a performance beast nor a battery-life champ," writes Mashable Tech Editor Kim Gedeon, "but it's ideal for students and busy-bee travelers in need of a portable notebook with one of the best keyboards I've ever tested." This is a new record-low price for the base configuration and a pretty significant discount for a laptop that came out only two months ago. We're excited to see it more firmly in "budget laptop" territory. (Note that Amazon had it listed as "temporarily out of stock" at the time of writing, but you could still order it and lock in the deal — you won't be charged until it ships.)

Early Cyber Monday laptop deals at Best Buy

Why we like it

Announced in late October at Apple's "Scary Fast" event, this new 14-inch MacBook Pro killed off the company's 13-inch model (and its little Touch Bar, too) with an M3 chip that's said to offer 60 percent faster performance. It also has a new record-low price for Cyber Weekend: Paid members of the My Best Buy program can snag it for $200 off. (Non-member plebeians will pay $50 more, which is still a pretty sweet deal considering how new it is.)

Early Cyber Monday laptop deals at Walmart

Why we like it

Walmart's pre-Cyber Monday laptop deals are pretty sparse, but this is a solid discount on a 14-inch convertible model from HP's midrange Pavilion line; it's actually gotten $50 cheaper since it first went on sale during the big-box store's Black Friday deals event. It comes with a 12th-generation Intel Core i5 processor with 8GB of memory, 256GB of storage, up to 11.75 hours of battery life, and a micro-edge 1080p touchscreen display — some nice specs for entertainment and everyday productivity.

The 15-inch Dell XPS is Mashable's favorite Windows laptop, boasting a premium build with a stunning edge-to-edge display and powerful specs that rival some desktops. This particular model has a 13th-gen Intel Core i7 H-series processor with 16GB of RAM, Intel Arc A370M graphics, and 512TB of storage, and it's sitting at its lowest price to date — a whopping 27% off.
