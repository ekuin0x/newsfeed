                <textarea id="text" readonly> TUSCALOOSA, Ala. – Alabama volleyball gave No. 24 Auburn all it could handle over four sets Sunday afternoon at Foster Auditorium, with the teams splitting the first two frames before the Tigers won a pair of close ones to take the match in four.

Alabama (10-12, 0-11 SEC) fell in the opening set to Auburn (17-5, 7-4 SEC), 18-25, but surged ahead after a back-and-forth start to the second to take the lead at 19-18 and hold it the rest of the way en route to a 25-22 victory to even the match. The Tide trailed 16-9 in set three and came all the way back to lead 21-19 late in the set. Tied at 23-23, the Tigers scored back-to-back points to take the narrow two-point victory and 2-1 match lead. Neither team led by more than three points in the fourth set with the score tied 13 times. At 22-22, an Alabama service error gave Auburn the ball and the lead and the visitors finished out the match with a pair of kills to win, 25-22.

Chaise Campbell tied for the team lead with 10 kills alongside Jordyn Towns and Kaleigh Palmer , a season-high total for both freshmen. Campbell also led the net defense with seven blocks, just one shy of her career best set earlier this season. Vic Schmer tied her season high with 17 digs while Callie Kieffer earned her sixth double-double of the season with 37 assists and 11 digs.

From Head Coach Rashinda Reed

"I'm incredibly proud of this team. Both teams battled out there and we got a step closer to our goals with how we want to perform as a team. There are so many small nuances within the game that played into today's performance. These ladies are competitors, the freshmen are stepping up and the upperclassmen are leading. Seeing that growth happen with every match is awesome."
