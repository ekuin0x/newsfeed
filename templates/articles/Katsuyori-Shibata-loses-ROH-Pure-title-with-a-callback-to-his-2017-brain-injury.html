                <textarea id="text" readonly> The ROH Pure championship changed hands in the main event of tonight’s (Nov. 25) episode of Rampage when Wheeler Yuta cheated to defeat Katsuyori Shibata.

Earlier in the night, Wheeler cut a promo explaining that he’s a little prick who will exploit Shibata’s 2017 brain injury in order win back the Pure title. The commentators later reminded viewers that Shibata nearly died in 2017 from a brain injury after wrestling Kazuchika Okada. Shibata collapsed after that match and was taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a subdural hematoma.

Shibata was never supposed to wrestle again, but he’s become a fixture for ROH this year as its Pure champion. However, his reign came to an end tonight when Wheeler blasted him a low blow and planted his head on the mat:

Shibata was understandably incredulous about Yuta’s handshake offer after the match, so Wheeler hit him with another low blow and dropped his head on the mat again. That’s when FTW Champion HOOK came out for the save.

Shibata seemed to be walking off okay as the show was coming to a close, but then he dropped down to his knees and was holding his head in pain. The commentators immediately noted that Shibata was not okay and “this is exactly what happened in 2017.”

What are your thoughts on the finish of this match, Cagesiders? </textarea>
