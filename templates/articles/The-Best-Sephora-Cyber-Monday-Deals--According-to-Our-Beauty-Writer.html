I always turn to Sephora for my beauty needs, whether I’m browsing buzzy new brands or my new favorite, the Sephora Collection corner. I typically wait for their sales events to stock up on my wish-list items, and over the years of shopping at the retailer, I’ve learned that its Cyber Monday deals are actually very good.

Sephora is offering deep discounts on brands that run the gamut from Make Up For Ever to Youth to the People. On top of that, they’re offering more sales on our favorite hair products (like a convenient convertible hair tool) and giftable fragrances (in perfume sample set and candle form). As I sifted through the deals, I made sure to prioritize things that Strategist writers, dermatologists, makeup artists, and other experts have vetted themselves. I also added in some of my personal favorites below, like my go-to shimmery lip gloss that’s similar to Dior’s Lip Glow Oil. To make shopping even easier, you can use the table of contents to jump right to exactly what you’re looking for.

I’m done checking this post for the day. You can still shop any of the deals below, but just know that prices and stock are subject to change. For even more discounts and holiday shopping updates (beauty and otherwise), sign up for our newsletter and check out our gift-guide coverage.

Skin care

Fresh Soy Face Cleanser $27 $39 now 31% off $27 Fresh’s soy cleanser — now 30 percent off — is perfect for extra-sensitive skin. It gently cleanses while also leaving your skin “toned and brightened.” $27 at Sephora Buy

NuFACE FIX Set $124 $165 now 25% off $124 This NuFace device offers more targeted results than larger versions. It’s said to reduce fine lines and wrinkles around the eyes, lips, and forehead $124 at Sephora Buy

NuFACE Hydrating Aqua Gel $41 $55 now 25% off $41 If you’re already a NuFace user, you might want to stock up the brand’s activator gel while it’s on sale. $41 at Sephora Buy

Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm $27 $38 now 29% off $27 If you prefer a balm over a liquid formula, the brand’s makeup melting cleansing balm is also on sale in all three sizes. $27 at Sephora Buy

Clinique Glowing Skin Must-Haves Skincare Set $33 $48 now 31% off $33 This set — complete with a mini of the balm above, a moisturizer, and an overnight hydrating mask — is also 30 percent off. $33 at Sephora Buy

Topicals Like Butter Hydrating Mask $27 $34 now 21% off $27 Also on sale from the brand is their hydrating moisturizer meant to soothe and calm redness, itch, and sensitivities of eczema-prone skin. $27 at Sephora Buy

Makeup

Milk Makeup Sunshine Skin Tint Clean SPF 30 Foundation $21 $42 now 50% off $21 ﻿We love this super sheer skin tint from Milk Makeup for subtle coverage and a dewy glow. Plus, it’s good for acne-prone and dry skin and protects from UV rays. $21 at Sephora Buy

Tom Ford Traceless Soft Matte Foundation $45 $90 now 50% off $45 And, another 50 percent off for those who prefer a liquid formula. Shades have already sold out, so make sure to act fast. $45 at Sephora Buy

Sephora Collection Sephora Colorful® Lip Gloss Balm $5 $10 now 50% off $5 A new favorite of mine is Sephora Collection’s shimmery lip gloss. I have Cinnamon Toast (which I think is pretty similar to Dior Lip Glow Oil in rosewood) and plan on stocking up since all 30 shades are just $5. $5 at Sephora Buy

Clinique Almost Lipstick $17 $23 now 27% off $17 This looks-good-on-everyone lipstick “stains the lip a shade or two darker than nothing, it’s not waxy, and when it fades you’re never left in that weird, half-on phase that can lead to the impression that you’re a little bit drunk.” $17 at Sephora Buy

Anastasia Beverly Hills Strong Hold Clear Brow Gel $11 $22 now 50% off $11 Hailee Steinfeld told us this brow gel is a “lifesaver” for her unpredictable brows. “I put it on in the morning and I’m good all day. It doesn’t get flaky. It doesn’t get funky after a couple hours,” she says. And right now, you can get it at a drugstore price. $11 at Sephora Buy

Urban Decay Naked3 Eyeshadow Palette $59 now 50% off $30 If your eyeshadow palette’s in need of a refresh, Urban Decay’s Naked palettes are a longtime favorite of mine. The range of neutrals work for day and night looks. $30 at Sephora Buy

Lilly Lashes Everyday Faux Mink Lashes $10 $20 now 50% off $10 These lashes were recommended to me by Sephora employees last Halloween, and I love them for more dramatic eye looks. All four styles are available at drugstore prices. $10 at Sephora Buy

Hair care

Olaplex No. 4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo $21 $30 now 30% off $21 Olaplex, known for reviving damaged hair, is taking 30 percent off several products in its lineup. Its shampoo is our favorite for color-treated hair because it “repairs protein bonds in hair, limits split ends and subsequent hair breakage, and helps keep hair smooth and frizz free.” $21 at Sephora Buy

Olaplex No.7 Bonding Oil $21 $30 now 30% off $21 Its hair oil protects against heat damage up to 450 degrees and can be used on wet or dry hair. It also helps minimize flyaways and frizz but is incredibly lightweight. $21 at Sephora Buy

T3 Featherweight StyleMax $150 $200 now 25% off $150 The brand’s hair dryer is our favorite for styling. It has “settings for hair texture (fine, medium, coarse), as well as styling type (rough dry, smooth, diffuse, volume)” making it simple to achieve your styling goals. $150 at Sephora Buy

Dyson Airwrap Multi-Styler Complete Long $499 $599 now 17% off $499 Maybe controversial, but I think the Dyson Airwrap is worth its high price. It’s saved me money and time at the salon, since I can easily create expensive-looking blowout looks at home. And today, it’s $100 cheaper. $499 at Sephora Buy

Fragrance

Maison Louis Marie Antidris Cassis Perfume Oil $49 $65 now 25% off $49 Beverly Nguyen told us this calming fragrance — now just $49 — has been her favorite for a decade. “I remember picking it up and it was like, I am obsessed with the smell,” she says. “I put it on and I knew, and it’s been with me ever since.” $49 at Sephora Buy

Alien Goddess by Mugler Eau de Parfum $90 $150 now 40% off $90 Former Strategist deals writer Leah Muncy described Mugler’s Alien Goddess as a “more mature, complex version of Juicy Couture’s Viva La Juicy, with floral notes of bergamot, vanilla, and jasmine.” $90 at Sephora Buy
