                <textarea id="text" readonly> However, a flurry of regulatory activity before Thanksgiving left investors wary. The SEC v Kraken case and the Binance penalty suggest a new wave of regulation by enforcement. On Friday, the CFTC joined the SEC and the US Department of Justice in a targeted approach to the US digital asset space.

CFTC Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero made the headlines, saying,

“There are no pirate ships in US markets. […] Access to US customers is a privilege, not a right.”

CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham also issued a warning, saying,

“It should be crystal clear that the CFTC will not stop in its pursuit of non-US entities.”

Earlier this week, Commissioner Pham shared her statement on the CFTC making its first case against a crypto compliance officer. The statement highlighted previous SEC individual liability cases and quoted SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, saying,

“The SEC’s determinations about whether to charge a compliance officer are consequential, not only for the particular compliance officer but more generally for the profession.”

Discussing the charges against the Binance Chief Compliance Officer, Pham added,

“I believe that the alleged facts involving egregious personal conduct demonstrate that the defendant employee was compliance in name only. I also believe that these charges emphasize the critical necessity of having a robust compliance program that is adequately resourced with personnel that have the requisite character, expertise, and experience. I support sending this strong message to the crypto asset sector […]. “

The CFTC warnings expose the crypto market to more regulatory-by-enforcement shocks.
