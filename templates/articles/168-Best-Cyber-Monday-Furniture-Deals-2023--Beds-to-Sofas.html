She found the perfect fit in the ultra customizable Uncle Sal sectional sofa. “It’s soft and hasn’t caught on any untrimmed claws thus far,” she said of the sofa's performance fabric. “Our dogs play rough and don’t go easy on furniture so I’ve been particularly impressed with its durability.” Right now, Benchmade is offering 20% off sitewide.

It’s obvious that this is a high-quality product.”

The nice thing about Lovesac sactionals is that you can buy additional sections, so adding more would be fairly easy.”

Bedroom & Bath Cyber Monday Deals

There’s something you should probably know about us: we love sleep. So much so that we've tested upwards of 30 mattresses and sleep-related products, all in the name of making sure you have recommendations you can rely on. Much like furniture, Black Friday is the time to invest in a mattress at a discounted price if you're looking to enter 2024 with a new sleep setup. A few of our favorites are below and we’re seeing some of the lowest prices on in stock items that we’ve seen all year.

Saatva’s Black Friday sale is here, offering up to $600 off sitewide–including the Saatva Classic and Clever contributor Bailey Berg’s favorite Loom & Leaf memory foam mattress. “Both my boyfriend and I are light sleepers: If one of us rolls over, the other one generally wakes up too,” Bailey says. “After the first couple nights, I realized I hadn’t been woken up by his movements (or by our dogs jumping on and off the bed) at all. The memory foam, it turns out, does a great job of isolating motion. And the brand wasn’t kidding when it said you’d feel buoyant. I’m a stomach and back sleeper, whereas he’s a strict side sleeper, and we both mentioned feeling like it was the perfect amount of support to relieve pressure.”

The Nectar mattress received the top mattress award in our Sleep Awards earlier this year and their Black Friday mattress sale is here. Save up to 50% off everything, with mattresses starting at just $359 and adjustable-base frames at 50% off.

Happsy’s Organic Mattress is an excellent eco-friendly option thanks to 100% organic and non-toxic materials, including wool, cotton, certified latex and pocketed springs. They also offers a generous 20-year warranty and a 120-night trial. Through 12/4, save 25% sitewide by using code ARCHDIGEST25 at checkout. This means saving on the Happsy mattress, topper, mattress protector, sheet set and more. Our contributor Kristi Kellogg had a great time trying out the Happsy mattress for our mattress-in-a-box testing “The mattress is firm and solid,” Kristi said. “It’s just as firm as a regular coiled mattress. I like my mattresses extremely firm (otherwise I get back pain), and this one lived up to my standards.”

Is there a duo more foundational than the mattress and bed frame? We think not. If you're in the market for a new setup, head over to Casper where you can save 30% on all of the brand's mattresses and 25% off everything else. And, because they outfit your whole bedroom, you can buy a mattress, a frame, a set of sheets and a pillow all in one go!

Expect mattress deals and more through January 8—a new sleep situation is the best way to kick off the new year, after all. Everything is 10% off with the secret code: HOLIDAY. Commerce producer Katarina Kovac loved sleeping on the Avocado mattress, “I could not be happier knowing that I now sleep on a 100% organic mattress that is not only ethical in its materials but also its production,” Kat said. “Knowing that I’m not breathing in toxic chemicals when I lay my head at night is huge. The wool fabric was super warm and soft to the touch, and my sheets fit on it perfectly.”

It’s probably time to refresh your bed—make sure to do so before 12/6, when Serta is offering hundreds off of their stock. What’s included? Up to $1,000 off the Serta Arctic, $600 off Arctic Mattresses and up to $400 off the Motion Perfect IV Base, and up to $900 off on the iComfortECO.

In addition, shoppers can take advantage of 10% off furniture; 15% off pillows, protectors, toppers, duvet inserts, and percale bedding; 20% off hemp bedding; and 25% off organic jersey bedding, quilts, throws, and dog beds. Curious about the Mint mattress? Our contributor Anna Fixsen had a positive time with it. “I would rate it a 9 out of 10!” Anna said. “The Mint mattress provides a luxuriously supportive sleep. I am usually a big toss-and-turner, but I slept noticeably better in this bed than on my previous mattress. I found that I could find my comfy place quickly and fall asleep faster.”

There are lots of ways to save at Beautyrest right now. Between 11/13 and 12/5, get up to $900 off the Beautyrest Black and Black Hybrid, $700 of K-Class, $600 off C-Class, $300 off L-Class and B-Class, $200 off Black Luxury, and up to $500 off the Harmony Lux and Harmony Luxe Hybrid.

Brooklinen makes some of our favorite sheets and duvet covers. Right now, you can shop the Black Friday sale and get 20% off bestsellers like the Classic Percale Core Set and the Washed Linen Duvet Set as well as the Clever-approved faves below. As AD PRO editor Mel Studach put in her review of the Brooklinen Classic duvet cover, “I’m not particularly picky when it comes to my duvet cover material—percale, linen, and sateen each have their perfect setting—but this Classic duvet cover has tipped the scales for me! I love how crisp and smooth the percale is—in both appearance and touch. And inserting the duvet was simple with help from the cover’s “long” and “short” interior tags.”

The Parachute Black Friday sale is one of the best we've seen so far. They’ve dropped prices on many of our favorites, including a cozy quilt, waffle booties and linen bedding.

If you want to try the bedding brand beloved by Oprah and commerce editor Audrey Lee, consider this your chance to do it at a discount. Right now you get can up to 40% off all sheets and up to 35% off everything else for Cozy Earth’s Cyber Week sale. Here’s what else Audrey had to say about her experience with the Cozy Earth bamboo sheet set: “Sleeping on these sheets felt like being draped in a luxuriously lightweight silk that often had me wishing I didn’t have to get out of bed in the morning. At first, I immediately noticed how next-level soft the bamboo viscose fabric was and how nicely the fitted sheet clung my bed. Though it still has a nice weight to it, the fabric is thin enough to allow air to pass easily through the layer and keep me comfortable all night long.”

You might want to stock up on new bedding before temperatures start to dip come winter. Thankfully, Crane & Canopy is offering 20% off sitewide. That includes their luxury bath towels, shower curtains, classic countertop accessories, and more through 11/28 with the code YAYA23.

Pom Pom at Home—who makes some of our favorite bamboo sheets—is offering 30% off discount sitewide through November 30 with the code BF3030. While you're at it, throw a wooly throw blanket (pun intended) into the mix. According to our reviewer, design editor Sydney Gore, the sheets can’t be beat: “Compared to some of the other sustainable bedding brands that I’ve tried in the past, Pom Pom at Home doesn’t compromise quality or integrity in presenting itself as a luxury brand. My hibernation mode was fully activated and I found it very difficult to leave my bed every morning. Color me impressed!”

Zinus, maker of everyone's favorite affordable bed frames, is offering up to 50% off select items from November 24 to December 2 with code BFCW20. Not only is the Linda Wood Platform Bed Frame a breeze to put together, it's great looking and, according to our reviewer, “sturdy as a rock.” Here’s what else senior commerce editor Rachel Fletcher had to say about this already affordable bed frame: “For the price, I truly don’t think the quality can be beat. And the style of the Linda is pretty agnostic—it’s a little midcentury, a little Scandinavian—so much so that I can imagine it fitting into a host of home decor aesthetics, from a cozy cabin to something more minimalist or beachy or boho! With the Linda, the decor world is your oyster.”

Zinus Linda Wood Platform Bed Frame $539 $431 Zinus

Naked Cashmere's 50% off sitewide sale for Cyber Week is a very dreamy bargain. Personally, we think an ultra luxurious pajama set is a worthwhile investment, either for yourself to enjoy or to gift to a very deserving loved one.

If you're looking for a stylish new quilt or some high-quality bedding, you'll want to stop by the Company Store's site. For Cyber Monday, the retailer is offering up to 35% off almost everything (excluding new arrivals) with code CYBER22 through 11/28. Our reviewer Katie Leirey tested the Company Store‘s satten comforter and said she was “pleasantly surprised sleeping with this comforter!” She continues, “I was skeptical since I’m a hot sleeper and it is specifically highlighted that this comforter is great for cold sleepers. I have actually found it to be overall lightweight without sacrificing warmth. The fabric feels really smooth and luxurious while also feeling durable—you can feel the quality.”

Material has a less-is-more philosophy when it comes to the kitchen, and doubles down on the essentials. The brand has identified and perfected the can’t-live-without-them tools that every home cook needs in their kitchen, and has focused all its efforts on getting them right.

During Black Friday, you can save up to 25% sitewide, meaning now is your chance to stock up on Material’s honed-to-perfection kitchenware.
