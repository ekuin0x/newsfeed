Prince William and Kate Middleton’s children Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis have part-time nanny. Unlike many royals before, the Prince and Princess of Wales hired only one part-time nanny named Maria Borrallo, who they hired in 2014 when George was just eight months old.

While reports have come in about Borrallo’s strict background that limits fussy eating habits, and more, but the latest alleged rule she has to follow for the Wales’s children is one many might not even think about.

LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM – JUNE 17: (EMBARGOED FOR PUBLICATION IN UK NEWSPAPERS UNTIL 48 HOURS AFTER CREATE DATE AND TIME) Prince George of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, accompanied by their nanny Maria Teresa Borrallo, watch from a window of Buckingham Palace during the annual Trooping the Colour Parade on June 17, 2017 in London, England. Trooping the Colour is a military parade to mark Queen Elizabeth II’s official birthday and dates back to the time of Charles II in the 17th Century when the Colours of a Regiment were used as a rallying point in battle.

Nanny in a Book author and historian Louise Heren says Borrallo’s strict training from Norland College reportedly taught her to avoid the word “kids” at all times. “The word ‘kid’ is banned,” she said to The Mirror via Express, referring to how Borrallo must say the word “children” instead. “It’s a mark of respect for the children as individuals.”

Other alleged rules include a strict 7 pm bedtime, no yelling, and learning new things through games rather than screen time.

William and Kate share three children named George, 9, Charlotte, 8, and Louis, 5.
