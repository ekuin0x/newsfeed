A UK dentist is warning that unsightly gaps that appear as black triangles near the gum line could indicate oral hygiene concerns.

“They can trap food particles and impact oral hygiene and aesthetics, which may warrant dental attention for cosmetic or preventive reasons,” Dr. Abdul Azizi, principal dentist at Harley Private Dental in England, recently told Express.

The so-called “black triangle teeth” — a condition known as gingival embrasures — can be caused by gum recession, large toothbrush use, aggressive brushing, narrow front teeth, bone loss or faulty orthodontic treatment, according to California orthodontist Dr. Brian Thurman.

“It is essential to fix these black triangles for cosmetic reasons and dental well-being,” he wrote on his blog in 2021. “They not only ruin your smile, but they also provide space for bacteria to grow in your teeth.”

Thurman advised flossing gently, using a soft bristle toothbrush — and replacing it every three or four months, before it frays — in addition to adopting habits that can ward off gum disease.

“Smoking increases the risk of gum disease and hampers the body’s ability to heal damaged gums. Quitting smoking promotes healthy gums and reduces the chances of black triangles,” he added.

“A balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management contribute to overall gum health and decrease the likelihood of black triangles,” Thurman continued. “The good news is there are many treatment options available to treat gingival embrasures. Your dentist is the right person to suggest the appropriate treatment in your case.”
