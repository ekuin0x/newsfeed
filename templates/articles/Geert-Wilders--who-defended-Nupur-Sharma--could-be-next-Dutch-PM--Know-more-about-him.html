                <textarea id="text" readonly> Far-right populist Geert Wilders could be Netherlands's first far-right prime minister after his party secured a massive number of seats in the recently held Dutch elections. Leader of the Party for Freedom (PVV) Geert Wilders waves as he arrives at a post-election meeting at the Nieuwspoort conference center in The Hague on November 23, 2023. (AFP)

With nearly all votes counted, Wilders' party was forecast to win 37 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament, more than double the 17 the party secured in the last election, according to AFP.

The ruling left-wing alliance under ex-EU commissioner Frans Timmermans is second with 25 seats, followed by the center-right VVD with 24.

Wilders will now have to persuade other parties to join him in a coalition. His target is 76 seats in the 150-seat parliament, according to the BBC.

A known anti-Islam populist leader, Wilder further told the British broadcaster that he was willing to negotiate and compromise with other parties to become prime minister.

“It is going to happen that the PVV is in the next Cabinet,” said while meeting members of his party. “Can you imagine it? 37 seats!”
