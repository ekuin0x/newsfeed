                <textarea id="text" readonly> I ordered from Portillo's for the first time since I was a kid to see if it was still as good.

The Chicago-style hot dog definitely holds up, and I'm glad a saved some room for a shake.

I think the nostalgic chain lives up to the hype, and I'm definitely going back soon.

Portillo's, one of Chicago's most popular hot-dog chains, has been proudly serving diner-style fare for decades.

The chain currently has 76 locations across the Midwest, West Coast, and South in the US.

I loved Portillo's as a kid, but I haven't eaten it in years, so I wanted to see if it still lived up to the hype. </textarea>
