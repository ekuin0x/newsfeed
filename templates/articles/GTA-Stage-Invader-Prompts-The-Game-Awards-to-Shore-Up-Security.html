                <textarea id="text" readonly> Both at The Game Awards last year and at Gamescom Opening Night Live earlier this year, there have been stage invaders interrupting the Geoff Keighley hosted events. While these can be eyebrow raising moments at the best of times, they genuinely raise legitimate questions about the safety of those people on stage.

Obviously, it’s something the organiser is taking extremely seriously. “We don’t want to talk about that stuff too publicly, just because it’s security,” said Keighley during a Q&A. “We definitely have plans and we’re trying to do all we can to keep me safe, but also everyone watching the show, the audience, people participating in the show, and everything. It’s certainly something we’re thinking about. We appreciate the concern.”

He continued: “Believe me, that’s something that is top of mind for us, but we also want to put on a great show that celebrates these games, and celebrates our love of video games, so that’s an important thing to keep in mind as well. But yeah, I appreciate the concern around that.”

As alluded to above, there have been a couple of bizarre moments during these livestreams recently. It started last year when a heckler joined FromSoftware on stage to collect the Game of the Year award, before subsequently chanting about Bill Clinton. A similar thing occurred earlier this year during Gamescom Opening Night Live, when an invader ran on stage to declare “Bill Clinton wants GTA 6”.

This sort of thing understandably can’t be happening, so hopefully Keighley’s got everything under control this year. </textarea>
