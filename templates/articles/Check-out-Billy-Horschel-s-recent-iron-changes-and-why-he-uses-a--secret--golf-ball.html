                <textarea id="text" readonly> “What we were trying to do is match certain things that Billy was doing really well with his driver, where he had kind of a certain build type and a swing weight that he was really liking feeling the head,” Van Wezenbeeck said on Tuesday at The RSM Classic. “When we look at the total mass of the golf club, we have to look at where we remove and where we add weight. He was a player that had used the same iron shaft (True Temper Dynamic Gold Tour Issue X100) for a long time. We liked certain parts of that performance, but we were trying to get him to deliver the loft more consistently. </textarea>
