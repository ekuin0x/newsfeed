The home chef or budding cook in your life may appreciate some new tech to smarten up their kitchens. You might even be looking for kitchen gadgets that will make it easier to prepare a holiday feast — and make next year’s meal prep simpler too. Whether for gifts or for yourself, Black Friday is an ideal time to save on kitchen tech and smart appliances. Many of our tested and recommended cookers, air fryers, pizza ovens and other tools are on sale right now, and many are dropping to the best prices we’ve seen all year.

Instant Pot Duo Plus

The Instant Pot Duo is 47 percent off and down to $70 at Amazon. which beats its previous all-time low from Prime Day in July. It's $10 more directly from Instant Brands. This is our favorite multi-cooker (and we’re not alone) with the ability to make everything from yogurt to rice to full dinners and desserts. The Duo model is simple to get the hang of and has plenty of quick cooking modes for a range of dishes — eggs and grains included — and even has a sous vide mode. If you know someone who doesn’t have an Instant Pot yet, this will make a great gift.

Vitamix Explorian Series E310

The Vitamix E310 is on sale for $289 at Amazon, Target and directly from Vitamix, and while that’s not an all-time low, it’s still a $60 discount on a particularly powerful blender. It’s our favorite blender from our guide to kitchen tech because it goes beyond smoothie duty to create salsas, sauces, dips and even soups (which the blender can heat to steaming in the container due to shear friction). Anyone coming from a standard blender will be impressed with the way it renders even the hardest, chunkiest ingredients silky smooth.

Instant Vortex Plus air fryer

The company that makes our favorite multi-cooker also makes our favorite air fryer. The Instant Vortex Plus air fryer is down to $80 at Amazon, which matches its lowest price ever, from back in October for Amazon’s Prime Day. This is a good pick even for air frying newbies as the controls are intuitive and the basket is easy to clean. This new model adds a viewing window to peek in on your food and an odor-removing filter. While it didn’t completely eliminate the odors in our tests, it definitely smelled less smokey than other units we tried.

KitchenAid Artisan Stand Mixer

KitchenAid’s Artisan series stand mixer is $100 off the $450 MSRP. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen gear because it's durable, powerful and it comes with a beater, dough hook and wire whisk attachments. KitchenAid mixers are also compatible with a variety of accessories and attachments that can turn the machine into an ice cream maker, a meat grinder or even a pasta machine, which will quickly expand your cooking repertoire.

Anova Precision Cooker 3.0

Anova Precision Sous Vide machine is down to $145 after a 27 percent discount at Amazon and Target. That’s not an all time low, but still the lowest price it’s sold for in the past few months. This is our top sous vide pick in our kitchen tech guide thanks to the helpful app with hundreds of recipes and the option for remote control. If you or your giftee are more hands-on chefs, there are manual controls too. This newer generation includes digital touch controls and a longer cord than last time, as well as Wi-Fi connectivity.

Breville Pizzaiolo

The Breville Pizzaiolo is 20 percent off at Amazon, Williams Sonoma and directly from Breville, bringing the pricey $1,000 machine down to $800 — a price it has hit during previous shopping holidays. That’s still not cheap, but if you’re looking for a dedicated pizza oven that cooks 12-inch pies remarkably well, this is a solid pick. It’s one of the indoor options from our guide to the best ‘za cookers and offers different presets, including a “wood fired” setting. The heating elements adjust and adapt thanks to the smarts inside, creating an ideal environment for whatever style you’ve selected. For real pros, the Pizzaiolo also includes a manual mode that lets you dial in your temps for the upper and lower elements.

Solo Stove Pi Pizza Oven

If we extend the concept of the kitchen to include anywhere food is made, outdoor pizza ovens most definitely belong on this list. The You might know Solo Stove for its fire pits, but we found them to make some pretty great pizza ovens too. Solo stove is having a sitewide sale for Black Friday, which includes discounts on the wood only or dual fuel Solo Stove Pi Pizza Oven and the gas-only Pi Prime, which is $50 off and currently offered with a 20 percent off promo for Amazon Prime members.

KitchenAid Cordless variable speed hand blender

We like KitchenAid’s Cordless Variable Speed Blender because its easy to use and has an 180-watt motor that you can adjust just by how much you squeeze the trigger. It also comes with a dishwasher-safe blending jar and an optional pan guard so you don't scratch your cookware. The built-in safety switch makes it harder to start up the blade by accident for extra peace of mind as you cook. Right now it's $20 off at Amazon and directly from KitchenAid.

OXO Good Grips Precision scale

OXO’s Precision Scale is on sale for $45, which is 15 percent off the list price and about $7 cheaper than it’s been selling for these past few months. It’s an ideal gift for a baker, as measuring by weight tends to produce far better results than volumetric measurements. It supports both metric and imperial weights in precise, 0.1-gram increments and even has a timer built-in, because you just can’t have too many of those in the kitchen. Plus the minimalist design looks good on any countertop.

SodaStream Terra

The SodaStream Terra is already the company’s most affordable soda maker, and for Black Friday at Amazon and at SodaStream, it’s down to $60 — a price it hasn’t hit since last year’s holiday sales. The kit includes a reusable one liter bottle, a bottle of Bubbly Drop lemon lime flavor, and a CO2 cylinder, along with the device itself. It doesn’t need to be plugged in, just attach the cartridge, fill the bottle with water and hit the button to make the bubbles. Then you can mix and match whichever flavors you want, while feeling good about saving money, packaging and transportation waste from traditional sodas.

Fellow Tally Pro Precision Scale

Our biggest concern when we tried out the Tally Pro scale was the price. Now Black Friday is making the $185 gadget a little easier to take, with a 20 percent discount that brings it down to $148, which looks to be its lowest price yet. It’s perfect for anyone who’s really into brewing the perfect cup of coffee. The scale calculates the amount of water you need and tells you how much water to add throughout the brewing time for the best extraction.

Fellow Stagg EKG Pro kettle

Fellow’s Stagg EKG Pro Electric Kettle is also on sale, with a 20 percent discount bringing it down to $204 instead of $255. It’s a fully featured pour-over kettle that lets you pick preset temperatures for different brews of coffee and tea. There’s also a manual mode for the more experienced. You can set your altitude, schedule the pot to start warming up at a specific time and use the hold mode to maintain the temp for up to an hour.

Fellow Opus Conical Burr Grinder

With a good scale and good kettle, you may also want a good grinder. Fellow’s Opus Conical Burr Grinder and the Ode Brew Grinder Gen 2 are both 20 percent off as well, bringinght them down to $156 and $276, respectively. The Opus has more than 40 precision settings and 40mm conical burrs with a burr speed of 350 RPM. The Ode Gen 2 has 31 grind settings and is built to run a little quieter. It has an auto-stop function, along with anti-static tech that's said to reduce grind mess.

Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro

The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro is beastly enough to replace your oven, and might even be overkill for some. It’s our favorite multi-purpose air fryer because it can bake, dehydrate, slow cook and convect in addition to making things crispy with its air frying capabilities. Right now Amazon, Best Buy and Breville’s storefront are selling the unit for $320, and though that’s not an all-time low, it’s still about $80 less than it typically sells for and $130 off the list price.

Thermapen One

The Thermapen One is our favorite thermometer because it gives accurate readings nearly instantly and has an auto-rotating screen that’s easy to read. It’s on sale from Thermoworks for $71 instead of the list price of $109 and even cheaper than the $99 it often sells for.
