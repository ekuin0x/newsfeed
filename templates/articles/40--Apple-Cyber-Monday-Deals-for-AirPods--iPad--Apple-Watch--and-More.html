Our Cyber Monday Guides

HomePod

HomePod (2nd Gen)

B&H Photo has been the only retailer with a consistent discount on Apple's second generation HomePod. Right now, you can get it in both colors for $279.99, down from $299.00. While not a huge markdown, this continues to be the best price we've ever tracked.

AirPods

AirPods 2

We originally tracked the AirPods 2 for $69.00 at Amazon in early November, but that sale quickly expired. For now, you can get the AirPods 2 for $79.99, down from $129.00. This version of the AirPods is perfect for anyone on your holiday shopping list who may be asking for a simple and reliable pair of wireless earbuds, particularly at this insanely low price tag.

AirPods 3

Amazon has the AirPods 3 with Lightning Charging Case for $139.99, down from $169.00. These are upgraded in a few ways from the AirPods 2, with spatial audio, Adaptive EQ, force sensor controls, sweat and water resistance, and more.

AirPods Pro 2

Moving to the Pro lineup, Amazon has the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) at their all-time low price of $189.99.

AirPods Max

Lastly, the high-end AirPods Max are available for $449.99 on Amazon, down from $549.00. Discounts on the AirPods Max have been rare over the past few months, so this one is a second-best price on the over-ear headphones.

iPhone

AT&T

AT&T quite a few sales and offers for multiple iPhone 15 devices, including up to $1,000 off the iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max with an eligible smartphone trade-in. Models with lower storage capacities can be purchased at no cost thanks to these discounts, and of course you'll need to purchase the new smartphone on a qualifying installment agreement.

You can get up to $830 off the iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Plus as well, with the same stipulations as the Pro devices. Both offers will be delivered via monthly bill credits, starting within three bills after trade-in is completed. It'll be applied in equal amounts over the term of your installment agreement.

For the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max offer, you'll need to trade in a device with a value of $230 or higher to get the full $1,000 off markdown. You'll get up to $830 in bill credits with a trade-in value of $130 to $229 and up to $350 in bill credits with a trade-in value of $35 to $129.

For older iPhone models, AT&T is offering the 128GB iPhone 14 at $10.99/month with no trade-in required. Similarly, the iPhone 14 Pro is available at $15/month with no trade-in required. For these, all you'll need is to purchase the smartphones on an installment plan and pick or upgrade to an eligible unlimited plan.

AT&T is also taking $300 off any Apple Watch when you purchase two at the same time. Like smartphone plans, you'll have to buy two Apple Watches on an installment plan, add at least one new line, and activate both on your wireless plan. Afterwards, you'll get up to $300 in bill credits over 36 months.

Verizon

At Verizon, you can get a special bundle offer if you're interested in purchasing the new iPhone 15 Pro this holiday season. When you do pick up the new smartphone with a new line on an Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan, Verizon will reward you with an Apple TV 4K (64GB) and six months of Apple One at no cost.

Of course, you can purchase higher storage iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max models, but at that point you'll be paying a little extra. The Apple TV 4K promotion requires a smarpthone purchase on an eligible plan and ends on November 15, while the Apple One six month promotion requires a line subscribed to an Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan.

For last year's models, you can get four iPhone 14 Plus devices for free along with four lines on Unlimited Welcome at $120/month. A new line on any 5G Unlimited plan is required per smartphone. You can also stack this with Verizon's current tablet and smartwatch promotions, which offer up to $279.99 off these devices.

Verizon is also a great place to buy stocking stuffers for techies during the holiday season with its abundant accessory sales. Right now it has up to $50 off Anker speakers, 30% off Nimble chargers, 20% off Apple Watch bands, and 20% off Mophie chargers.

Visible

Verizon's Visible brand has $10 off its premium Visible+ service, now priced at $35/month with the promo code 35FOR6 used at checkout. This promotion will last for six months, and after it ends it will return to the regular price of $45/month for the Visible+ service.

Visible offers all of the latest smartphones, including iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models. When you join Visible, you'll save up to $240 via monthly bill credits on your account. You'll need to join Visible on a new line of service, purchase a new device, and select the Visible+ plan.

T-Mobile

We've been tracking a great all-time low discount on the ninth generation iPad since Prime Day, and the deal is still around in November. You can get the 64GB Wi-Fi iPad for $229.99, down from $329.00.
