                <textarea id="text" readonly> Davis Cup buzz was a highlight during the finals of the 41st annual Hal Wagner Memorial Tennis Tournament on Monday at Rafael Racquet Club.

Larkspur’s Shibu Lal, the wily Davis Cup veteran for Bangladesh, teamed up with Greek newbie Mike Pervolarakis to capture the Open men’s doubles crown with a three-set thriller against top-seeded Ryan Cardiff and Noah Williamson Chapman, 7-6 (7), 5-7, 7-5.

While Lal boasts 25 Davis Cup appearances as a player, captain and coach, Pervolarakis gained recent notoriety as a complement to Stefanos Tsitsipas for Greece, which faces Slovakia in Athens Sept. 16-17.

Lal connected with Pervolarakis at the Tiburon Challenger last year and again during the Golden Gate Open at Stanford earlier this summer, setting up a partnership that produced a fiery final before a standing-room-only crowd in San Rafael.

“He’s a great guy, a great player,” Lal said of Pervolarakis. “He said he looked me up — he told me ‘You are the legend in Davis Cup.’ It’s great for our local players to see him play. Actually, he covered me a lot today.”

Lal and Pervolarakis collected the first-place prize of $800. This year’s tournament had a total purse of $3,300.

The four-day event drew 217 entries in 15 doubles divisions, ranging from 3.0 to Open for men, women and mixed.

The Open men’s doubles final lasted nearly three hours and boiled down to two breaks of serve in the final three games. Just when it looked like the top seeds would prevail, Pervolarakis ripped a forehand return through the middle of the court to tie the set at 5-5. Lal then held serve to make it 6-5, and Lal and Pervolarakis used offsetting junk and pace, respectively, to steal the final set.

“It just gets more exciting every year,” said Lisa Berg, tournament director. “We get a lot of returning players and we get some new Open players each year. We learn things each year.”

The Open men’s final also gave local tennis enthusiasts a chance to see Williamson Chapman in action. He played at Skidmore College but has been teaching during the summer at Rafael Racquet Club and has served as assistant pro over the past year. Cardiff played at Cal and has been team manager for the Bears.

Here are other winners from the Hal Wagner tournament: Gregor Stewart and Chris Jones (3.0 men); Charlie Norman and Gabriel Sandrolini (3.5 men); Nick Notti and Paul McGeehan (4.0 men); David Hultman and Geoff Cykman (4.5 men); Joanna Brook and Holly Myers (3.0 women); Melinda Whitmore and Tori Herzog (3.5 women); Jessica Schulz and Alison Hagopian (4.0 women); Lisa Trusheim and Jennifer Slippy (4.5 women); Maryia Meliuk and Gayatri Ramesh (Open women); Ashley Hellyer and Tom Poser (3.0 mixed); Kevin Scheer and Amy Atherton (3.5 mixed); Brian Schulz and Alison Hagopian (4.0 mixed); Jeffery Birkenseer and Lisa Everest (4.5 mixed); plus Allie Will and Connor Van Alstyne (Open mixed). </textarea>
