                <textarea id="text" readonly> After nearly seven weeks in captivity, 13 Israeli hostages abducted by Hamas and other groups during the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel were released on Friday as part of a deal that paused the fighting in the Gaza Strip.

The 13 — all women and children — were returned to Israel. Five other hostages had been released or rescued earlier in the fighting.

Twelve of those newly released were among the roughly 75 people who had been kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7. One of the 13 was among those taken from Kibbutz Nirim.

In addition, 10 Thais and one Filipino were freed, but details about their identities have not been released. </textarea>
