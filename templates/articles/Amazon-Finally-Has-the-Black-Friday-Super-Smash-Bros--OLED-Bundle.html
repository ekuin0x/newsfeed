                <textarea id="text" readonly> The Super Smash Bros. OLED Nintendo Switch bundle has been available at retailers since Sunday November 19, but Black Friday at Amazon hasn't seen it until now. This is also one of the best Black Friday Nintendo Switch deals around, and since Amazon waited so long it's probably going to end up being the best Nintendo Cyber Monday deal, too.

Best Nintendo Switch Deal: Super Smash Bros. OLED Bundle

Nintendo Switch - OLED Model: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Bundle Switch OLED model, a digital download of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and a three-month subscription to Nintendo Switch Online. 17% off $417.97 3 $349.00 See on Amazon

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is, of course, one of the best games ever created. Even if you don't like its fighting style, you have to respect the sheer volume of content in Smash Ultimate. It doesn't even seem possible, but there are 89 fighters in all. That, alone, is a pretty astonishing feat and an incredible homage to gaming as a whole, but then you have the stages, the spirits, the music. It's incredible.

The best Nintendo Switch bundle deal of Black Friday is also the best Nintendo Switch gift for Christmas, because it's the OLED edition with the bigger and better screen, a digital code for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, a 3 month membership to Nintendo Switch Online, and you get the special-edition Super Smash Bros. Joy-con controllers, all for $349.99.

That's the price of a regular Nintendo Switch OLED model without the special controllers or the other extras. All told you're saving about $65 buying this bundle. The best part is if you're giving the Smash OLED bundle as a gift to someone this Christmas season, they can start playing right away. Obviously, yeah, Super Smash Bros. comes with it, but the 3-months Nintendo Switch Online membership gets you (or whoever you give this to as a gift) access to classic Super NES and NES games while the subscription is active.

Nintendo Switch Online NSO + 12-Month Expansion Pass This code gets you one year of access to the baseline Nintendo Switch Online package and the expansion pass, which includes way more content. 0 $49.88 See on Amazon

Nintendo Switch Online Black Friday Deals

There are also deals on NSO membership, if you're looking to save money. Which seems obvious now that I'm typing it out, because you're reading an article about a Black Friday Nintendo Switch deal.

Nintendo Switch Online 12-Month Individual Membership 10% off $19.99 2 $17.99 See on Amazon Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack 12-month Family Membership â€“ [Digital Code] 10% off $79.99 0 $71.89 See on Amazon

Do You Need a Membership to Nintendo Switch Online?

No, there's no requirement to have an NSO membership. However if you want to play certain online games, you need a membership, and the classic games are locked out for non-members. The Nintendo Switch Online family membership is good for up to eight different people, so if you have a close friend group, you can split the cost. But again: not required! </textarea>
