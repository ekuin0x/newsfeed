                <textarea id="text" readonly> SBS’s “My Demon” has shared a glimpse of Song Kang and Kim Yoo Jung’s evolving relationship!

“My Demon” is a new fantasy rom-com about the contractual marriage between Do Do Hee, a demon-like chaebol heiress who doesn’t trust anyone (played by Kim Yoo Jung), and Jung Gu Won, an actual demon who unexpectedly loses his powers (played by Song Kang).

Spoilers

The first episode of “My Demon” ended on a cliffhanger, with Gu Won’s demonic powers being mysteriously transferred to Do Do Hee—along with the cross tattoo on his wrist that signified his status.

In newly released stills from the drama’s next episode, Gu Won and Do Do Hee get into a tense confrontation at the hospital. Pointing at the cross tattoo that is now on her wrist, Gu Won issues a stern warning as a bewildered Do Do Hee clutches her arm and stares back at him in shock.

Later, Gu Won grabs Do Do Hee by the wrist as she looks up at him in disbelief.

However, in the next set of photos, the dynamic between the two characters has visibly changed. Somewhere in between all that bickering, the tension between them seems to have softened and transformed into something slightly more romantic.

The producers of “My Demon” teased, “Episode 2 will depict the suffering of demon Gu Won, who has lost his powers. The drastic and sudden changes to the previously flawless Gu Won’s life will be fun to watch.”

They went on, “Please also look forward to the thrilling change in the relationship between Do Do Hee and Gu Won.”

The next episode of “My Demon” will air on November 25 at 10 p.m. KST.
