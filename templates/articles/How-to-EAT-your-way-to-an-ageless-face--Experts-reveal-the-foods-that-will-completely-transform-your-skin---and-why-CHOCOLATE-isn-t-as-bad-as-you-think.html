                <textarea id="text" readonly> If you are looking to improve your skin and achieve an ageless complexion, all it takes is one trip to the grocery store, according to experts.

Multiple nutritionists, dieticians and a dermatologist revealed to DailyMail.com exactly what to eat if you wanted to achieve that picture-perfect glow, and what 'underrated' foods you should be eating more of.

Some of these foods include things like chocolate — and even oysters and hemp seeds.

FEMAIL has broken down all of the best foods to eat, starting off with a wide selection that have extremely beneficial vitamins and minerals.

A team of experts including dermatologists and nutritionists have revealed to DailyMail.com the best foods to eat for younger-looking, healthy skin — including chocolate

Registered dietician Steph Grasso, above, has revealed her top tips to DailyMail.com, including what foods to prioritize for healthy skin

Prioritize foods that are rich in vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats — such as oysters

'The best foods to prioritize for healthy, hydrated skin are foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals and healthy fats,' Jamie Nadeau, a registered dietician based in Rhode Island, told DailyMail.com.

'Foods like colorful fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, and fatty fishes are always a great idea for skin health.'

Nadeau explained that some of these foods include ones that were high in Vitamin C, such as tomatoes and citrus fruits, as they can 'support' collagen in your body.

She also recommended eating salmon, blueberries and nuts, as they can all be extremely helpful in aiding your overall skin health.

In particular, she called salmon an 'excellent choice.'

'Not only is it rich in protein but it's also rich in anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids,' she explained.

'It's also a source of vitamin E, which is an important antioxidant for skin health.'

Steph Grasso, a registered dietician from Virginia, likes to look out for foods that contain vitamins C, A, and E.

Nutritionist Jamie Nadeau explained that it was important to eat foods that were 'rich' in both vitamins and minerals

New York dermatologist Dr. Leah Ansell also echoed the importance of eating foods that have large amounts of vitamins

Oysters are high in zinc, which can be extremely beneficial to the skin as well, one expert explained

Grasso tells DailyMail.com that foods with vitamin E, like avocados and fish, 'aid in moisture retention,' while items such as eggs, sweet potatoes and mangoes contain vitamin A, which is 'important for skin cell production and repair.'

She also looks for foods with zinc in them, as they can help with healing wounds and inflammation.

These foods include things like legumes, oysters, quinoa and oats, Grasso explained.

New York-based dermatologist Dr. Leah Ansell agreed, echoing the fact that intaking vitamins A, C, and E are quite important for skin health, although those things alone are not going to be the answer to everything.

'There is no one food or drink that will miraculously lead to clear healthy skin,' she told DailyMail.com.

'But there is data to support certain behaviors and choices that can set one's skin to be in its optimized state.

'While there's not a lot of hard data, general principles to help combat free radical damage and build collagen help guide good food choices for those looking to optimize healthy skin.

'Bone broth, fruits and veggies rich in vitamins A, C, E and folate (berries, sweet potatoes, leafy greens, broccoli) are some great options.'

Eat foods that contain omega-3 fatty acids, like edamame

If you are particularly looking to focus on foods that will encourage skin hydration, Grasso suggested items that contain omega-3 fatty acids, like walnuts and sardines.

She explains that they 'help strengthen the skin's natural barrier.'

'This acts as a protective shield against environmental stressors and prevents water loss from the skin, resulting in better moisture retention and hydrated, plump skin,' Grasso told DailyMail.com.

'Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids include fatty fish (salmon, sardines, albacore tuna, anchovies), flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, hemp seeds, and edamame.'

New York-based nutritionist Jenna Werner, owner of nutrition practice Happy Strong Healthy, also recommended eating avocado and olive oils to get in those omega-3s and healthy fats into your diet.

Proper hydration is absolutely crucial for healthy, glowing skin

Of course, staying hydrated and eating foods that have a high water content are extremely important when it comes to having youthful-looking skin.

'THE KEY is hydration,' Werner told DailyMail.com.

'So drinking water and making sure you are properly hydrated is first and foremost the most important thing for hydrated and glowy skin!'

'Water, electrolytes, and hydration rich foods like fruits and veggies are key!' she continued.

Holistic health coach Sam Garcia, based in Los Angeles, explained exactly why hydrating your skin was so important, and how you can do it through food

Jamie Werner, pictured above, also explained why hydration was the 'key' to having great skin

'Things like cucumbers and watermelon are almost all full of water but also oranges, strawberries and peppers are a few others to add in.'

Sam Garcia, a holistic health coach in Los Angeles, revealed that there were definitely some sneaky ways to add in some extra hydration to your everyday meals.

This can be achieved, in part, by simply in a few sprinkles of chia seeds to a smoothie, or on top of a salad.

'Chia, flax, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, almonds, walnuts, avocados, eggs, and beans are all easy ingredients to add to your daily salads or smoothies and are great options for upping skin hydration,' she explained.

Chocolate is not the enemy — it's an underrated skin secret

According to both Grasso and Nadeau, chocolate is not something to be afraid of when it pertains to your skin health.

Although some urban legends have it that chocolate could actually cause acne, that's not necessarily true — at least for some kinds.

'Surprisingly, my favorite indulgence, CHOCOLATE, supports skin health,' Grasso told DailyMail.com.

'However, I'm not referring to a Hershey's milk chocolate bar.

Look for dark chocolate with at least 70 per cent cocoa content or higher to gain potential skin-related benefits.' Jamie Nadeau, a registered dietician

'When considering chocolate and skin health, the quality and content of cocoa matter.

'Cocoa contains flavonoids, antioxidants that may offer potential skin benefits.

'The higher the cocoa content, the more flavonoids the chocolate is likely to contain. Look for dark chocolate with at least 70 per cent cocoa content or higher to gain potential skin-related benefits.'

Nadeau was another dark chocolate champion, citing that it was high in antioxidants, which can improve hydration and reduce inflammation, among other benefits.

'Dark chocolate is high in antioxidants, and some research shows that it can help your skin to withstand more UV radiation,' she said.

'Be sure to choose dark chocolate that is at least 70 per cent cocoa.'

Chocolate is a surprising food that can support skin health, but not your typical Hershey's bar

'Cocoa contains flavonoids, antioxidants that may offer potential skin benefits,' Grasso explained

Full-fat dairy products are best for acne-prone skin

According to dermatologist Dr. Ansell, those with acne-prone skin should stray away from dairy products that aren't full fat.

'For acne, studies have shown low fat dairy and eating processed carbohydrates (white bread, pasta, desserts, for example) can worsen acne,' she told DailyMail.com.

'Despite what you may have been told — eating greasy foods like pizza or fatty foods like chocolate doesn't necessarily worsen acne.

'I always recommend sticking to unprocessed carbs, full-fat dairy products, avoiding whey protein powder and eating lean proteins to optimize skin for those more acne-prone patients.'

On the other hand, Nadeau also recommended people who suspect their acne was being caused by dairy cut it out of their diets for a few months.

'Research shows that removing dairy from your diet can be helpful for some people who are experiencing acne, but not everyone,' the dietician said.

'You can experiment by removing dairy for a few months to see if you notice any improvement. If not, it's unlikely to be the culprit of your acne.'

Nadeau, above, explained that you could even try cutting out dairy from your diet to see if it is irritating your skin

Tomatoes contain a special ingredient that can prevent aging

Tomatoes are also a food that can have anti-aging properties due to their bioactive components.

'Tomatoes-carotenoids are the classes of bioactive compounds found in tomatoes. Lycopene is one of the major carotenoids which make up the antioxidant properties of a tomato,' Garcia explained to DailyMail.com.

'Lycopene defends cells from oxidative damage and is commonly used in dermatological products for its protection against aging and UV rays.'

However, there are different ways to best get these bioactive components into your body.

'Lycopene is fat soluble and is best absorbed in the body when combined with additional fat. Try heating tomatoes with some olive oil to increase absorption,' she said.

Alcohol and processed foods aren't great, but you don't have to completely cut them out

Consuming alcoholic beverages can cause your skin to become dehydrated or even a flushed face, according to Medical News Today, but it doesn't mean that you have to stop enjoying it completely.

Garcia explained that while things like alcohol, sugar, and processed foods aren't the best, many won't fully want to cut these items out from their diets.

'It's not realistic to suggest we eliminate these foods entirely from our diet, but it is imperative that we lower the intake,' she told DailyMail.com.

'Despite what you may have been told - eating greasy foods like pizza or fatty foods like chocolate doesn't necessarily worsen acne,' Dr. Ansell said

'Eating consciously and intentionally will help you make the best decisions for your body, so you can eat foods you love but also minimize foods that don't make you feel good or support your health goals.

'If you want to look glowy and youthful and reduce wrinkles then you have to cut the crap out of your diet.'

Dr. Ansell also stressed that there were other things people should be doing to maintain great skin, working on your diet is just one of those elements.

'I think a healthy diet may augment acne treatment but often on its own is not enough,' she explained.

'For anti-aging purposes I think the effect is subtle and not a silver bullet.

'But, in combination with great skincare and sun protection can be an important element.' </textarea>
