                <textarea id="text" readonly> Erling Haaland has smashed Andy Cole's record by 17 games as he becomes the fastest player to hit fifty Premier League goals.

The Norwegian sensation's well-taken opener against Liverpool brings up his fiftieth goal in the league since joining Manchester City for Â£51m in 2022.

He has done it in just 48 appearances in the league, breaking Manchester United striker Andy Cole's longstanding record of 65.

The 23-year-old now tops a star-studded list of strikers, with Alan Shearer (66), Ruud van Nistelrooy (68), Fernando Torres and Mohammed Salah (72) the closest competition.

Haaland also broke records during the last campaign for the most goals in a 38-game season, netting an incredible 36 times by the end of the league campaign.

Manchester United striker Andy Cole held the original record scoring 50 goals in 65 appearances

He was an integral part of the Treble winning campaign, and also chipped in with 12 Champions League goals in 11 appearances.

Haaland opened the scoring for Pep Guardiola's side in their crunch match with Liverpool at the Etihad.

Nathan Ake brilliantly set up the goal, beating two defenders with ease before finding Haaland on the edge of the area.

The big striker took a touch to settle himself, another to get it out of his feet and then finished brilliantly passed Alisson with the third.

He has broken Cole's record, however Haaland's tally includes penalties, while the Englishman never stepped up to score from the spot.

This won't matter to the Norwegian or any Manchester City fan as they continue to watch the striker tear up the Premier League

Haaland will now undoubtedly have his eyes set on breaking the next Premier League record, the fastest to 100 goals.

The leagues all-time top scorer Alan Shearer holds this record, hitting the century in just 124 appearances.

Man City were ultimately pegged back by Liverpool as Trent Alexander-Arnold ensured his side took a point. </textarea>
