Not only did Paris Hilton surprise fans over Thanksgiving by announcing she had welcomed a newborn daughter — but she surprised her family, too.

In an appearance on "Live with Kelly and Mark" Monday, Hilton said that she and her husband Carter Reum kept the arrival of baby London a secret from her family until the holiday.

"Thanksgiving was amazing. Of course, that's when I surprised the whole family with London," the reality star said.

Hilton said that Reum gathered the entire family in the living room around 5 p.m., before dinner, and told them that there was going to be a surprise.

"Everyone thought, like, a magician was coming. Like, we have a performer coming in, so everyone's all excited," Hilton said. "I walk in just holding a pink blanket with the baby and everybody was sitting there like, 'What?'"

Hilton added: "They couldn't believe it. It was the best Thanksgiving I've ever had in my life."

Hilton announced the arrival of her and Reum's second child on social media last Thursday.

"Thankful for my baby girl," Hilton captioned an Instagram post featuring a pink top with the name "London" on it.

Representatives for Hilton confirmed to Business Insider that the reality star welcomed London via a surrogate, like her firstborn child, son Phoenix.

Hilton said on her "I Am Paris" podcast in February that she didn't tell her family about Phoenix until a week after his birth in January.

"We were just nervous because if we tell one person, then they tell someone, and then all of a sudden it's in TMZ and Page Six," Hilton said. "I have had enough of my life like that."

In March, Hilton told Rolling Stone that she surprised her mom, Kathy Hilton, with baby Phoenix while they were exchanging belated Christmas gifts.

Kathy told Extra in March: "I was in complete shock."

Kathy's reaction was recorded and will be used in the second season of Hilton's reality show, "Paris in Love," which premieres on Peacock on Thursday. </textarea>
