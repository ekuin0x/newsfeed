                <textarea id="text" readonly> LYNCHBURG, Va. – Liberty Men's Tennis assistant coach, Christiaan Worst , a former Flame, will be honored with the opportunity to represent his native South Africa at the 2023 Davis Cup.



Worst joins South Africa, the host country for the Africa Group lll of the Davis Cup. Matches will be held at Worst's hometown Pretoria. The Africa Group lll consists of eight teams from across the region.



It's a massive honor. South Africa has a rich history with the Davis Cup," Worst said. "It's my hometown so my whole family will be there. I'm very proud to be representing South Africa and Liberty. My grandfather who is 92 will be there which is super special because now his son and grandson will have played in the Davis Cup."



Before joining the Flames coaching staff in July, Worst contributed three quality years to the Flames. Worst transferred to Liberty where he immediately made an impact for teams that secured back-to-back ASUN titles. During his first year as a Flame in 2021, Worst was named on the ASUN Doubles Pair of the Year with Deji Thomas-Smith along with a VaSID All-State doubles second team honor.



In three years playing for the Liberty, Worst accumulated a 51-38 singles and a 51-30 doubles record. In his last year playing for Liberty from 2022-23, Worst was named to the VaSID All-State doubles second team with Josh Wilson , the ASUN All-Conference third team and the CSC All-District Academic team.



Worst will focus on doubles with the South Africa team, but he will be the backup for singles if called upon.



"I've always been a proud South African. I've always supported the rugby team and the cricket team… Being able to represent South Africa on the highest level you can is super special," said Worst.



The Davis Cup Group lll will begin round robin play on Wednesday, August 9. Follow along at live.daviscup.com.
