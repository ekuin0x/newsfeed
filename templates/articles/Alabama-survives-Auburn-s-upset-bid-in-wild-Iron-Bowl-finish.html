Ten years after Auburn cornerback Chris Davis returned a missed field goal 109 yards to knock off Alabama in one of college football‚Äôs craziest finishes, the Crimson Tide conjured its own spell of last-minute magic Saturday to stun Auburn, 27-24. The stunners. The cheers. The home runs, hat tricks and gameday magic. Don‚Äôt miss out with The Sports Moment, a newsletter for the biggest sports news. ArrowRight As it did in 2013, this season‚Äôs Iron Bowl carried championship implications, with No. 8 Alabama (11-1, 8-0 SEC) looking to handle Auburn (6-6, 3-5) en route to a highly touted showdown with Georgia in the conference championship game next Saturday.

Alabama trailed by four when the Crimson Tide began its final drive from the Auburn 30 after recovering a muffed punt with 4:48 to play. Three plays later, following a sack that left Alabama with a third and 20, quarterback Jalen Milroe scrambled for 19 yards. Running back Roydell Williams cut upfield for three yards to convert the fourth down.

With a fresh set of downs seven yards from the end zone, the Tide went backward.

Williams lost a yard on first down. Milroe recovered a bad snap for an 18-yard loss on the following play. On third down, Milroe was called for an illegal forward pass that pushed Alabama even further back with 43 seconds to play. Fourth and goal from the 31.

Auburn spent its final timeout after Alabama revealed its offensive formation for the decisive play. Moments later, Milroe took the snap. Auburn rushed two and assigned a spy. Eight Tigers dropped back.

Milroe had ample time in the pocket. He took six seconds to survey his options and could have used more. Then he launched the ball to the back corner of the end zone, where receiver Isaiah Bond created separation, made the catch and tapped a foot in bounds before being shoved out. Touchdown.

On the ensuing Auburn drive, quarterback Payton Thorne was sacked then intercepted to end the game.

Alabama escaped Jordan-Hare Stadium with the victory and retained hopes of qualifying for the College Football Playoff entering its clash with Georgia in the SEC championship game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. It was a welcome outcome for Coach Nick Saban, who 10 years ago watched Auburn produce its own late-game heroics by way of Davis‚Äôs eye-popping return, dubbed the ‚ÄúKick Six.‚Äù

Saban cited that lack of fortune in postgame comments during the CBS broadcast.

‚ÄúBelieve it or not, we work on that, but it was just a great throw by Jalen and a great catch by Isaiah,‚Äù Saban said of the go-ahead touchdown play. ‚ÄúI mean, we work on it but you‚Äôre throwing it up for grabs really, and we came down with it. You know there‚Äôs been some weird stuff [that has happened] here and this is the first time I can remember it going in our favor.‚Äù

Auburn has the "Kick Six."



Alabama has "Fourth And 31."
