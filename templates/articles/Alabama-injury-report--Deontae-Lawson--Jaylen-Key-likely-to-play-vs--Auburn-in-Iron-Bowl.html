                <textarea id="text" readonly> It appears Alabama football could have two of its defensive starters back for the Iron Bowl against Auburn. Deontae Lawson and Jaylen Key are likely to play according to head coach Nick Saban, who shared the news on his pregame radio show appearance.

On Wednesday, Saban sounded more optimistic on their statuses than in previous weeks.

“They both practiced quite a bit this week, Saban said. “We’ll just see how they continue to progress.”

Saban said on the Alabama radio broadcast before the game that both players were likely to play. The two were also on the field for warmups, fully dressed and participating.

Key, Alabama’s starting safety, and Lawson, who calls signals for the defense at inside linebacker, were both injured in the Crimson Tide’s win over LSU. Key suffered a thigh injury while breaking up a pass, while Lawson had an ankle issue.

Those two both missed UA’s wins over Kentucky and Chattanooga. Key was dressed before the UTC game but did not fully participate in warmups and did not play.

Wideout Kobe Prentice also did not play against Chattanooga. He was in uniform and appeared to be participating during the warmup period. Linebacker Quandarrius Robinson, who was injured against the Mocs, was also in uniform, but wideout Ja’Corey Brooks (shoulder) was not on the field for the warmups.

The Iron Bowl is scheduled to kick off at 2:30 p.m. CT. It will be aired on CBS. </textarea>
