                <textarea id="text" readonly> New Zealand's young all-rounder Rachin Ravindra has shone soon after landing in India. Before the start of the ODI World Cup, the youngster played a brilliant knock against Pakistan in the team's first warm-up tie.

The two batters put together a partnership of 179 runs to bail the New Zealand innings out of trouble.

After Rachin was born, Rachin's father took "RA" from Rahul and "chin" from Sachin and combined the two to come up with the name "Rachin".
