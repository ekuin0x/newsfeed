                <textarea id="text" readonly> He had a splint removed from his right forearm this month but offers no guarantee on when he will play competitively again. Loading The former world No.13 is now unranked but can use a temporary protected ranking of No.21 to enter the Australian Open. However, it is more likely Tiley would be willing to give him a wildcard if he is fit to play. “We have spoken to Nick, and he obviously wants to do the best he possibly can, to give him the best chance to play in January,” Tiley said. “Nick’s not only a great tennis player but a pure entertainer. We always love seeing him on court, and off court, and he’s doing more off-court things, which I know he’ll be announcing as well, and I’ve seen some of the initial work on that.

“Nick’s position will be determined closer to the event but as I’ve said before, anytime we can get Nick, it’s great for everyone … but we’ve got to take it as it comes, and he’s got to make sure he takes care of his health because he’s not just got January, he’s got the entire year.” Tiley said Tennis Australia was already well advanced on planning for 2025 and 2026 but did not directly address the idea of a Saudi Masters. “The tennis world itself will continue to have conversations about what’s best for the tennis world, but we feel very secure about what we’re delivering in 2024, 2025, 2026 and beyond,” he said. “The line-up for the United Cup … we’ve pretty much got the entire event covered with the No.1s and best players in the world ... so that is here to stay. That is a unique event that launches the season, the players love it – that’s what they’re telling us – the tours love it, and we have a long-term commitment for that. “There’s ongoing commentary around investment in the sport, and disruptive investment, but Tennis Australia’s an organisation, we underwrite all the lead-in events and, of course, the Australian Open … we’ve got long-term contracts, but we always watch what’s going on as well.”

Never-say-die ‘Demon’ inspires Australia to Davis Cup win with incredible comeback Alex de Minaur’s magnificent resilience and the doubles mastery of Matt Ebden and Max Purcell have earned Australia a great escape in Malaga – straight into the semi-finals of the Davis Cup. De Minaur produced his latest Houdini act with Lleyton Hewitt’s men on the verge of bowing out in their quarter-final tie on Wednesday (Thursday AEDT) amid a barrage of brilliance from their young Czech Republic opponents.

Already 1-0 down after Jordan Thompson had been blitzed 6-4, 7-5 by Tomas Machac, Australian No.1 de Minaur was being blown away by his Czech equivalent Jiri Lehecka, who served for a straight-sets blowout at 5-4 in the second set. It prompted a courtside exhortation from Hewitt assuring the “Demon” he was one of the best returners in the world, and the player built in his captain’s image responded to the praise to then reel off 10 points on the bounce with a familiar scurrying combination of never-say-die defence and fearless attacking. It set him on the way to turn the match around, earn a fantastic 4-6, 7-6 (7-2), 7-5 triumph and pave the way for Ebden and Purcell to beat Lehecka and Adam Pavlasek 6-4, 7-5 in the doubles. It was the pair’s sixth win in seven doubles Davis Cup rubbers together, and they again looked every inch one of the best teams in the game.

Earlier, the 22-year-old Lehecka’s power and accuracy had de Minaur on the ropes for much of the match. Even after he’d gone 2-0 down in the final set, the ever-improving world No.31 rebounded brilliantly, looking poised to reel off four games on the bounce until de Minaur saved three break points at 2-3. Utter determination, despite his evident weariness, dragged the Aussie through in a magnificent contest, as he earned a break in the 11th game of the stanza that was to prove crucial. De Minaur celebrates a point. Credit: AP “I don’t know,” shrugged the exhausted de Minaur, when asked on court how he’d prevailed in the two-and-a-half hour scrap. “I guess it’s part of my identity. Ultimately, it’s always going to be tough. You’re always going to be in a very dark places in matches but maybe I’ve got that reputation of never giving up and I’m competing to the end.

“Lleyton was telling me all match I’m one of the best returners in the world and I’m bound to break him at one stage. He played unbelievable – I’m just lucky to have found a way to beat him.” Hewitt had plumped for the experience of Thompson in the opening singles, despite the claims of the higher-ranked Purcell and Alexei Popyrin, who had been drafted in to replace the injured Thanasi Kokkinakis. Max Purcell and Matt Ebden won the doubles to seal the win for Australia. Credit: Getty Images But Machac, 22 places below “Tommo” in the world rankings, was in scintillating form from the outset as he broke in the opening game to set out his stall. One of the form players on tour over the past couple of months, Machac retained the extra firepower that constantly had the Sydneysider on the retreat as he couldn’t handle the 26 winners from the 23-year-old. </textarea>
