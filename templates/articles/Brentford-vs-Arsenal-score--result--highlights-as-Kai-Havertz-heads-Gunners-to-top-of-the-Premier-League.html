                <textarea id="text" readonly> Kai Havertz's 89th-minute goal fired Arsenal back to the top of the Premier League as they narrowly beat Brentford 1-0.

Despite spending just 10 minutes on the pitch, the German made a crucial impact on a night where the home team did everything possible to thwart Mikel Arteta in his 200th game in charge.

Arsenal had dominated for large periods throughout the match but lacked a ruthless passage of play in the final third. Declan Rice came to the rescue of his goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale in the first half, saving him from embarrassment with a goalline clearance. Oleksandr Zinchenko also made a well-timed intervention on the line, ensuring Ramsdale's clean sheet.

The Gunners did have a goal ruled out for offside prior to taking the lead but failed to create too many clear-cut chances. That was until Bukayo Saka floated a fine cross to the far post where the super substitute Havertz headed home.

It's their 17th unbeaten game in London derbies and they've also kept more clean sheets than any other side in the league this season.

Thomas Frank's hosts never really threatened Arsenal and struggled to get a hold of the ball as Arteta's men were dominant. The Bees sit 11th and have now lost consecutive league games for the second time this season.

Looking ahead, Arsenal prepare for a Champions League clash at home against Lens before facing Wolves next weekend. Brentford will aim to break their losing streak against a favourable opponent in Luton Town.

85th minute: Saliba is the latest to try from distance but his effort was never testing Flekken.

80th minute: Rice hits one from distance! It takes a deflection nd goes out for the corner. The Gunners are knocking on the door in these final stages.

71st minute: Ramsdale is tasked with making a routine save as Yarmolenko takes a shot from outside the box, but he fails to direct his effort goalwards.

65th minute: Nketiah comes on for Jesus. Arsenal need some inspiration to find the breakthrough.

56th minute: A yellow card is issued to Martinelli after a foul on Onyeka; he didn't quite mean to make contact with his opponent but left his foot hanging.

46th minute: We're back underway for the second half. Saka manages to squeeze a cross in and it's deflected wide by Ethan Pinnock. That could have gone anywhere! A bright start by the Gunners.

Back to it



A big 45 ahead 👊



🐝 0-0 🔴#BREARS | #BrentfordFC — Brentford FC (@BrentfordFC) November 25, 2023

HT: That's all for the first half! Brentford haven't been at their best but Arsenal can't quite get the better of them. Arteta's side will be desperate to find a way past Thomas Frank's men if they're to finish the day top of the Premier League.

44th minute: It's ruled out! Trossard's left foot was offside, Brentford can count themselves lucky!

44th minute: GOAL! Arsenal have the ball in the back of the net but VAR are checking for offside. Trossard headed home but was he offside?

37th minute: Mikel Arteta's men are still having the majority of possession in Brentford's half but are finding it difficult to create any goalscoring opportunities. Jesus is the latest to try his luck but once again cannot find the target.

29th minute: Arsenal are struggling to get behind Brentford's resilient defence at the minute. The Bees' backline is holding strong.

22nd minute: Norgaard tries his luck from outside the box but like Trossard's earlier, it rises way over the bar.

13th minute: The pressure has certainly gotten to Aaron Ramsdale! He messes around with the ball inside the six-yard line and stumbles over his own feet but Brentford can't take advantage of the glorious opportunity! Mbeumo fires an effort goalward but Rice rescues his goalkeeper big time.

10th minute: Saka finds Trossard on the edge of the box for Arsenal's first real chance of the match. He can't keep his effort down and blasts it over the bar.

4th minute: Arsenal have started on the front foot here but Brentford are holding their own.

1st minute: The Gunners kick us off!

15 minutes until kickoff: The players are out trying to get warm, kickoff is approaching.

30 minutes until kickoff: After Man City and Liverpool shared the spoils in the early kickoff, Arteta's side can leapfrog both to go top of the Premier League table this evening.

Take a look back at Mikel's most memorable matches as Gunners boss👇 — Arsenal (@Arsenal) November 24, 2023

Brentford vs Arsenal lineups

Frank's decision to switch to a five-man defence didn't bring success at Anfield. If he is to go back to a four-man backline against the Gunners, that would create an opportunity for Neal Maupay. The striker, who became a target of criticism among Arsenal fans after the Bernd Leno incident in 2020, could lead the hosts' attack.

Brentford starting lineup (4-3-3, left to right): Flekken — Ajer, Mee, Pinnock, Janelt — Norgaard, Yarmolyuk, Onyeka — Mbeumo, Wissa, Ghoddos.

Brentford subs (12): To be confirmed

Arteta won't be able to use David Raya as his goalkeeper this weekend since the Brentford loanee is not allowed to play against his parent club. As a result, Aaron Ramsdale is set to make his first Premier League start in over two and a half months.

Gabriel Jesus surprised everyone with his speedy recovery from a hamstring injury, enabling him to join Brazil for their World Cup qualifiers. However, it would be surprising if he is immediately included in the Arsenal XI. As for skipper Martin Odegaard, Ben White, and Cedric Soares, their status will be assessed closer to the match. There is optimism that Odegaard might make his return in the west London derby.

Arsenal starting lineup (4-3-3, left to right): Ramsdale — Tomiyasu, Saliba, Gabriel, Zinchenko — Rice, Trossard, Odegaard — Saka, Jesus, Martinelli.

Arsenal subs (12): To be confirmed
