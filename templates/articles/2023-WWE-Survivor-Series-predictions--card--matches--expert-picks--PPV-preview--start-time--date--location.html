                <textarea id="text" readonly> One of the biggest PPV events of the year is set for Saturday night in Illinois. WWE returns to Rosemont, Illinois for Survivor Series on Saturday night where some massive storylines are set to play out. There will be plenty of superstars in action when a pair of WarGames matches take center stage just outside of Chicago.

In one WarGames match, the team of Cody Rhodes, Sami Zayn, Jey Uso, Seth Rollins and the returning Randy Orton will face off with JD McDonagh, Drew McIntyre, Damian Priest, Finn Balor and Dominik Mysterio. The other features Damage CTRL's team of Bayley, Asuka, Iyo Sky and Kairi Sane taking on the team of Charlotte Flair, Bianca Belair, Becky Lynch and Shotzi.

Rhodes, Uso and Rollins have had their run-ins with the Judgement Day for months now as the faction continues to wreak havoc on Monday nights. They utilize their numbers advantage to get the upperhand nearly every week, including winning back the undisputed tag team titles after Rhodes and Uso were victorious at Fastlane. Now, with even more bad blood storylines included between Rollins and McIntyre, and a returning Orton, things are sure to get out of hand quickly.

In the women's match, there have been seeds of discord among Damage CTRL for months now. But with Asuka turning heel and joining the team along with a returning Sane, things seem to be on more level terms as they take on some of the top superstars in the company. There could be some interesting dynamics at play with Bayley seeming to lose her spot as the leader of the group.

Let's take a look at who the CBS Sports experts expect to win each match at Survivor Series, which goes down Saturday and streams live on Peacock at 8 p.m. ET with a kickoff show one hour prior.

WWE Survivor Series 2023 predictions

Cody Rhodes, Sami Zayn, Jey Uso, Seth Rollins & Randy Orton vs. JD McDonagh, Drew McIntyre, Damian Priest, Finn Balor & Dominick Mysterio (WarGames Match)

As is the case with most WarGames matches, there are about 30 sub-plots at play here. Still, it's hard to get past just the idea of Randy Orton returning from his long layoff and not having his hand raised at the end of the match. The only real way I can grasp that mentally is Orton turning on his team to align with Judgment Day. But, really, what's the point of having a JD McDonagh in WarGames if not to have him be the one who eats the loss? Pick: Rhodes, Zayn, Uso, Rollins & Orton win -- Brent Brookhouse (also Shakiel Mahjouri)

Damage CTRL (Bayley, Asuka, Iyo Sky & Kairi Sane) vs. Charlotte Flair, Bianca Belair, Becky Lynch & Shotzi

Damage CTRL is looking overcrowded but it's imperative the company makes good on this reset. The original group had a lot of potential but was plagued by inconsistent booking. The sense is that Bayley will eventually get ousted from the group. If WWE wants anyone to care about the story, they need to believe that Damage CTRL is a big deal. Sky, Sane and Asuka have a lot of history together. Bayley can be the weak link on Saturday but Damage CTRL should surely overcome a mish-mash of former rivals. Pick: Damage CTRL win -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)

Intercontinental Championship -- Gunther (c) vs. The Miz

The most interesting part of this match is just how easily WWE fans can go with a somewhat random turn. Miz has been almost exclusively a heel for years and years now but by winning a single fatal five-way and standing up to Gunther, he's now being presented as -- and more importantly accepted as -- a babyface. Miz isn't going to win this match because that would be a massive fumble of Gunther's record-setting run with the intercontinental championship. Pick: Gunther retains the title -- Brookhouse (also Mahjouri)

Women's World Championship -- Rhea Ripley (c) vs. Zoey Stark

This match is meant to accomplish two things: extend Ripley's reign of terror and showcase Starks in-ring talents. The match itself should produce some solid highlights but the outcome is not in doubt. Ripley's eventual defeat requires much more than a short build and a battle royal to crown the challenger. Pick: Rhea Ripley retains the title -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)

Carlito vs. Santos Escobar

WWE has a chance to turn Escobar into a legitimate player. It would make no sense to have him lose to a midcard veteran like Carlito. Escobar should overcome Carlito's initial fire and get a clean victory as he begins a new chapter as an emerging top heel on the main roster. Pick: Santos Escobar wins -- Brookhouse (also Mahjouri) </textarea>
