                <textarea id="text" readonly> Wiggle and Chain Reaction have slashed prices for road, gravel and mountain bikes this Black Friday.

Advertisement MPU article

The online cycling retailers have up to 40 per cent off a huge variety of bikes, from hybrids to electric mountain bikes.

They aren’t only offering savings on budget options, but on bikes with top-spec components including SRAM Red AXS and XX Eagle Transmission drivetrains.

Whether the savings are due to the companies’ recent financial woes is unknown, but what we do know is there are some great deals to be had.

Chain Reaction

Nukeproof’s Giga features a full-monocoque carbon fibre frame that has 170mm of rear-wheel travel but can be mulleted to add 10mm more.

The spec is off the charts for its price. The bike has a RockShox Super Deluxe Ultimate rear shock, a 180mm RockShox Zeb Ultimate fork and SRAM’s XX Eagle Transmission.

The Vitus Energie Evo is, nominally, a cyclocross bike, but in testing we found it to be a perfectly competent all-rounder.

And you can’t really go wrong when such a versatile bike is discounted by a whopping 43 per cent.

Buy now from Chain Reaction £1,299.99
