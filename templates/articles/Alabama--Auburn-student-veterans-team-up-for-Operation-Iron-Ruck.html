                <textarea id="text" readonly> The University of Alabama and Auburn University will join forces in a Thanksgiving week march across the state to raise awareness about the suicide rate among veterans.

Members of UA’s Crimson Legion and Auburn’s Student Veterans Association will participate in the sixth annual Operation Iron Ruck, which will begin in Tuscaloosa on Wednesday and end in Auburn on Saturday before the Iron Bowl kicks off at 2:30 p.m. at Jordan-Hare Stadium.

Organizers say that the objective of Operation Iron Ruck is to set aside the Alabama-Auburn rivalry and promote camaraderie among student-veterans while giving back to veterans around Alabama.

Jordan Golden, president of the UA Campus Veterans Association, said in a UA news release that Operation Iron Ruck "offers a personal level of support to those who participate. It’s a chance to decompress and meet new people that can relate to the struggles veterans are going through.”

The student-veteran participants in Operation Iron Ruck will march a total of 151 miles while carrying 22-pound rucksacks that contain donated items. The weight of the rucksacks represents the estimated 22 veterans who die by suicide every day. Monetary and material donations will be distributed to Three Hots and A Cot, Mission 22, the Bill Nichols State Veterans Home and Tuskegee VA Medical Center.

The "ruckers" will also carry the game ball from Tuscaloosa to Auburn for the Iron Bowl.

During the march, each student will hike about 50 miles and walk for 2½ hours before climbing into a support vehicle for about five hours of rest beginning the next leg of the hike.

“I look forward to Operation Iron Ruck every year to see my family from the other side of the state,” Golden said. “Having personal experience with losing friends to suicide, I make it my mission to get the word out to other veterans that it is OK not to be OK, and we are here to help you.”

According to the event's website, organizers of the 2023 Operation Iron Ruck set a goal of raising $25,000.
