                <textarea id="text" readonly> Borussia Dortmund are said to be keeping a close eye on the development of highly rated striker Francesco Camarda, who has already been included in the AC Milan senior squad at the age of 15.

Francesco Camarda may only be 15, but he could be set to make his first-team debut for AC Milan on Saturday. The striker is regarded as one of the most exciting young talents in Italy and has been scoring goals for fun at the youth level. He has also found the back of the net on three occasions in just three appearances for the Milan U-19s in the UEFA Youth League this season.

With Olivier Giroud, Rafael Leão and Noah Okafor currently sidelined, Camarda has been called up to the AC Milan first-team squad ahead of their Serie A clash against Fiorentina.

This comes just days before the Italian side’s crunch home game against Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League group stage. If he plays on Saturday, Camarda would become the youngest player in Serie A history.

It is no surprise that Borussia Dortmund, who are known for giving young players chances to play at the highest level, have Camarda on their scouting list. However, BILD claim that the chances of the 15 year old making the switch to the Black and Yellows are considered to be very slim.

Manchester City are also thought to be interested in signing the highly rated forward, while AC Milan would like to offer him a professional contract as soon as possible. </textarea>
