                <textarea id="text" readonly> Generally speaking long term investing is the way to go. But along the way some stocks are going to perform badly. To wit, the Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien (ETR:BVB) share price managed to fall 58% over five long years. That is extremely sub-optimal, to say the least. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 17% in the last 90 days.

With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.

While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).

During five years of share price growth, Borussia Dortmund GmbH Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.

The revenue decline of 1.5% isn't too bad. But if the market expected durable top line growth, then that could explain the share price weakness.
