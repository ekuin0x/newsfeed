                <textarea id="text" readonly> 'We're going to have it all' - Man City fans celebrate league title with treble in sight

Borussia Dortmund took a huge leap towards their first Bundesliga title since 2012 after defeating FC Augsburg 3-0 at the WWK Arena to move two points clear at the top of the table.

The fixture was also important for the home side, as they came into it just three points clear of the relegation play-off place.

Despite Dortmund struggling against Augsburg at this venue in previous seasons, the away side played the first half with purpose, and created many chances to take the lead.

With 38 minutes on the clock, however, everything changed as Augsburg centre-back Felix Uduokhai was shown a straight red card for taking down Donyell Malen whilst the forward was in a clear goalscoring opportunity.

After hitting the woodwork on two separate occasions, BVB finally got the lead they craved in the 58th minute, as Sebastien Haller lashed home a low strike into the far corner past Tomas Koubek.

With six minutes to play Dortmund had another big opening as Malen advanced in on goal, but his close-range effort could only be parried by Koubek. Luckily for BVB, Haller was there to pounce on the rebound and slotted the ball home to double his side’s advantage.

Julian Brandt put icing on the cake with a third in injury time to seal the victory.

A win next week for Dortmund in their final game of the season at home against Mainz would see them regain the Meisterschale for the first time in 11 years.

TALKING POINT - Dortmund make most of Bayern’s slip and now one win from glory

Going into the extended break for the 2022 World Cup, Dortmund sat in sixth place in the Bundesliga table and nine points behind Bayern Munich. Fast forward six months, and Die Schwartzgelben now have a golden opportunity to reclaim the title that has been out of their grasp since the days of when a famous manager called Jurgen Klopp graced the touchline at the Westfalenstadion.

The 2022-23 season has been one of twists and turns, and coming into this 32nd matchday of the campaign, Edin Terzic and his players knew that to stand a chance at winning the league, they needed Bayern to drop points. Their wish was granted on Saturday night by Leipzig, but the team still had it all to do against an Augsburg outfit that can be categorised as a 'bogey' team in recent years for BVB. Dortmund had won just one of their last four away games against Augsburg coming into the game.

However, in truth, that hoodoo did not hang over their heads. Dortmund were by far the better side, and by half-time had amassed 16 shots and an expected goals (xG) output of over 2.4 despite not breaking the deadlock.

That all changed in the second half, and BVB made their man advantage count and ran away with the game. It is now all down to next week against Bo Svensson's mid-table Mainz side, a team Dortmund have not lost to since June 2020 - a run of five matches without defeat.

PLAYER OF THE MATCH - Sebastien Haller

The 28-year-old forward has been in top form recently for his club, and this match was no exception as he notched a brace to take his tally for the season in all competitions to nine.

Haller was there to provide that focal point in the box and showed he knew to be at the right place at the right time to capitalise.

In total, Haller completed 81% of his passes, made two successful dribbles, had three shots on target and made one successful tackle.

After what the Ivory Coast international has been through with his health in recent years, it would be fitting if the goals he scored in this match are able to play a part in seeing Dortmund over the line next weekend.

MATCH HIGHLIGHTS

24’ - GREAT SAVE! - Kobek keeps Dortmund out with an important stop! Hummels plays a fantastic long ball forward for Brandt, and he feeds it to his left for Haller. The forward is through on goal, but opts to take a couple of extra touches, riding the challenge from Uduokhai in the process. He eventually gets his low strike on target, but Kobek makes a great point-blank save to tip it over the bar!

38’ - RED CARD! (Felix Uduokhai) - Uduokhai is shown a red card for Augsburg! He bundles down Malen outside the box but the Dutchman was the last man! The attacker was clearly denied a goalscoring opportunity. After an initial delay to make the decision, the referee brandishes the red card for the Augsburg centre-back.

41’ - OFF THE POST! - The foul for the sending off gives BVB a free-kick in a dangerous position just outside the box on the left-hand side. Malen delivers the set-piece towards the back post, and Sule jumps highest to meet it, but his header crashes off the upright and stays out!

54’ - CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? - Dortmund hit the woodwork again! Can hits a bobbling shot with a distinct lack of power from 20 yards out, and it deceives Koubek in the Augsburg goal and it comes crashing back off the bottom of the left-hand post!

59’ - GOAL! (Sebastien Haller) - The away side finally take a key chance in the match and it stands to take BVB back to the top of the Bundesliga table! Malen initially runs down the right flank and tries to find the Ivorian with a low cross into the box, but it rebounds off an Augsburg defender straight to Haller's path. He takes it on the half-turn and lashes home a low strike into the far corner of the net!

84’ - GOAL! (Sebastien Haller) - BVB double their lead and they look like they have the win they craved! Malen initially advances in on goal after picking up the ball off Brandt in the penalty area. His low shot is beaten away by Koubek, but the rebound falls straight to Haller, and he sends it home! It is a brace for the Ivorian!

90+3’ - GOAL! (Julian Brandt) - Schlotterbeck steals the ball off an Augsburg player just outside the box, and slides it forward for Brandt to chase, and the midfielder makes no mistake and places it into the far corner past Koubek from close range. What a day for BVB!
