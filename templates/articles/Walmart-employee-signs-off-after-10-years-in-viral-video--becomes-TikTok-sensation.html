                <textarea id="text" readonly> A longtime Walmart employee has gone viral on social media as she gave an emotional sign-off to her fellow employees, signaling the “end of an era.”

Gail Lewis has turned into an internet icon for calling it quits at the multinational chain in Illinois, where she’s worked for the past 10 years.

“Attention Walmart, this is Gail Lewis,” she said into a walkie-talkie. “10-year associate Morris, Illinois 8-4-4, signing out, good night.”

While she remained brief and to the point during her sign-off, Lewis became emotional when she got to her car after leaving her beloved store for the last time.

“So today was an end of an era for me,” Lewis said. “What you just saw was me signing out for the last time at my Walmart that I have worked at for 10 years.”

Lewis then described her bittersweet feelings of happiness and sadness leaving her beloved store.

“It’s a happy sad because I’m gonna be going to a better job and those people became like family. I’ve been through a lot with them. They watched my back, I watched theirs. They helped me out, I helped them out,” Lewis said.

“We even went through a f–king pandemic together,” she said about her coworkers. “It just hurts but it’s a happy sad because where I’m going, I’m gonna be better off where I’m at, that’s all.”

The viral video has been viewed over 22.5 million times since she uploaded it on Nov. 16, tallying over 80,000 followers and many people have gone on to create wild stories about her past.

A fabricated backstory created by social media users, has Lewis running in the NFL with captions regarding Lewis’ ability to stop shoplifters or comparing the former Walmart employee to the career of MLB superstar Mike Trout.

Lewis has also received over 38,800 comments with most of them congratulating the now-former Walmart associate.

“Best of luck to you Gail,” one comment read.

“Gotta put the vest in the rafters after dat one,” another comment joked, referring to the practice by teams to sporting events hanging retired numbers/jerseys above the playing surface.

Lewis has yet to reveal what her new job is.

“I am grateful to Gail for her service at the Morris, IL store, and she will be greatly missed. I wish her all the best on her future opportunities,” Carrie Moses, the Morris store’s manager, said through corporate, according to NBC. </textarea>
