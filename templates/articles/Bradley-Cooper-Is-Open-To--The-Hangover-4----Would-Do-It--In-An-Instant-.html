                <textarea id="text" readonly> Although Bradley Cooper is taking on more serious roles as of late, the Maestro star is not opposed to revisiting his past role as Phil in The Hangover franchise.

The actor opened up about reprising his role in the Tod Phillips comedy that he starred in 2009 alongside Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Heather Graham, Justin Bartha, Ken Jeong and Jeffrey Tambor.

“I would probably do Hangover 4 in an instant,” Cooper said during an appearance on The New Yorker Radio Hour. “Just because I love Todd, I love Zach, I love Ed so much, I probably would.”

Despite Cooper not objecting to returning to The Hangover, he doesn’t think the director would be down for another sequel.

“I don’t think Todd is ever going to do that,” Cooper added.

The Hangover follows Phil (Cooper), Stu Price (Helms), Alan Garner (Galifianakis) and Doug Billings (Bartha) as they travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party in honor of Doug who is about to get married. However, things get hazy when after their party night out they wake up and Doug is missing and no one remembers what happened the previous night.

The film went on to generate over $469M at the worldwide box office. A sequel would follow in 2011 titled The Hangover Part II and another sequel would close out the trilogy in 2013 with The Hangover Part III.

In 2021, Galifianakis jokingly talked to Extra about what a fourth installment of The Hangover would look like.

“Maybe if they made it a Pixar version… a family-friendly version,” he said. “I don’t think anybody has been thinking about that.” </textarea>
