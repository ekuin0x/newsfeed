                <textarea id="text" readonly> Key Takeaways U.S. equities were mixed and little changed, with the S&P 500 up 0.06%, on the shortened Black Friday trading session following the Thanksgiving holiday.

First Solar and SolarEdge Technologies shares lost ground as rising bond yields made solar power stocks less attractive.

Nvidia shares fell on a report it has delayed the launch of a new AI chip designed to comply with new U.S. export rules to China.

U.S. equities were mixed and little changed in the shortened Black Friday session following yesterday’s Thanksgiving holiday. The S&P 500 was up 0.06%. For the week, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were all in positive territory.

Almost all of the stocks in the Dow were higher. Walmart (WMT) shares gained 0.9% and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) added 0.8% as retailers entered the key holiday shopping season.

Amazon (AMZN) shares rose 0.02% on a report European regulators will approve its $1.4 billion acquisition of iRobot (IRBT). iRobot shares soared 39%.

Shares of First Solar (FSLR) and SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) declined 3.3% and 0.8% respectively, as bond yields jumped, making solar power stocks less attractive.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped 1.9% on a report the chipmaker has delayed the launch of an artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductor designed to comply with new White House restrictions on exports to China.

Apple (AAPL) shares dipped 0.7% on a report its smartphone sales in China declined during the country’s recent Singles Day. </textarea>
