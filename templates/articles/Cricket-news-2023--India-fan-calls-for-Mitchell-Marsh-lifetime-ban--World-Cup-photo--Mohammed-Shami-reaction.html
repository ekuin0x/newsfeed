A furious Indian cricket fan has been left so incensed by a viral post-World Cup photo of Mitch Marsh, that he wrote to the Indian Prime Minister calling on him to ban the Aussie all-rounder from the country forever.

The photo of Marsh with his feet crossed on top of the World Cup trophy was snapped in the dressing room following Australia's six-wicket win over the host nation last week.

Posted to X on Monday﻿ by cricket social media identity Mufaddal Vohra with the caption, "Mitchell Marsh with the World Cup", the photo quickly attracted attention and has has now been viewed more than 4.1 million times.

In two letters, one to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and another to the country's sports ministry, the fan said Marsh "disrespected both religious and cultural sentiments of the nation" by "putting his feet on something that Indians consider sacred", according to Indian news site The Quint.

He then called on Modi to block Marsh from ever receiving another visa to enter the country, stating the West Australian be "handed a lifetime ban from cricket" in India.

Marsh was sensational throughout the World Cup, scoring 441 runs at 49, including two centuries against Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Indian fast bowler Mohammed Shami – who ended the World Cup the leading wicket-taker with 24 – told reporters on Friday the image left him feeling "hurt" too.

"The trophy for which all the teams in the world fight, the trophy which you want to lift over your head, keeping a foot on that trophy did not make me happy," he said.

Asked about the photo upon touching down in Melbourne on Monday, Marsh was unaware of the target on his back.

﻿"It's got a bit of legs that photo, hasn't it?" he said.

"Pardon the pun.

"I haven't seen a lot, but there you go."

India was undefeated in the round-robin stage of the tournament before a stunning 137 from Travis Head led the Aussies to a six-wicket win in the final.

Australia's upcoming Test series against Pakistan begins on Thursday, December 14 in Perth. </textarea>
