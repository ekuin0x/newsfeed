                <textarea id="text" readonly> Alabama is headed back to Jordan-Hare Stadium.

The last time the Crimson Tide (10-1, 7-0 SEC) played at Auburn, the Tigers (6-5, 3-4 SEC) held Alabama scoreless for most of regulation before taking it to four overtimes, almost dashing its College Football Playoff dreams — before eventually falling in the Crimson Tide's 24-22 win.

Auburn lost to New Mexico State during Week 12, but Alabama fans know the record isn't indicative of how scary the Tigers can be on the road. Even Miss Terry knows: On the Nov. 9 episode of "The Pat McAfee Show," Nick Saban said Miss Terry's mind has been on Auburn since the win over Ole Miss.

"I wake up on Sunday morning, and she looks at me and says, 'Man, it's gonna be hard playing at Auburn,'" Saban said on the show.

Alabama and quarterback Jalen Milroe have gotten better every week since the beginning of the season. Milroe was responsible for six touchdowns against Kentucky, with three passing and three rushing touchdowns. He threw three passing touchdowns in just over one half of play against Chattanooga.

The Crimson Tide have already clinched a berth in the SEC championship game and is still alive for a potential College Footall Playoff berth. But first things first: the Iron Bowl.

Here's everything you need to know about how to watch Alabama take on Auburn, including time, date, TV and streaming info and more:
