                <textarea id="text" readonly> Bradley Cooper may be doing serious roles at this point in his career, but he’s not opposed to returning to his earlier, more comedic ones.

The multihyphenate stopped by The New Yorker Radio Hour to discuss his film, Maestro. During the podcast appearance, he also opened up about whether or not he would do more “fun” movies again one day.

“I would probably do Hangover IV in an instant,” the filmmaker said. “Just because I love Todd [Phillips], I love Zach [Galifianakis], I love Ed [Helms] so much, I probably would.” When pressed about whether or not that’s coming, Cooper admitted, “I don’t think Todd is ever going to do that.”

While he hasn’t done traditionally funny roles lately, he explained that he is having the most fun of his career right now and doesn’t find the heavier movies he’s been working on recently “exhausting” as many people might.

“There’s nothing more fun that I’ve experienced than Maestro and A Star is Born,” he said. “I wouldn’t do it if it wasn’t.”

Cooper directed, co-wrote and stars in Maestro, opposite Carey Mulligan. He portrays legendary composer Leonard Bernstein, while Mulligan takes on the role of his wife, Felicia Montealegre Cohn Bernstein.

Instead of creating a traditional biopic, the Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese-produced film details Leonard and Felicia’s “very complicated” 30-year relationship, from when they met at a party in 1946, through two engagements and three children.

“Their connection was profound,” Mulligan previously told Vogue. “They lit each other up. You can hear it: There are tapes of them trading anecdotes, and it’s like they’re dancing.”

The marriage, to some, may have seemed unorthodox, as she accepted his affairs with men. But it was only to a certain point.

“For her, the betrayal wasn’t sex,” the Oscar-winning actress said of her character. “It was when she felt someone else intruding into the space she held for him, being the person who understood him, who was necessary.”

Maestro is in theaters now, before hitting Netflix Dec. 20. </textarea>
