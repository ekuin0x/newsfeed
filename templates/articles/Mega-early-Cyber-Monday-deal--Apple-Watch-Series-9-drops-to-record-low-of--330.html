                <textarea id="text" readonly> In what's one of the most surprising (and most welcome) early Cyber Monday deals yet, the Apple Watch Series 9 that was just released in September, is already on sale. This brand-new model is available for just $330 — a whopping $69 off its regular price — and comes with loads of features like WatchOS 10, Precision Finding, and Double Tap that will have fans clamoring for an upgrade. You can grab the deal at Amazon right now.

Is this a good Cyber Monday deal?

Since this is a recent release, there haven't been a lot of sales worth mentioning yet — in fact, this is the first. That makes this the all-time low price on this gadget!

Is an Apple Watch worth it?

If you're in the market for a smartwatch, you can't go wrong with the Series 9. Even the packaging includes everything you need: the Watch face itself, a band, and a charging cable to keep it powered. There are loads of features that make it worth checking out, but some of the best are Fall and Crash detection. It can actually alert authorities if you've been in an accident — how cool is that?

Pair that with other advanced health features like monitoring your blood oxygen level, taking ECGs and even tracking your sleep patterns, and you have a device that feels fine-tuned to help keep you healthy. It's also a great workout companion and can track your steps taken, along with a lot of other workouts. Did we mention it comes with three months of Apple Fitness+ for free? That's another $30 value.

The new build makes it both the fastest and brightest Apple Watch yet. It even responds to gesture controls. You can take calls straight from the watch, and you can customize the face to fit your personal style.

How does the Series 9 compare to the Apple Watch Ultra 2? Easy: it's better. The Ultra 2 is larger, bulkier and, yes, tougher — but it's a relatively small upgrade over the original Ultra, where the Series 9 has a lot of features that put it on par with the Ultra 2 while also being more suitable for people with smaller wrists. That, and the price difference — the Series 9 is $330, while the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is more than $700.

The Apple Watch 9 is sleek, powerful, stylish — and on sale. (Amazon)

What reviewers say

"My first time wearing it was this morning during an hour-long workout and the results were amazing. It recorded my blood pressure. My music was playing. I even received text messages while I was working out. I still have other features to check out, but so far I am amazed," one fan raved.

"I love my new watch," another fan said. "The battery life is better and the color is beautiful."

One customer warned that you should make sure to update your phone first. "Only issue I had was to make sure I updated to iOS 17 or your watch won't pair. I love the new faces (Snoopy) and the durability. I am replacing the AppleWatch 4 (40 mm) and able to use all my old bands. I got the 41 mm. Highly recommended!"

Walmart Beautiful 6-Quart Air Fryer $69 $90 Save $21 With its 6-quart capacity, this gorgeous air fryer can hold enough food for five to seven people, yet its small footprint won't take up too much space on your counter. Its patent-pending TurboCrisp technology helps ensure quick, even cooking with that crunch factor we all crave (though you'll be able to cook with as much as 75% less fat than deep-frying). The user-friendly touchscreen lights up while in use and features time and temperature settings (from 90-400 degrees Fahrenheit), as well as four functions: Air Fry, Roast, Reheat and Dehydrate, the latter of which is a cool feature that isn't always included with air fryers. $69 at Walmart
