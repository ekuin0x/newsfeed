                <textarea id="text" readonly> The No. 11 Alabama Crimson Tide (5-1) will try to extend their four-game winning streak when they host the Arkansas Razorbacks (2-4) on Saturday afternoon. Alabama is coming off back-to-back road wins at Mississippi State and Texas A&M, sitting alone atop the SEC West standings. Arkansas has lost four straight games, including a 27-20 setback at then-No. 16 Ole Miss last week. The Razorbacks came up short in a 49-26 final when these teams met last year.

Kickoff is set for noon ET on Saturday at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Ala. The Tide are favored by 19.5 points in the latest Arkansas vs. Alabama odds, while the over/under is set at 45 points, per SportsLine consensus.

Why Alabama can cover

Alabama has been dominant in this rivalry, winning 16 straight games while scoring at least 41 points in the last seven meetings. The Crimson Tide have covered the spread at a 16-4-1 clip in their last 21 home games, while Arkansas has lost 20 of its last 24 road games. Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe racked up a career-high 321 passing yards in last week's win, with wide receiver Jermaine Burton catching nine passes for 197 yards and two touchdowns.

Despite some early-season struggles, Alabama has covered the spread in four of its six games and is heading toward another SEC West title. Arkansas has been unable to overcome a defense that has allowed at least 34 points in three of its last four games, leading to a four-game losing skid. The Crimson Tide rarely struggle against bad teams, going 10-2-1 against the spread in their last 13 games against teams with losing records. See which team to pick here.

Why Arkansas can cover

Arkansas has covered the spread in both road games, losing by three to LSU and seven to Ole Miss, as a double-digit underdog. The Razorbacks have scored 61 points over the past two games with Bama, but they allowed 91. The Arkansas offense can be potent with quarterback KJ Jefferson running the show. The senior has at least 245 passing yards in four of six games and has completed 67% of his throws. He has 1,300 yards and 12 TD passes for the season.

Running back Raheim Sanders, a first-team All-SEC selection last year, saw limited action last week after injuring a knee in the opener. He should be used more Saturday, and he rushed for 101 yards in last year's meeting. Backfield mate AJ Green is averaging 6.1 yards per carry. The Tide haven't been dominant this season, and Milroe has thrown four interceptions in five starts and has been sacked 21 times. The Razorbacks defense has 16 sacks and 11 takeaways.
