                <textarea id="text" readonly> Thomas Hand thought his daughter Emily was killed in Hamas’ October 7 attacks, but she is listed among the Israeli hostages released by Hamas late Saturday.

Hand, who told CNN's Clarissa Ward of the news before it was officially announced by Israel, said he was bringing his 9-year-old daughter's dog, Johnny, to Israel and Egypt's border Saturday. He said he planned to meet Emily there when the Red Cross convoy arrived.

Hand said he has been living in a period of anguish and hope.

He was initially told Emily had died. Weeks later, Israeli officials told him that they’re not sure Emily was killed, as they had not located her body and didn’t find any blood in the home where she was sleeping.

She turned 9 in captivity, Hand, who is a single parent after his wife died of cancer, previously told CNN.

He told CNN Saturday he hopes this will be the first step toward Emily's recovery and is aware of the long road she has ahead to heal after being in captivity for nearly 50 days. </textarea>
