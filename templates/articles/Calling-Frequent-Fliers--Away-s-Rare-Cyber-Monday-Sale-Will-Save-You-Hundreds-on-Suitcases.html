                <textarea id="text" readonly> Come Cyber Monday weekend we know that big brand retailers will have their best markdowns of the year. But for more niche brands, discounts are no guarantee. That’s why we’re excited about Away’s huge Cyber Monday savings on all suitcases.

Love it or hate it, it’s the time of year for traveling. But braving the airport is much easier with smartly designed luggage in tow. Away’s suitcases are loved by customers for their lightweight design and ease of use during hectic onboarding. However, high-end luggage is an investment, so some savvy shopping, like waiting until this weekend to shop at a discounted rate, will save your wallet. Away has 20 percent off on all its suitcases this Cyber Monday weekend—from carry-ons to large luggage.

Away’s The Carry-On

Away

Forgoing a checked bag in favor of fitting everything in a carry-on is the traveling ideal. Away’s suitcase was chosen as our “Best Overall” carry-on option and comes in three styles. The Classic Carry-On is Away’s smallest suitcase, weighing only 7.9 pounds empty with a 21.7-inch by 14.4-inch by 9-inch exterior (fitting about five to seven outfits, according to the brand), and fits in most overhead compartments. The slightly larger, Bigger Carry-On is slightly bigger (housing six to nine outfits) and is great for longer trips. However, who hasn’t gone on a trip and returned with a suitcase noticeably fuller than when you arrived? For those times, the Bigger Carry-On Flex expands to add an additional 2.25 inches of space.

There’s no last-minute panic walking up to the bag check hoping that your meticulously stuffed carry-on will be allowed on the plane with you. Away has tested its carry-ons in airports in the U.S. and London and determined that its classic Carry-On is accepted by 41 airlines from all over the world, and the Bigger Carry-On is by 28 airlines.

Away’s The Medium Suitcase

Away

For checked bags, The Medium and Large suitcases are designed for more than a weekend getaway, and the luggage fits enough for over two weeks abroad. All of Away’s suitcases come with TSA-approved locks, 360-degree wheels, and underside grab handles, all of which are housed on the suitcase’s durable shell. Also on sale are Away’s aluminum editions, which are available in three sizes, Carry-On, Medium, and Large, and feature a double aluminum shiny shell in rose gold, silver, or onyx black.

The celebrity-loved luggage brand’s rare sale is a can’t-miss. Purchase your new favorite suitcase for 20 percent off at away.com this Cyber Monday weekend.
