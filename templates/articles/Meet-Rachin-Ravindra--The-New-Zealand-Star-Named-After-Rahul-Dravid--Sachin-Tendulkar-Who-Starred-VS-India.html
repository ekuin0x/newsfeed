KEY HIGHLIGHTS Rachin Ravindra starred against India

Rachin made a knock of 75

Rachin is of Indian origin

New Zealand posed a tough challenge to the Indian bowling unit in the top-of-table clash of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 on Sunday (October 23) at the Himichal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) Stadium in Dharamshala, with Rachin Ravindra and Daryl Mitchell leading the way with a marathon partnership for the third wicket.

Ravindra is the big story of the day, as he is an Indian-origin player who has made things hard for Rohit Sharma and Co. in the big clash. The all-rounder's father, Ravi Krishnamurthy, is a software architect from Bengaluru who migrated to New Zealand and settled down in the country. Ravi also played a lot of club cricket in India and is a close friend of Javagal Srinath.

Who is Rachin Ravindra?

Ravindra's father took his passion for cricket to New Zealand and founded the Hutt Hawks Cricket Club. The love for the sport was evident in naming his son 'Rachin', which is inspired by two of his favorite cricketers, Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar, with the 'RA' being inspired by Dravid and the 'Chin' from Tendulkar.

Rachin was not meant to be a regular starter in the World Cup for New Zealand, but an injury to Michael Bracewell opened up a place in the squad for the 20-year-old as they went searching for another spin-bowling all-rounder. The injury problems for Kane Williamson presented him with a golden chance to bat at number three.

Rachin made a big mark on the tournament by scoring a century in the opening game of the tournament against England in what was his World Cup. He followed it up with a half-century in the second game against the Netherlands, which confirmed his place in the playing XI even when Williamson returned against Bangladesh, only to get injured again.

Rachin was first spotted on the big stage when he played in the U-19 World Cup in 2016, which also featured Rishabh Pant and Ishan Kishan. He also featured in the 2018 edition, which was won by a Shubman Gill-starred Indian team.

Rachin made his international debut in 2021 in a T20I game against Bangladesh. His test debut came on Indian soil in November 2021, where he took advantage of a memorable last-wicket batting stand that helped the Kiwis seal a memorable draw in Kanpur.

Rachin made his ODI debut earlier this year, in March 2023, against Sri Lanka.

Rachin's knock against India ended with an innings of 75 in 87 balls with a 159-run partnership. </textarea>
