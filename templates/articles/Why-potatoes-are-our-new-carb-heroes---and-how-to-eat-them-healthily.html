                <textarea id="text" readonly> Both the skin and the flesh of potatoes are good for us, which is why eating both is the healthiest way. “The skin is a great source of fibre, whereas most of the vitamins and minerals are found in the flesh,” Dr Mellor says. Overcooking potatoes (or storing them for a long time ) can lead to loss of vitamin C. “And chopping or dicing potatoes up small and boiling them in water can mean that they leach or lose minerals to the water, especially potassium,” he says.

The healthiest way to cook potatoes is to boil or bake them in their skins, says registered nutritionist Kerry Torrens, but there are pros and cons to both. “Boiled ones lose some of their potassium content in the cooking water and baked ones have a higher GI (glycaemic index).”

This refers to how quickly food affects your blood sugar level as spikes in blood sugar over the long term can potentially cause inflammation and metabolic disorders. If Torrens had to choose the best way to eat potatoes, it would be boiled in their skins and left to cool, in order to benefit from the resistant starch. “As long as you don’t coat the cooled potatoes in mayo, this way of eating them is good news for your waistline, blood sugar levels and gut health,” she says.

Is there any truth in the widely held belief that eating potatoes causes weight gain? It’s not altogether true, at least not according to some studies. In 2016, scientists at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark found no “convincing evidence” to link obesity, Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease with mashed, boiled or baked potatoes.

Unsurprisingly, they did find that French fries “may be associated” with an increased risk of obesity and Type 2 diabetes, but added that further research would be needed.

Some research even suggests that eating potatoes can help with weight management. A study published last year in the Journal of Medicinal Food found that boiled potatoes are more filling than other starchy foods such as bread and rice and may actually be helpful in maintaining a healthy weight.

The bottom line is that potatoes contain nutrients that are good for us, and they can be enjoyed as part of a healthy diet. But remember to eat lots of other vegetables, too. “It’s always best to have a variety of plant-based foods, including starch rich foods such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice, pasta and cereals,” Dr Mellor says. </textarea>
