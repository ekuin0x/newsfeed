                <textarea id="text" readonly> With entertainment and comics convention CCXP in Sao Paolo, Brazil attracting huge audiences and having grown in importance, Paramount Global‘s Paramount+ is set to bring such powerhouse content brands as Halo, Star Trek: Discovery, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, The Thundermans Return and Drag Race: Brazil to the event’s 2023 edition.

As one of the largest pop culture festivals in the world, CCXP in Brazil attracted more than 280,000 people in 2022, according to the organizers. This year’s event runs Nov. 30-Dec. 3.

“Connecting with our audiences and immersing our fans in the rich universes of our unrivaled content and characters is a top priority for Paramount+,” said Marco Nobili, executive vp and international general manager, Paramount+. “CCXP in Brazil is an exceptionally captivating fan event on a global scale, and we believe there’s no better platform to do just that. We’re set to showcase some of our biggest franchises with sensational fandoms across sci-fi, reality and kids and family, featuring appearances by both global and local Paramount+ stars.”

“Alongside exclusive, never-before-seen content and other surprises, fans can expect appearances by global and local Paramount+ stars and visit larger-than-life interactive activations on the expo floor,” Paramount+ said on Monday. During a panel session on the Thunder Stage on Saturday, Dec. 2, hosted by Brazilian stars Hugo Gloss and Nicole Bahls, the streamer will present first looks at key titles and insight from their stars and creatives.

Among the featured hits and talent unveiled will be: Halo season 2: Pablo Schreiber (“Master Chief”), Joseph Morgan (“James Ackerson”), David Wiener (showrunner and executive producer), and Kiki Wolfkill (executive producer); Star Trek: Discovery’s fifth and final season: Sonequa Martin-Green (“Captain Michael Burnham”) and Michelle Paradise (co-showrunner and executive producer); The Thundermans Return: Kira Kosarin (“Phoebe Thunderman”) and Jack Griffo (“Max Thunderman”); Drag Race: Brazil: Grag Queen (host) and queens Aquarela, Betina Polaroid, Dallas de Vil, Diva More, Hellena Malditta, Melusine Sparkle, Miranda Lebrão, Naza, Organzza, Rubi Ocean, Shannon Skarllet and Tristan Soledade.

Meanwhile, on the CCXP floor, Paramount+ will offer such interactive experiences and themed photo opportunities as Halo‘s “UNSC Spartan Recruitment Training Center,” Star Trek: Discovery’s “Captain on the Bridge,” and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem‘s “Master Splinter’s Ultimate Drill.”

Last year, Paramount’s CCXP presence included panels on Teen Wolf: The Movie with stars Shelley Hennig and Colton Haynes, as well as Wolf Pack with Brazilian star Rodrigo Santoro. </textarea>
