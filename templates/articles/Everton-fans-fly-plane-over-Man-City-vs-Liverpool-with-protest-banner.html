                <textarea id="text" readonly> Everton fans paid for a plane to carry a banner criticising the Premier League to be blown over the Etihad Stadium during Manchester City's top-of-the-table clash with Liverpool

Everton have protested against the Premier League's decision to hand them a 10-point deduction by flying a banner over the Etihad Stadium during Manchester City vs Liverpool.

The plane went over the stadium in the second half, with a banner reading: "Premier League = corrupt. #UTFT #EFC". Sky Sports did not show the plane on their coverage.

The Premier League handed out the biggest points deduction in the competition's history last week due to an alleged breach of profit and sustainability rules. The punishment knocked Everton down to 19th place, two points away from safety. The club said it was "shocked and disappointed" by the "wholly disproportionate and unjust sporting sanction" imposed and Everton fans have since vowed to "take the fight" to the Premier League.

Everton fan group The 1878s decided to use the City vs Liverpool game due to the massive global audience and due to the fact that their game against Manchester United at 4.30pm on Sunday will be played in the dark.

Nevertheless, there will still be a protest outside Goodison Park on Sunday, with banners and cards being handed out to fans to display. Supporters are also being encouraged to boo the Premier League anthem before kick-off, while a chant alleging corruption is expected in the 10th minute.

‌Dave Kelly, who is chair of the Everton Fan Advisory Board, said: “That’s the message of the meeting - this isn’t an Everton Football Club issue - this is a football issue, because this concerns clubs across the Premier League, and all football clubs across the country.

‌“We will show a worldwide audience on Sunday the Premier League has picked on the wrong club in Everton, and the wrong place in Goodison Park. But this is just the first page and first chapter of what will be an extremely long book, we won’t be going anywhere, any time soon - we want to get football back on the straight and narrow, and that means real change at the Premier League.

‌“We will keep this going all the way through to the end of the appeal against the sanction. And we will go through right to next year on a war footing - with fans from across the country coming together - to fight for change and justice.”

Everton manager Sean Dyche told reporters: "I was shocked and seemingly, the wave of noise after that, most people around football were shocked. On the other hand, it doesn't change the focus. The focus since I got here was turning things around on the pitch. We were obviously on the right lines for that and this has given us a push backwards. The job hasn't changed for me."

Pep Guardiola, whose have also been charged by the Premier League for 115 alleged breaches of their FFP rules, said: "I'm not going to say one word about Everton because I don't know the reality of what happened. They are two completely different cases."
