                <textarea id="text" readonly> The OnePlus 11 comes in just 2 standard colorways - however, the brand has just confirmed the addition of a third for its "ten-year" successor. The 12 is also now believed to echo forebears from further back in its OEM's history by offering the option to protect any of these three finishes with a custom wood (or wood-effect) case.

OnePlus is said to deliver some serious fan service with its choice of first-party cases for its next flagship smartphone. According to the leaker Digital Chat Station, its DNA will be instantly recognizable thanks to its wood-grain finish.

Accordingly, it might remind some enthusiasts of those designed for its distant forebear the 3, not to mention the limited-edition Bamboo StyleSwap cover for the OG OnePlus One. The 12 is projected to look very different from either even in wood, though, with a large off-center rear panel hump packed with Hasselblad-tuned camera tech, with matching logo.

As for the glass that might hide beneath this wooden shell, OnePlus has officially announced that there will be 3. Black and green return as "gifts from the 10 Pro", joined by the white that could have been inspired by another OnePlus One limited edition.

The company has yet to mention whether all 3 options will be available internationally, or if some might be regional exclusives. Nevertheless, the 12 is now thoroughly backed to launch as its brand's 10th anniversary flagship in early December 2023.
