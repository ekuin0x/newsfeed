                <textarea id="text" readonly> In a bid to end their long wait for the title, Australia and Italy will go head-to-head in the Davis Cup 2023 final at the Martin Carpena Arena in Malaga, Spain on Sunday.

The AUS vs ITA tennis tie in the Davis Cup 2023 final will be available on live streaming and telecast in India. The tie will start at 8:30 PM IST.

Australia are the second most successful nation in the Davis Cup tennis tournament with 28 titles, only behind the USA’s 32. However, their last triumph came in 2003.

Australia eased into the Davis Cup 2023 final with a commanding 2-0 win over Finland on Friday in Malaga.

Alex de Minaur, 12th in the ATP rankings, and Alexei Popyrin, world No. 40, won their matches to seal the tie early. Lleyton Hewitt, who played in Australia's last Davis Cup win 20 years ago, is also in the team but as a non-playing captain. An in-form Matthew Ebden, the current partner of Rohan Bopanna on the ATP circuit, leads the Australian challenge in doubles.

However, Australia will face Jannik Sinner’s Italy in Sunday's final. Sinner defeated Serbia’s Novak Djokovic in the semi-final on Saturday and is the No. 4 ranked tennis player in the world.

Italy enter the final on the back of an impressive 2-1 win over a highly-rated Serbian side. Serbia’s Miomir Kecmanovic defeated Lorenzo Musetti in the first match of the tie before Novak Djokovic was stunned by Jannik Sinner in a similar fashion.

Jannik Sinner teamed up with Lorenzo Sonego in the deciding doubles contest to defeat Novak Djokovic and Miomir Kecmanovic in straight sets and take the 1976 champions into the Davis Cup final for the first time since 1998.

However, Australia, who have possessed well-rounded teams historically, lead Italy 8-4 in Davis Cup head-to-head records.
