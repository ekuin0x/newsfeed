                <textarea id="text" readonly> It’s no secret that a lot of players didn’t like the way Starfield’s dialogue camera worked, which had also a lot of bugs. Well, good news everyone. Modder “AntoniX” released a mod that gets rid of it completely.

With this mod, players can now use a more traditional third-person camera in conversations. The mod also offers a first-person mode. Plus, it looks like you can move around freely during your chats. As such, the game will now be more immersive.

To show what this mod does, AntoniX posted the following video. I suggest watching it because it’ll give you an idea of what the mod does. And yes, it seems to be an improvement compared to what Bethesda originally had. At least, that’s what I think.

If you are interested in it, you can go ahead and download it from this link. Do note that you’ll also need the Starfield Script Extender (SFSE).

Speaking of Starfield, we’ve got some other cool mods to recommend. Last month, we talked about a mod that added new landscape discovery quests. We also shared a mod that adds physics collisions to all the dead bodies in the game. In September, we also shared the Disk Cache Enabler Mod, which helps reduce how much space the game uses on your computer. Don’t forget to check out Starfield HD Overhaul and Starfield HD Reworked . And then we have this mod that brings photorealistic eyes to all characters.

Sprinting Stuttering Fix is another cool mod that stops the annoying stutters when you run. Then, you can grab this mod that makes the game run smoother by fixing a bunch of scripts. And don’t forget these two must-have mods that make the game look and feel better with a new User Interface and cooler Particle Effects. On the other hand, this mod lets you travel between planets in real-time. Oh, and let’s not forget this mod that brings a dynamic weather system into the game, as well as this mod that aims to improve the behavior of NPCs.

Have fun!
