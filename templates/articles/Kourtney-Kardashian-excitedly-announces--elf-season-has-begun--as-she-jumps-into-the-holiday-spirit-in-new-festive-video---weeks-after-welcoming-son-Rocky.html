                <textarea id="text" readonly> Kourtney Kardashian excitedly declared that 'elf season has begun' while decorating her home for the holiday season in a new video shared to her Instagram stories on Monday.

The Poosh founder, 44 - who recently stayed home with husband Travis Barker and their newborn son Rocky for Thanksgiving - gave a quick glimpse of a special tradition that her family enjoys during Christmas.

The TV personality filmed a cardboard sled that had Elf on the Shelf dolls taped to paper plates to make it appear as if they were sliding down.

She added a festive, instrumental tune in the background of the reel and typed out to her fans and followers 'elf season has begun.'

Next to the 'elf sledding' was a large, green Christmas tree filled with glowing lights, but has yet to be filled with ornaments.

The reality star appears to be a big fan of the holiday, and notably hosted the annual Kardashian-Jenner Christmas Eve party last year.

She was joined by her family, including her husband and his own children. Other celebrity guess were also in attendance, such as Chandelier singer, Sia.

Kris Jenner also followed the Elf on the Shelf theme, and uploaded a clip to her own Instagram stories earlier on Monday.

She filmed the short video by showing an assortment of elf dolls that were designated for her 13 grandchildren, including Kourtney and Travis' newborn baby boy, Rocky Thirteen.

The star could be heard saying, 'It took me a few minutes to get this in order, but look at what I have from Elf on the Shelf!'

'How cute is this?' Kris asked as she showed each doll placed inside a small container that had each grandchildren's name also on the front.

Jenner concluded the video by expressing, 'I think it's time! Thank you Elf on the Shelf. This is so cute.'

She then showed a pile of sticker books that will also be given to her grandchildren and exclaimed, 'Merry Christmas!'

While some of her family members - including sisters Kendall and Kylie as well as ex Scott Disick - spent Thanksgiving in Palm Springs with Kris Jenner, the Poosh founder notably stayed home with the Blink-182 drummer and their baby boy.

However, the couple hosted their own intimate celebration and the reality star shared a glimpse of the night on social media.

The beauty showed an ornately, set table that had a fall-themed, floral display in the middle and also a variety of candles.

She also put on a previous Thanksgiving dinner in celebration of her husband's 48th birthday, which included vegan options followed by a screening of the new Thanksgiving horror flick.

Earlier this month, Kourtney welcomed her baby boy, Rocky Thirteen, to the world, but a source recently informed the The U.S. Sun that some of her family have yet to officially meet the little one.

'Kourtney is going to be introducing the new baby to her family on an 'invite-only' basis,' the insider explained.

'[Kourtney] and Travis have communicated that they will be taking 'family only' time for the newly blended family and for Kourt to rest, and then they will be inviting the extended family over on an individual basis.'

The star also shares Mason, 13, Penelope, 11, and Reign, eight, with ex, Scott Disick. And Barker shares son Landon, 20, and daughter Alabama, 17, with Shanna Moakler.

The source later added, 'Kourtney has said it's a germs thing - to protect the baby and not expose him to any risk - but it's, like, part of her new strategy to keep everyone at arm's length.'

During a recent episode of The Kardashians, the Poosh founder admitted she and Travis were 'not trying' when she got pregnant this year.

She revealed that she and her husband conceived their baby about a year after they gave up on IVF treatments.

The star also confessed that they conceived their child - who was reportedly born earlier this month - on Valentine's Day, and she was not tracking her ovulation at that point.

On the show, she spoke about how she surprised her family with the news, and also opened up about the truth behind the ingenious idea of announcing her pregnancy to the public at the Blink-182 concert over the summer.

'It happened on Valentine's Day,' Kourtney explained to her family after breaking the news to them at their office.

A producer then asked her in a confessional, 'You know when it happened?'

Kourtney responded, 'Yeah, of course. I mean, people would always say to us, "The second you stop trying it's just gonna happen."'

'We stopped doing IVF maybe two months before our wedding, so it took a year, I think, for all of those hormones and chemicals to get out of my system,' she explained.

'We were not trying whatsoever,' she said. 'I didn't even check my ovulation anymore.

'We decided to put it in God's hands,' she added. 'I thought it was just not happening, and we were, like, accepting of it, and then, God's plan.'

The producer said in realization: 'What, so you've been pregnant all season?'

Kourtney then confirms that she has known 'the whole season' as the show plays a sequence of flashback scenes with clues.

'I mean, it truly feels like a miracle, being able to be pregnant and have a baby with the love of my life,' she gushed. </textarea>
