                <textarea id="text" readonly> An expert Pokemon Go trainer has taught other players how to achieve the “impossible” excellent throw when trying to capture Scatterbug.

Poke Ball throwing is an essential part of the Pokemon Go experience, yet not every throw ends with a successful capture. This is where the excellent throw comes into play, which users can attempt to perform when on the hunt.

The action should prove simple enough. Players need only to hold down on the Poke Ball and wait for a circle to appear around the mon. Once the circle begins pulsing, the goal is to throw the Poke Ball dead in the circle’s center.

To nail the Scatterbug throw, a 45-degree throw released to the left of the pulsing circle is a must. Players should try releasing it “almost exactly in line” with the creature.

Aiming even a little too low will result in the ball hitting the ground. Of course, throwing too high will cause the Poke Ball to miss the circle entirely.

Others were especially impressed by the video’s presentation, with one user writing, “Your presentation and narration are what elevates this from just stupid to literal art.”

Hopefully, more players will have an easier time securing Scatterbug with an excellent throw.
