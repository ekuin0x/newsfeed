                <textarea id="text" readonly> On becoming more of a leader...

We felt – me, Virgil and the other guys, Robbo, Ali – that we need to really take a step forward and just try to handle everything – Trent, for sure, he's still young anyway! – to make everybody feel [at] home and just have a good group. I think the group is fantastic. The players are nice and have very good personalities. They just want to work hard and they just want to achieve stuff, which is a good thing. We try to help them. They need to help themselves and I'm sure they watch us [in] what we're doing and just try to learn.

On his relationship with Darwin Nunez...

I think because he saw that I'm always looking at him when he's running and [I'm] just trying to give him assists, try to give him balls, he's always trying his best to give me the ball back. I think because we are both fast and we both have speed, it makes us understand each other's game.

But also when Cody plays in that position, he's a fantastic guy. If you understand their game, your game is going to be easier. So I'm trying always to understand the other players' games, so I know where I could be in that position with this player and with other players it's different. Kostas and Robbo [are] completely different, Darwin and Cody are also different. So I have to adapt with the players who are going to play and who's where. </textarea>
