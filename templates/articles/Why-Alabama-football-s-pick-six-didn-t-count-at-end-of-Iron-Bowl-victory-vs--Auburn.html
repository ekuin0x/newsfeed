                <textarea id="text" readonly> Terrion Arnold sealed Alabama football's comeback victory vs. Auburn in the Iron Bowl on Saturday with an interception â€” one that he seemed to return all the way for a touchdown.

While Arnold celebrated his would-be pick-six in Jordan-Hare Stadium's end zone following the game-ending play, however, officials reviewed it. Though it had no affect on the outcome, they determined he ultimately did not score a touchcown, which would have given Alabama a 33-24 win. After the touchdown was reversed, it gave the Crimson Tide its ultimate 27-24 win over Auburn in the Iron Bowl.

Officials determined Arnold stepped out at the 3-yard line after being tackled by Auburn running back Jarquez Hunter. The pick by Arnold was perhaps the easiest of his college career, as the throw by Auburn quarterback Payton Thorne fell directly into the cornerback's lap as the clock hit all zeroes:

Arnold and the Crimson Tide (11-1, 8-0 in SEC play) will not pay any mind to the loss of six points on the board due to the ruling. A win by the Crimson Tide keeps it in the running for the College Football Playoff, as no two-loss team has ever made the postseason. Alabama will have a shot at No. 1 Georgia in the SEC championship game, but will have time to take a deep breath after the wild Week 13 ending against Auburn.

The Iron Bowl has seen plenty of unbelievable finishes in its history, and the 2023 edition retained that shining quality. On a seemingly impossible fourth-and-goal, Crimson Tide quarterback Jalen Milroe found Isaiah Bond in the corner of the end zone for a 31-yard touchdown, putting Alabama up by three.

On the Tigers' ensuing offensive drive with just 30 seconds remaining, Thorne was strip-sacked, resulting in a loss of 14 yards to the 1-yard line. With the clock ticking down, Thorne quickly got rid of the ball but threw it straight to Arnold as Alabama fans rejoiced that their College Football Playoff hopes remain very much alive. </textarea>
