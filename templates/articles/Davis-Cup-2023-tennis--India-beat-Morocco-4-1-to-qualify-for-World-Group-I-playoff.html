                <textarea id="text" readonly> The Indian tennis team defeated Morocco 4-1 in its Davis Cup 2023 World Group II tie at the Vijayant Khand Mini Stadium in Gomti Nagar, Lucknow, on Sunday.

With the scores tied at 1-1 after Saturday’s tennis matches, Rohan Bopanna, playing his last Davis Cup match, led the Indian charge on the second day. Bopanna and Yuki Bhambri won the doubles tie to give India the lead before Sumit Nagal sealed the tie for India.

Digvijay Pratap Singh also won the fifth match to sweeten the scoreline.

The first match of day 2 was an emotional affair for fans as Rohan Bopanna, the grand old man of Indian tennis, stepped onto the court for his last Davis Cup match. He teamed up with Yuki Bhambri for a doubles contest against Elliot Benchetrit-Younes Lalami Laaroussi.

Rohan Bopanna, ranked 7th in the doubles ATP rankings, and Yuki Bhambri, ranked 65th, dominated Elliot Benchetrit, ranked 808th, and Younes Lalami Laaroussi, ranked 1010th, to win the match 6-2, 6-1, handing India a 2-1 lead.

A cross-court drop brought an end to Bopanna's 21-year long Davis Cup career. The veteran waved to the crowd, shook hands with every member of the Indian team. He walked around the court wrapped in an Indian flag, waving his hands, blowing kisses at fans in every stand.

In the second match of the day, Sumit Nagal, the highest-ranked Indian men’s singles player at 156, went up against world No. 557 Yassine Dlimi of Morocco. Sumit Nagal easily won his match 6-3, 6-3 to make the scoreline 3-1 in India’s favour.

Sumit Nagal showcased some aggressive tennis and hardly allowed Dlimi to get a foothold in the contest.

In the fifth match of the tie, a dead rubber, Digvijay Pratap Singh, stepping in for the injured Sasikumar Mukund, scored a hard-fought 6-1, 5-7, 10-6 victory over Walid Ahouda.

On Day 1, Sasikumar Mukund was forced to retire against Yassine Dlimi due to an injury but Sumit Nagal restored parity with a win over Adam Moundir.

This victory against Morocco qualifies the Indian tennis team for the World Group I playoffs, scheduled for February next year. A win in that tie can lead India back to Davis Cup World Group I.
