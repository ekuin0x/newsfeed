                <textarea id="text" readonly> Manchester United , Chelsea and Arsenal all have key players facing the risk of a ban ahead of their next Premier League fixtures. Several stars currently sit on four bookings for the 2023-24 campaign, with another yellow card meaning an automatic one-match ban.

Players who have been booked four times this season will walk on a tightrope over the next few weeks. They still have seven matches until a fifth booking no longer results in a ban. After each club’s 19th Premier League game, players will only face a ban if they are booked 10 times before matchweek 32.

United captain Bruno Fernandes is one of those stars. The Portuguese midfielder plays on the edge of the rulebook but will need to be careful over the next few weeks, with Erik ten Hag relying on his key man to remain available.

If Fernandes is booked during Sunday’s clash with Everton, he will miss a big game against Newcastle a week later. Alternatively, a booking against the Magpies would mean he misses the visit of Chelsea on December 6. </textarea>
