                <textarea id="text" readonly> Going into Survivor Series last night (Sat., Nov. 25, 2023) in Chicago, the story of the women’s War Games match largely centered around whether or not Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynch could get along, and what it could mean for their team if they couldn’t. In the end, they hugged it out and went and won the match.

It was a pretty cool moment.

When asked about their history and the future at the post-show press conference, they both got emotional:

Becky: “I think that’s a good point. We have made a lot of history individually but I think the most history that we’ve made has been together, and probably the best history that we’ve made.” Charlotte: “I just think we bring out the best in each other. Tonight, when we hugged at the same time, you could feel that electricity. I wouldn’t be where I am today if it wasn’t for her and she wouldn’t be where she is if it wasn’t for me. So, I think that just never goes away.”

It was just a couple years ago we were getting reports of backstage altercations between the two and allegations of shooting in the ring during segments. Now, they’re back and looking better than ever.

Perhaps a run in the tag team division beckons? </textarea>
