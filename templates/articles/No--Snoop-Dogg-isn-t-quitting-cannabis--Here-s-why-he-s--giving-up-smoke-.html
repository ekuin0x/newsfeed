                <textarea id="text" readonly> Snoop Dogg isn't giving up the kind of "smoke" he's been associated with for much of his career.

The rapper and entrepreneur's statement shocked fans Thursday after he posted a black-and-white social media post, announcing: "After much consideration & conversation with my family, I've decided to give up smoke. Please respect my privacy at this time."

"I'm giving up smoke," he added in the caption.

Snoop did not clarify whether the smoke was related to cannabis or something else, until now. The rapper announced Monday that he is partnering with Solo Stove, a smokeless fire pit brand.

‚ÄúI love a good fire outside but the smoke was too much. Solo Stove fixed fire and took out the smoke. They changed the game and now I‚Äôm excited to spread the love and stay warm with my friends and family,‚Äù Snoop said in a press release.

Under this partnership, the business mogul is the official "smokesman" for the brand and will be releasing a collaboration on Monday at 4:20 p.m. EDT available exclusively at solostove.com and goingsmokeless.com.

But a few users wondered whether Snoop was being serious.

"Define... smoke," actor Lamorne Morris wrote under Snoop's Instagram post, while user @ambie02 asked, "Is it April Fool's Day?"

In subsequent posts, Snoop referred to ‚Äì but didn't clarify ‚Äì his vow to quit smoking. A couple of hours after his initial post, he posted a selfie with the caption "Respect my privacy üí™üèæüôèüèæ" followed by another selfie post the next day that simply included a gust of air emoji in the caption. In the slightly blurry photo, Snoop is looking off to the side.

After Snoop's unexpected announcement on Thursday, many commenters ‚Äì including Queen Latifah, Jhen√© Aiko and Maya Rudolph ‚Äì showed their support for him in the comments. "You got this, Unc!!" Aiko wrote. Venezuelan singer and rapper Micro TDH chimed in, "Not smoking it‚Äôs the new smoking."

His announcement came just hours after his product launch with Martha Stewart of their "Best Buds Bags."

According to Snoop's statement to hip-hop music magazine The Source, the limited edition crossbody bag has "got it all. From my favorite lighter, favorite color, and dime-sized secret stash pockets to stash my favorite herbs." The two also collaborated on a lighter collection that will debut next year, per The Source.

The "Gin and Juice" rapper has long made mentions of marijuana in his music and has several businesses in the cannabis industry. He has a branded line of weed, Leafs by Snoop, and he joined the cannabis investment fund Casa Verde. Under that partnership, he launched a collaboration with TSUMo Snacks in 2022 to create Snazzle Os, cannabis-infused onion ring chips.
