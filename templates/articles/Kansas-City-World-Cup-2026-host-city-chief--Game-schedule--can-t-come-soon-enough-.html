                <textarea id="text" readonly> The next World Cup is less than three years away, yet several lingering questions remain about the historic event coming to the United States, Mexico and Canada – even as news continues to break about plans for the tournament all the way through 2034.

We know which cities in 2026 will host games, but we don’t know which games or how many. There have been reports of disputes threatening to derail plans for some host cities, while FIFA has remained mostly silent on those issues.

To fill some of those blanks and find out how the World Cup preparation process is going in the smallest 2026 host city, The Athletic spoke with Katherine Holland, executive director of the city’s World Cup host city committee. In it, she discussed what she can and can’t plan without a game schedule, how Kansas City will develop a transportation plan, and the city’s stadium, Arrowhead Stadium – best known as the home of the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs.

Questions and answers have been edited for clarity.

How are things going with planning for the World Cup?

They’re going well. If you’ve spoken to other host cities, I think everyone’s in a different state of planning right now. I think that we are perhaps slightly behind, if you will, some other host cities in some respects, and then ahead in other respects. We’ve got a key series of meetings with FIFA in early December, and I think all of us are collectively hopeful that we come out of that with some information that will help us really propel through the next phase of planning.

Kansas City, specifically, we are still working on operationalizing the entity (and) securing access to some funding that we have in place. But as you can imagine, when there’s public funding involved, it’s a little more complicated than just depositing into a bank account. So, we’re working through some of those operations that will position us to be able to build out the team that is going to be really focused on all of the planning aspects of the event.

The nature of the Kansas City metro area requires you to coordinate between two different states (Kansas City sits on the border of Kansas and Missouri). So, there are more governing issues and red tape to get through. How has that been going?

It’s definitely unique. I always laugh because obviously New York/New Jersey is branding as New York/New Jersey, whereas we are not. We’re Kansas City. But throughout the bid effort, you know, our mission was to unite a region, right? Unite the entire Midwest around this historic event, and, certainly, it required a ton of collaboration with key elected officials, but also business leaders and civic leaders on both sides of the state lines – both in Kansas and Missouri. I think we were really successful during the bid process at showing FIFA that we can collaborate in that way, in a way that makes us a really powerful host city, right, because we can tap into not only funding sources, but actual resources in the form of transportation resources, safety and security resources and things like that, again, in both Kansas and Missouri.

How do you envision Sporting KC and Kansas City Current’s stadiums and facilities being used?

At the time when we were bidding on the World Cup, they still hadn’t rebranded to the Kansas City Current, they were the KC NWSL, and we got to sort of give FIFA a sneak peek at the fact that they would be breaking ground on the first purpose-built training facility for a women’s professional sports team anywhere in the world. We strategically positioned Angie and Chris Long, the principal owners, with some key people on the FIFA side at lunch, and they sort of whispered and said, ‘Hey, we’re not going to stop there. We’re going to actually break ground on the first purpose-built competition venue for a women’s professional sports team in the world.’ So, I have to imagine that that helped our bid, just to be sort of making waves internationally in the world of soccer.

So, yes – our goal is to potentially utilize both their training facility and the competition venue. We are in a little bit of a holding pattern right now because we don’t know what the NWSL is going to do during the tournament. I think there’s obviously an assumption that MLS will pause and not play during that time. I don’t know what the NWSL is going to do.

I think that we’re hopeful that there’s something that can be done, whereby maybe the league doesn’t shut down, but that the host cities or the cities where there are training facilities – that the schedule can accommodate the needs of the FIFA World Cup during that time.

Have there been any conversations in Kansas City about being part of a U.S./Mexico bid for the Women’s World Cup in 2027?

I just had a conversation about this on my all-host city call this morning. I have not been intimately involved in dialogue around bidding for the Women’s World Cup. I do know, obviously, that the U.S. and Mexico will be submitting a joint bid. Those bids are due December 8.

We have heard that the host cities for the FIFA World Cup might be receiving letters, letters for signature that indicate an intent to participate in the bid. We have not received – I haven’t received – anything yet. U.S. Soccer is really leading that bid process.

I think Kansas City is a market (that) would be very interested in pursuing that opportunity. I say that, though, not being completely 100% up to speed on what the bid specs are, what the requirements are.

I did have a high-level conversation with FIFA when they were in town for a recent site visit and they said, ‘Oh, you’re gonna bid on the Women’s World Cup, correct?’ And, I said, ‘I actually don’t know, I don’t know if our market can support back-to-back World Cups.’ Additionally, the U.S. is hosting, obviously, the 2025 Club World Cup, and I think they’re working through what that kind of looks like from a match standpoint.

But I will tell you, FIFA sort of indicated to me that we should not be discouraged from bidding on the Women’s World Cup. We shouldn’t be concerned about the lifts. And that, you know, having come off of hosting the 2026 Men’s World Cup, that we would actually be really well positioned to host the Women’s World Cup.

Now that’s also FIFA – they don’t have to fundraise. We have some other things that we need to contemplate. But obviously that deadline is looming, and I am eagerly awaiting outreach from U.S. Soccer or (the) bid committee to better understand what that process is going to look like.

Have there been any conversations about when you expect a 2026 schedule?



End of year is what we’re still hearing. Some people have said that they’ve heard, you know, in January. As far as my conversations with FIFA, it still is end of year – whatever that means. Obviously, as a host city, it can’t come soon enough because it’s really critical from a planning and budgeting perspective.

What can you do now, without that guidance?

We can start modeling, for example, a transportation plan based on five to seven matches. So, certainly, there is some work that can be done that will then be refined once we have a match schedule. So, it’s not like we’re just waiting to hear back from them. But it would be nice, particularly from a budgeting perspective, as we’re going into core fundraising, to really have a better sense of what we’re looking at from a dollars and cents perspective. Five matches versus seven matches – there’s a big difference there.

How many games do you think Kansas City might get?

Optimistically, (we’re) hopeful that we could get it up through quarter final rounds. That would be absolutely incredible for this market. GEHA Field at Arrowhead, after modifications, is not big enough to host a semifinal or a final. Listen, any World Cup matches are incredible – but to get through quarterfinals would be just awesome.

Kansas City is the smallest host city. What does bringing the World Cup there mean for the area?

It’s a different proposition here in Kansas City than it is really, honestly, (in) any other host city. There’s so much enthusiasm around just the sport of soccer in our market, but also just the level of community engagement and interest in this event, in particular, is – I believe it to be very different than a lot of the other host cities.

You know, New York/New Jersey is my home away from home, but they have a lot going on, and have a lot of, you know, other events that might take attention somewhat away from the World Cup. I also think there’s some markets that you just assume they’re gonna’ host World Cup matches. We didn’t make any sort of assumption here in Kansas City.

But there’s a little bit of pressure to make sure that we’re conveying information out to our community in a frequent and robust manner that, I think, maybe, some of the other host cities don’t necessarily have. They don’t necessarily feel that obligation in the same way that we do.

And there is that branding of it being the soccer capital of America, right?

Yeah, we don’t want to just ‘talk the talk.’ We like to actually ‘walk that walk’ and really live into that idea that we are the soccer capital.

From your perspective, what would be a successful 2026 tournament in Kansas City?

We need to develop a really seamless transportation plan. I think we have a different lift than some of the other host cities when it comes to transportation, because we have less of a robust mass transit system here. We probably need to build a temporary system to service the event. And so, a successful World Cup for me is that, that transit system runs really smoothly and everybody who comes to Kansas City to experience this historic event is able to utilize it easily to navigate our region. Not just Kansas City, Missouri, but our entire region – and takes advantage of the opportunity to visit some of our incredible attractions that we have, outside of just attending matches and visiting Fan Fest.

So, we’ll see the long-term, positive impact from a tourism and business development perspective well after completion of the matches in 2026. But I just want people to come to Kansas City, and leave being like, ‘Wow, I had no idea that city was as cool as it is, or that those people were as nice as they are, that food was as delicious and amazing as it is.’ I want to leave them wanting more and wanting to come back and visit us again.
