                <textarea id="text" readonly> Jannik Sinner powers Italy fightback in Davis Cup thriller

Italy advanced to the Davis Cup semi-finals thanks to a 2-1 comeback victory over the Netherlands led by Jannik Sinner.

The Dutch team took an early lead after to Botic van de Zandschulp’s 6-7 (6-8) 6-3 7-6 (9-7) victory over Matteo Arnaldi.

Sinner, ranked fourth in the world, defeated Tallon Griekspoor 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 to equalise the score, he then teamed up with Lorenzo Sonego to win the decisive doubles match.

Sinner, who lost to Serbia’s Djokovic in Sunday’s ATP Finals championship match, prevailed in his singles rubber and took just 20 minutes to wrap up the second set.

For the decisive doubles match, Italy’s Filippo Volandri substituted Sinner in for Simone Bolelli, and the Netherlands’ captain Paul Haarhuis brought in Griekspoor for Jean-Julien Rojer to partner Wesley Koolhof.

With a 6-3 6-4 victory, Sinner and Sonego sent Italy—the 1976 champions—to their second consecutive Davis Cup semifinal.

“It means a lot to me,” Sinner said. “But more importantly we’re through to the semi-finals. It’s the first time I can experience this.

“We were under a lot of pressure. The decision to put us on the court for doubles, we have to give a lot of credit to the captain and the team… pushing us to the limit.”

Sinner had shrugged off any suggestion of fatigue ahead of the tie despite a busy season for the young Italian.

“I think every player in the end of the season is a little bit tired. Not only physically but also mentally. It has been a really long season for all of us.

“Obviously every week is different. I came here [Andalucia] not so long ago, but physically I feel ready to compete 100%.”

Sinner didn’t want to dwell on missing out on a massive title at the expense of is nation and is ready to give his all throughout the Finals sequence.

“I think it’s a really, really important week for all of us,” Sinner stressed the importance of Davis Cup tennis and added that he was delighted to get the opportunity to represent his country.

“Came here with obviously good feelings. It doesn’t really matter what happened last week. Here is completely new situation.

“It’s a team event, so happy to join the Italian team. Obviously happy that, you know, the captain took also me as a player. Then let’s see what’s coming for this week.”

Italy will face either Great Britain or Serbia in the semi-finals.
