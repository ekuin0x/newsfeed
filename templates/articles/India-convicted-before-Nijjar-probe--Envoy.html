"India was convicted even without..." Indian High Commissioner to Canada asks for Evidence on Nijjar Killing

NEW DELHI: The Indian government continues to seek “specific and relevant” evidence from Canada in the Hardeep Singh Nijjar murder case that it can look into, even as the Indian high commissioner in Ottawa, Sanjay Verma , said that India was “convicted” for the killing even before the probe could be completed.Despite the pressure from the US to join the Canadian probe into Nijjar’s killing, New Delhi has remained dismissive of Canada’s allegation about the possible involvement of Indian agents, maintaining that these were unsubstantiated and even absurd.Canada, however, believes its “credible allegations” against India received a boost earlier this week with the US endorsing reports it foiled an alleged plot involving Indian authorities to eliminate another Khalistan leader and US-Canadian citizen Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.“Even before the investigation was completed, India was convicted. Is that a rule of law?” asked Verma in an interview to a local news channel. After he was asked why he used the word convicted, Verma responded, “Because India was asked to cooperate”.“If you look at the typical terminology, when someone asks to cooperate, it means you are already convicted and you better cooperate,” said Verma in a rare TV interview. “We took it in a very different interpretation, but we always said that if there is anything specific and relevant and communicated to us, we will look into it.”India’s response to the US claims about the Pannun assassination plot was markedly different from its reaction to the Canadian allegations, with the government almost immediately admitting in the case that it received inputs from the US about a nexus between organised criminals and terrorists but stopping short of acknowledging the US seemed to link Indian agencies to the plot. According to the White House, after the issue was raised with India, the Indian government said activity of that nature was not its policy.Asked about the plot to eliminate Pannun, as alleged by the Americans, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau had said that his government had been working closely with allies, including the US, since the “middle of the summer.”“Obviously, we continue to engage with India in hopefully constructive ways, and we hope India will continue to take these real concerns seriously,” Trudeau had said.At the virtual G20 Summit on Wednesday, the Canadian PM spoke about the importance of upholding the rule of law and international law. </textarea>
