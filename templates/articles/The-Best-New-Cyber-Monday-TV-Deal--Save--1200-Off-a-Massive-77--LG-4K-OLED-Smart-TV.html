Cyber Monday Deal: 77" LG G2 Gallery Series 4K OLED TV for $2499.99

77" LG G2 Gallery Series 4K OLED Smart TV 31% off $3,599.99 1 $2,499.99 See on Amazon

The LG G2 was LG's highest end TV last year. This model sits above the C2 in the LG OLED hierarchy. The G2 is dubbed the "Gallery series" because of one important attribute: it's meant to be wall-mounted. Whereas the C2 and C3 include a stand, the G2 includes a wall mount (not a stand). The G2 is built from the ground up to be wall-mounted, and to that end, the svelte cabinet is uniformly flat. When mounted, it sits perfectly flush to the wall. The C2 has a big bulge at the bottom of its cabinet and so it cannot be flush mounted in the same way. So if you plan on getting your TV wall-mounted, the G2 is the better looking option.

The G2 also boasts a 20% brighter panel compared to the Evo C2. This year's C3 model has made improvements to the brightness, but the G2 is still brighter than even the C2 (you'd have to step up to the G3 to get anything better). OLEDs are perfect in almost every way except for the brightness; they are generally less bright than traditional LED LCD TVs. That's why every improvement matters a lot for an OLED TV. A brighter TV means better dynamic range for HDR, but it also means the picture is less likely to be washed out in brightly lit or sun-filled rooms with poor light control.

Aside from that, the G2 is similar to most other true OLED TVs. Compared to traditional LED LCD TVs, OLED TVs offer better image quality, deeper blacks, better contrast ratio, wider color gamut, and super fast response times. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV are easily the best type of TV for viewing 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. LG OLED TVs particular have been out for years and benefit from several generations of optimizations. The first LG OLED TV (a 55" model) was released back in 2010, well before other manufacturers introduced their own consumer-ready TVs to the market.

In addition to the OLED technology, the LG G2 has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV as well. It has a native 120Hz panel and all four HDMI 2.1 ports for running 4K at 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. It also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM).
