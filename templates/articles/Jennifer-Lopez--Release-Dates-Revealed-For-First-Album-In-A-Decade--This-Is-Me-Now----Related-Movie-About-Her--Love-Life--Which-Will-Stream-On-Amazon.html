                <textarea id="text" readonly> Jennifer Lopez’s first studio album in a decade, This Is Me…Now, has been set for release on February 16, 2024.

News comes down today that there will also be a movie “inspired by the music” releasing on the same date. Amazon MGM Studios has acquired and will release Nuyorican Productions’ This Is Me…Now: The Film on Prime Video worldwide.

The release of This Is Me…Now celebrates the anniversary of its sister album, This is Me…Then, which was released 20 years ago. The new album, written and executive-produced by Lopez and Rogét Chayed, along with Angel Lopez, Jeff “Gitty” Gitelman, HitBoy, Tay Keith and INK among others, will combine R&B, pop, hip-hop and Lopez’s vocals.

This is Me…Now: The Film is described as “a narrative driven, intimate, reflective, sexy, funny, fantastical musical and visual reimagining of [Lopez’s] publicly scrutinized love life”.

The official press release for the launch describes the project as follows: “Along with Director Dave Meyers, Lopez creates a genre-redefining immersive cinematic experience: an extravagant visual and sonic feast with impressive choreography, star studded cameos, costumes, sets and blockbuster-worthy visuals. Although an astonishing vivid spectacle, the film is ultimately a heartfelt ode to JL’s journey of self-healing and everlasting belief in fairytale endings. Audiences will be captivated and leave hopeful that true love can be more than a dream.”

Can’t Get Enough, the first single from This Is Me…Now: The Album, will be released on Wednesday, January 10, 2024. </textarea>
