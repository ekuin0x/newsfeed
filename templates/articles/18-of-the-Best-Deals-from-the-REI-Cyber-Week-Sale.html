25% Off La Sportiva Mutant Trail Runners (Women’s | Men’s)

Sale $124 (Reg. $165)

Stack height: 26/16mm

26/16mm Drop: 10mm

Often cited as having some of the stickiest rubber of any trail running shoes, La Sportiva is known for making kicks that can handle rugged terrain. The deep lugs on the Mutant’s outsole will help you maintain traction even when the ground gets sloppy, and the precise fit makes these great for scrambly adventures. Soft shoes with wide footboxes might work great on smooth trail, but if your ambitions include a high route or lots of bare rock, then you’ll do better with a shoe designed for the task.

Other popular La Sportiva trail runners are also on sale during Cyber Week, including the Jackal II (Women’s | Men’s).

30% Off REI Hyperaxis Fleece Jacket 2.0 (Women’s | Men’s)

Sale $104 (Reg. $149)

Weight: 14.2 oz women’s | 15.8 oz men’s

The Hyperaxis features four-way stretch Polartec Power Stretch fabric, making it perfect for active layering on cold hikes. It also looks better than a lot of fleeces, so it’s a good stand-alone garment for warm trail nights or cool evenings in town.

25% Off Icebreaker 200 Oasis Crew Top Base Layer (Women’s | Men’s)

Sale $79 (Reg. $105)

Material: 100% merino wool



Icebreaker has been a giant in the merino wool clothing world for years, and with good reason. These base layers are ultralight and perfect for backpacking. Other Icebreaker layers that are 25% off during the Cyber Week Sale include:

Oasis 200 Leggings Women’s | Men’s

Oasis 200 LS Half-Zip Women’s | Men’s

Sphere II T-shirt Women’s | Men’s

30% Off Big Agnes Sidewinder SL 20 Sleeping Bag (Women’s | Men’s)

Sale $210 (Reg. $300)

Weight: 42 oz women’s | 36 oz men’s

42 oz women’s | 36 oz men’s Insulation: 650 fill-power down

The Sidewinder ain’t your typical sleeping bag. Nope, it was designed with side-sleepers in mind, who often wake up suffocated by a hood designed for back-sleepers. This hood fits more like a jacket, meaning that it will flip and roll with you, and the footbox is shaped to mimic side-facing feet. Big Agnes also added some extra padding to soften the pressure on your hips.

30% Off Marmot Trestles Elite Eco 20 Sleeping Bag (Women’s | Men’s)

Sale $118 (Reg. $169)

Weight: 43 oz women’s | 38 oz men’s



43 oz women’s | 38 oz men’s Insulation: recycled synthetic

Who says sleeping bags have to be expensive? This synthetic classic is ideal for wet conditions, and it just got even more affordable this week thanks to the REI Cyber Week Sale. Inventory is limited on this item, so grab one while you still can.

Also check out the 650-fill-down Marmot Sawtooth 15 (men’s) and Teton 15 (women’s) during the sale.

40% Off Sea to Summit Thermolite Reactor Extreme Sleeping Bag Liner

Sale $45 (Reg. $75)

MSRP: $75

$75 Weight: 14 oz.

14 oz. Added Warmth: Up to 25 degrees F

A sleeping bag liner is a great way to add warmth to your sleep system without having to shell out for a brand-new bag. We’re not sure we quite believe the claimed warmth bonus of up to 25˚F, but the difference is noticeable. As a bonus, the liner will protect your sleeping bag from body oils and thru-hiker odors so that it stays cleaner longer.

30% Off Arc’teryx Kadin Hoodie (Women’s | Men’s)

Sale $280 (Reg. $400)

Weight: 9.9 oz women’s | 11.1 oz men’s

While the Kadin doesn’t have an obvious place on a traditional lightweight backpacking gear list, good gear always makes itself useful, and this is one of those jackets. Not a rain shell and not an insulated puffy, this weather-resistant layer combines non-waterproof protection with comfort and style, and will quickly become the jacket that you bring with you everywhere.

25% Off Gerber Mini Paraframe Serrated Knife

Sale $11.20 (Reg. $15)

Weight: 1.4 oz

Alright, Rambo, you can leave your Bowie knife at home during your next thru-hike. Bring this little folding knife instead. Large enough to slice a hiker-hunger’s worth of hard cheese and dry salami, yet light enough to forget about, the Gerber Mini Paraframe might even be more knife than you need.

25% off Salomon Speedcross 6 Trail Runners (Women’s | Men’s )

Sale $105 (Reg. $140)

Heel-toe drop: 10mm

If you’re looking for a pair of trail runners that can handle rugged trail, then the Salomon Speedcross might just be exactly what you’re looking for. A precise fit and deep lugs make these shoes a champion of technical and messy terrain. However, as with all footwear, personal fit is important and Salomon’s tend to fit narrow feet best.

Other popular Salomon shoes are also 25% off, including:

Salomon X Ultra 4 Low women’s | men’s

Salomon XA Pro 3D V9 women’s | men’s

25% Off BioLite HeadLamp 425

Sale $45 (Reg. $60)

Weight: 2.8 oz

This headlamp has a comfortably wide strap and balanced construction with the battery/rear light hanging out separately from the front light. Yet even with this odd design, it is remarkably lightweight.

“The 425 is especially attractive if you’re a multi-sport person. It’s also great if you’re someone who’s just starting to get into camping/backpacking and trying to justify the cost of all the gear you’re buying: if you have a dog to walk, a bike to ride, or frequently find yourself on pre-dawn runs around town, this headlamp would be useful in your daily life as well as the backcountry.” — Anne K. Baker

25% Off Helinox Chair Zero

Sale $112 (Reg. $150)

Packed Weight: 17 oz (1 lb 2 oz)

17 oz (1 lb 2 oz) Capacity: 265 lb

“While I necessarily wouldn’t take it on a long hike I love bringing my Helinox on shorter sections. It’s lightweight and shockingly comfortable. It’s even my go-to chair for hanging around the fire with my friends and roommates when we’re all just hanging out, and I like to keep it in my car just in case.” — Moose Juice

25% Off GSI Outdoors Essential Long Spoon

Sale $4.10 (Reg. $5.50)

Weight: 1 oz

They say you gotta spend money to save money, and sure, this isn’t a bank-busting deal, but this is still the best camp utensil in the world. Saving a buck just sweetens the deal a little bit more.

“For some reason, sporks and titanium cutlery have taken over the backpacker’s kitchen kit. The truth is, sporks are garbage at everything and are way too short to be practical. Titanium is pretty cool and lightweight, but the silicone edge on this spoon is the ultimate food bowl/container squeegee. The long handle also keeps those nasty hiker hands out of even the deepest food vessels, which helps prevent sickness.” — Owen Eigenbrot

If you need more kitchen stuff, then take advantage of 25% off all GSI Outdoors cook gear.

25% Off Exped Ultra 3R Mummy Sleeping Pad

Sale $120 (Reg. $160)

Weight: 13 oz

13 oz R-value: 2.9

Even if you love hiking all day, you’ll need a good night’s sleep to recharge those batteries. A comfy inflatable pad not only smooths out rocks and roots, but also keeps you insulated from the ground’s chill. The Ultra 3R Mummy boasts 3 inches of cushion and an R-value of 2.9, which should be good for most three-season excursions. The tapered mummy shape also keeps this pad remarkably lightweight, though rectangular versions exist for hikers who prefer a little more room to wiggle.

And if you want a warmer/smaller, or lighter/warmer sleeping pad, then check out Exped’s other offerings. They’re all 25% off, including the warmer Ultra 7R Mummy.

40% Off Mountain Hardwear Bishop Pass 15 Sleeping Bag (Women’s | Men’s)

Sale $171 ($285)

Weight: 40 oz women’s | 37 oz men’s

40 oz women’s | 37 oz men’s Insulation: 650 fill-power down

The Bishop Pass isn’t just an iconic spot near the JMT in the High Sierra, but it is also a classic sleeping bag. While it’s not the lightest bag available, it is a reliable option if you want to avoid a cold night without thinking too hard about the expected conditions. Zip in and snuggle under the hood — you’ll probably be toasty even during that unexpected summer cold-snap.

20% Off Grayl GeoPress Water Filter and Purifier Bottle

Sale $80 (Reg. $100)

Weight: 16 oz

16 oz Capacity: 24 oz

24 oz Filters: protozoa, bacteria, and viruses

Even though it is heavy for a water filter, the Grayl will remove more nasty stuff from your water than the lightweight options that are popular with thru-hikers. If you’ll be hiking internationally or in areas with badly contaminated water, you’ll want a filter that can keep you safe from viruses, chemicals, and heavy metals — harmful stuff not removed by squeeze-style filters. Grab a Grayl to eliminate the need for bottled water during your trek in Nepal or for the southern portion of the Florida Trail to save you from some major hauls between safe drinking water sources.

40% off REI Co-op XeroDry GTX Jacket (Women’s | Men’s)

Sale $107 (Reg. $180)

Weight: 10.9 oz women’s | 12.7 oz men’s

The Xerodry is the top high-performance REI rain jacket. It’s eminently functional with sleek waterproof zippers and breathable Gore-Tex without blowing up the scale.

Read our review of the REI XeroDry GTX Jacket here.

50% off REI Co-op Magma 850 Down Hoodie (Women’s | Men’s)

Sale $124 (Reg. $249)

Weight: 10.6 oz women’s | 12.3 oz men’s

It’s always nice to snag a top-notch puffy on sale, and this is one of the best. 850-fill premium goose down has a phenomenal warmth-to-weight ratio, and there’s plenty of it in the Magma Hoodie, making this insulated jacket a perfect choice for most trips to the backcountry.

40% Off Saucony Peregrine 13 Trail Runners (Women’s | Men’s)

Sale $84 (Reg. $140)

Stack height: 28/24mm

28/24mm Drop: 4mm

In a world dominated by wide-toebox, max cushion trail running marshmallows, the Saucony Peregrine often gets overlooked as a capable thru-hiking shoe. If the looser-fitting Altra or Topo options don’t do it for you, or if Hoka’s just look too… Hoka, then give the Peregrine a whirl. The fit has a lot in common with the ever-popular Brooks Cascadia, and the outsole has the chops to handle the daily dust and muck of long-trail life.
