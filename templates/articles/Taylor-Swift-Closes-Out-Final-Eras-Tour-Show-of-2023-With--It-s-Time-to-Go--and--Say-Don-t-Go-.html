                <textarea id="text" readonly> For her final concert of 2023, Taylor Swift gave the crowd a proper farewell. As part of her “Surprise Songs” segment, where the singer plays two songs not heard before on the Eras Tour, Swift debuted “Say Don’t Go,” the vault song from her recently released 1989 (Taylor’s Version), and the Evermore deluxe version track, “It’s Time to Go.”

Her song choices, though on point for the occasion, came as a surprise to the crowd that had instead expected an announcement for the release of Reputation (Taylor’s Version). Throughout Sunday night — Swift’s third concert in São Paulo — “Rep TV” trended on X, the social platform previously known as Twitter, and even seemed to trip up Swift herself, who said “Rep” instead of “Eras” tour, while introducing the acoustic portion of the evening.

“Now you’ve gotten in my head,” Swift conceded as the crowd cheered over her mistake.

Before the acoustic performance of “Say Don’t Go,” her collaboration with Diane Warren, Swift went on to say that when The Eras Tour returns in 2024, she is going to open it back to all her songs. “I feel like, for one year, we’ve really gotten through a lot of songs. I’m going to make all the songs fair game.”

Swift closed out 2023 with “It’s Time to Go,” a song she co-wrote with Aaron Dessner, from the 2020 Evermore deluxe version.

“This has been the most magical adventure of my life,” Swift said earlier in the evening during the Evermore portion of the concert. “We find ourselves on the last night of The Eras Tour 2023. This tour is something that I thought of because I really wanted to celebrate all the times you guys have been there for me, and put together a show that incorporated all my favorite memories of touring — and I’ve been touring most of my life. I love traveling through these memories with you.” Editor’s picks

At Swift’s Saturday night concert in São Paulo, the singer opened up about her new tradition of playing two surprise songs a night. “I really wanted to try to challenge myself to play as many songs that I haven’t played live, ever or in a very long time, on this tour. So, I try to do a different one on guitar, a different one on piano, and I really, really try to make sure it’s one that I haven’t played on this tour,” she said, before performing “Safe & Sound” from the Hunger Games soundtrack and the ballad “Untouchable” from Fearless.

Previously in São Paulo, on her first night out of three, Swift dusted off Speak Now’s “Innocent” for the first time since the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards. She also live debuted “Bigger Than the Whole Sky” in Rio de Janeiro, seen as an emotional tribute to the death of a fan at one of her Brazil concerts.

After closing out the The Eras Tour this weekend in South America, Swift will pick back up again in February 2024 with four nights in Tokyo. Those dates notably conclude February 10, or a night before the Super Bowl, in case someone in particular is playing in the Big Game. </textarea>
