                <textarea id="text" readonly> There are already plenty of excellent board game deals to check out during Cyber Monday, but you won’t want to miss this spectacular deal at Target. For the remainder of Cyber Monday, you can get a third board game for free when you purchase a pair of other titles of equal or greater value. While this sale includes plenty of epic tabletop games like Twilight Imperium Fourth Edition and Mice & Mystics, it also features more casual titles like Ticket to Ride and Wingspan.

You don’t need a promo code or to be a Target Circle Club member to take advantage of this offer. Just add three games to your cart, and the least expensive title will be deducted from your total. Target has included dozens of titles in this promotion, and while we’ve collected a handful of our favorites below, you can head over to the retailer’s landing page to peruse the whole collection.
