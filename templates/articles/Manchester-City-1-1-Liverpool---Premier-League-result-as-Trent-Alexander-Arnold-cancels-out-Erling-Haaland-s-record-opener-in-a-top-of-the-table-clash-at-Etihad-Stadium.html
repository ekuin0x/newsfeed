                <textarea id="text" readonly> MAN CITY'S PERFECT HOME RUN ENDS AS SPOILS SHARED IN CLASH OF TITLE RIVALS

Erling Haaland became the fastest player in history to plunder 50 Premier League goals but Trent Alexander-Arnold’s stunning late strike earned Liverpool a 1-1 draw in an entertaining top-of-the-table clash at Etihad Stadium.

Haaland opened the scoring on 27 minutes when he collected Nathan Ake’s pass and drilled a low strike into the bottom corner following a miscued kick from visiting goalkeeper, Alisson.

It saw the Norwegian forward obliterate Andrew Cole’s previous record of 50 top-flight goals in 65 outings, with the 23-year-old achieving the feat in just 48 matches.

Liverpool had contributed to a lively and even first half with Darwin Nunez failing to make the most of a series of good openings, including one header that was well saved by a full-stretch Ederson.

City created the better chances in the second half but the visitors silenced the home crowd 10 minutes from time when Alexander-Arnold rifled a sublime low shot into the far corner to earn a share of the spoils.

The result means City fail to equal the English top-flight record of 24 straight home wins in all competitions, set by Sunderland in the 1890s, and they remain just the one point ahead of the second-placed Merseysiders with the rest of the weekend’s top-flight fixtures to come.

Next up, Man City host RB Leipzig in the UEFA Champions League before entertaining Tottenham on Sunday. Liverpool are at home to LASK in the UEFA Europa League and then welcome Fulham to Anfield on Sunday. </textarea>
