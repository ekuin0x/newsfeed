                <textarea id="text" readonly> President Biden says he hopes that Israel and Hamas will hold to the current ceasefire so long as Hamas continues to release hostages.

Biden made the remarks on Sunday following the release of 4-year-old Avigail Idan. Israel and Hamas had agreed to a four-day cease-fire and the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian criminals held in Israeli prisons.

Biden said the deal allowed for a cease-fire extension of one day for every 10 hostages released by Hamas.

"I would like to see the pause go on as long as prisoners keep coming out," Biden told reporters after his remarks.

Israel believes there were nearly 240 hostages in Gaza prior to the exchange deal, which is expected to result in the release of 50 women and children. The U.S. believes 10 of its citizens were in Hamas custody, though one was confirmed to be released on Sunday. </textarea>
