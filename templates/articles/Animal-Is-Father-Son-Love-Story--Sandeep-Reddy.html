                <textarea id="text" readonly> The theatrical trailer of Ranbir Kapoor and Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s emotional action-drama Animal was released a couple of days ago to superb response.

About the theme of the movie, the director informs, “Animal can be seen as a father-son love story. The essence of the story is how far a man will go for his family.”

Like Vijay Deverakonda in Arjun Reddy, Ranbir’s character also looked arrogant in Animal. However, Sandeep says there’s no other similarity other than that between these two movies.

“The character of Arjun Reddy cannot control his anger. However, the character in Animal usually has the same anger that all people have. Both are character-based movies. Apart from that, the story and character are completely different.”

Sandeep Reddy, however, makes it clear that both the emotion and violence are rightly balanced in both these movies.

The director says Rashmika’s character is also very crucial. “Rashmika’s character will be there throughout the movie. This character understands the hero more than his parents. After the hero, Rashmika and Anil Kapoor's roles are equally important. The movie also has a good love story.”

The movie has a lengthy runtime of 3 hours and 21 mins. Nonetheless, the director clarifies saying runtime is not a big deal, and the audience will enjoy the movie all through.

The excitement around Animal reached the next level, after the release of the trailer and it was witnessed in the advance bookings. The advance bookings opened a few hours back and nearly 10K tickets are sold for every hour. </textarea>
