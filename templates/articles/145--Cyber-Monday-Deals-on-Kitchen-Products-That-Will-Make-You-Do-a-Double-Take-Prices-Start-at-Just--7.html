Best Cyber Monday Cookware Deals

There’s no denying that heritage cookware from the coveted brands like All-Clad, Le Creuset, and Lodge can be expensive, which is why it's always a good idea to grab the pieces you’ve had your eye on, like this set of All-Clad frying pans, this Lodge Dutch oven that is 49% off, or this Staub braiser.

All-Clad Nonstick Pans, Set of 2

Williams Sonoma

If there is one piece of cookware you should treat yourself to this Cyber Monday, it’s the iconic Le Creuset Dutch oven. Out of the many Dutch ovens out there, we named this one our tested pick for the best Dutch oven splurge, praising both its versatility and durability. Although it rarely goes on sale, right now you can score the 3.5-quart version for 31% off. Enameled cast iron has a number of benefits, including the fact that it both heats evenly and maintains its temperature, which is what makes it particularly adept at braising meat and summering slow-cooked sauces. You’ll also appreciate that the nonstick coating on the interior releases your food without a fuss.

Le Creuset 3.5-Quart Cast Iron Dutch Oven

Williams Sonoma

At just $25 right now, this impressively versatile Lodge 12-inch cast iron pan is a cookware essential. With its high sides and wide base, it has a variety of applications, from searing pork chops to baking pizza. And thanks to two handles on either side, it’s especially easy to maneuver from the stove into the oven. You already know that Lodge cast iron cookware retains heat exceptionally well, and that the more often you use it and maintain its seasoning, the more durable and effective it will become, so you can also rest assured you’ll still be cooking with it decades from now. With more than 9,400 five-star ratings on Amazon, shoppers agree that it's a keeper — in fact, one shopper even wrote “I can’t recommend this pan highly enough. The 12-inch size is so versatile, I can cook almost anything in it. It distributes heat well, and gets hot enough to sear well.”

Best Cyber Monday Knife Deals

Those dull knives in your drawer will never get through holiday cooking, on top of preparing three meals a day for your hungry family, so now is the time to replace them. And thankfully, Williams-Sonoma, Amazon, and more are filled with deals on great knives for Cyber Monday, all from top brands like Henckels, Wüsthof, Shun, Zwilling, and more. In fact, a Henckels set is currently over $200 off.

Henckels 15-Piece Knife Set

Amazon

But let’s start with this Calphalon 12-piece knife set — it comes with all the essentials and right now it’s 65% off. Inside the wooden knife block, you’ll find a 8-inch Chef's Knife, a 6-inch utility knife, a 5-inch Santoku, 4.5-inch paring knife, and six steak knives, plus a pair of kitchen shears. The built-in ceramic sharpeners automatically sharpen the knives each time you remove and replace them in the block, for extra easy maintenance.

Calphalon Classic 12-Piece Kitchen Knife Set

Amazon

Wusthof knives are well-known for extra hearty designs — the high carbon stainless steel blades are corrosion-resistant and sharpened with a laser, according to the brand, to ensure each cut is precise. And right now you can grab a set of two for 43% off. The 6-inch chef’s knife is durable enough to use for meal prep every night, while the paring knife will come in handy for more precise tasks like peeling fruit, mincing herbs or garlic, or thinly slicing fruit. Together, these two razor sharps knives will become your trusted kitchen companions.

Best Cyber Monday Kitchen Appliance Deals

Discounts like these on big ticket appliances don’t come along often — these Cyber Monday deals include a now-40% off Keurig coffee maker, and a rice cooker for just $15. But there’s also air fryers, food processors, and toasters from top-brands on sale.

Cuisinart 12-Cup Food Processor

Amazon

A Vitamix blender is another appliance investment you won’t regret, and right now the 64-ounce 5200 model is on sale. Thanks to its powerful motor and tough stainless steel blades, it can puree nuts, frozen fruit, whole leaves of kale, and more without burning out, which is why it's one of our favorites. There are 10 speed settings, plus a pulse function (which is also handy for finely chopping tomatoes, herbs, and beans), so you can customize the texture to your liking, but no matter what it will produce creamy smoothies, sauces, nut butters, and more. And did I mention that it can actually whip up a simple soup, too? According to the brand, the blades move fast enough at the highest speed setting to heat up cold mixtures.

Like anyone who is serious about baking, I bought a KitchenAid stand mixer when I decided to upgrade all my baking tools, and now is the time to grab one for yourself, too. Right now, our favorite, the 4.5-quart KitchenAid stand mixer is 27% off. The bowl has a large enough capacity for eight dozen cookies, according to the brand, and it comes with a wire whisk, a dough hook, and a flat beater. With ten speed settings and a powerful motor to back it up, this stand mixer can handle thick cake batter, mashed potatoes — even pasta dough.

Best Cyber Monday Bakeware Deals

Now that the holiday season is upon us, you’re sure to start baking frequently, but to do that you’re going to need reliable bakeware that is durable enough to endure the oven’s high temperatures. Thankfully, Cyber Monday is full of bakeware sales from top brands like Nordic Ware, Le Creuset and Pyrex.

Le Creuset Stoneware Rectangular Dish with Platter Lid

Williams Sonoma

This set of three Nordic Ware baking sheets is a must-have, thanks to the fact that they come in handy for all kinds of tasks — from baking cookies to preparing sheet pan meals. Our expert testers love Nordic Ware baking sheets, thanks to the fact that releasing food from the surface is “extremely easy.” They also achieve “even browning” and require “minimal scrubbing” to clean. And right now the set is 48% off.

Nordic Ware Bakers Delight Set of 3 Baking Sheets

Amazon

Another deal worth grabbing is on these no-frills Pyrex baking dishes, perfect for weeknight dinners. The rectangular shape and depth can accommodate baked pasta dishes and casseroles, and these will never crack or lose their shape in the oven, making some of the most durable baking dishes out there. Pyrex glassware is beloved for the fact that it picks up stains or odors from food, so you can use them again and again. And when dinner is over don’t worry about soaking and scrubbing until you’re red in the face — these glass dishes can easily be wiped clean with soap and warm water.

Best Cyber Monday Steam Mop and Vacuum Deals

Cleaning your kitchen and the rest of your home doesn’t have to be a hassle — all you need is a powerful and efficient steam mop or vacuum. And thankfully, cleaning supplies from top brands like Shark, Bissell, O-Cedar, and plenty more are being discounted heavily during Cyber Monday.

O-Cedar Spray Mop

Amazon

Take the Shark Steam Pocket Mop. The mop doesn’t use chemicals, but rather a reservoir of water, which it heats up and turns to steam, to lift dirt, stains, and crusted-on food debris from your kitchen floors. The cleaning pad is reusable and washable, so it saves you money on disposable cleaning products in the long run, too. For $60 right now, it’s a total steal.

Shark Steam Pocket Mop

Target

And if you’re looking for a vacuum, you should check out this Dirt Devil stick vacuum, which is just $37. It works on hardwood floors and carpeting and easily transforms into a hand-held vacuum to grab pet hair, crumbs, and other small messes. At just over three pounds, it’s light enough to carry about the house without much strain. Plus, the clear canister releases from the body of the vacuum with the press of a button, and can be emptied straight into the garbage.

Best Cyber Monday Kitchen Tool and Gadget Deals

Even what looks like the smallest kitchen tool can solve frustrating kitchen problems, so be sure to add these to your cart while they’re still on sale. Find savings on milk frothers, cutting boards, meat thermometers, pasta bowls, and so much more at retailers like Amazon, Yeti, and Target.

Y Yhy 9.75-Inch Pasta Bowls

Amazon

Consider this Yeti 26-ounce straw cup, for instance. Yeti products aren't often on sale, so you need to grab it while it’s just $26. With its generous 26-ounce capacity it is convenient for all day use because it doesn’t need to be refilled often. Yeti’s signature double-walled vacuum insulation is the key to its popularity — drinks stay cold for as many as 18 hours, according to the brand. And you can feel comfortable taking it on everyday errands or outdoor adventures, because the stainless steel exterior is tough to handle hiking, boating, and camping without it denting or chipping.

The Meater meat thermometer is the height of grilling tools — it’s a must for any grilling enthusiast, which makes it a great gift, although we wouldn’t blame you if you grabbed it for yourself. In a test of 42 meat thermometers, our testers the Meater one of our favorites. There’s no guesswork involved in using it. It features two probes, one for measuring the temperature of the meat you’re cooking, and another to measure ambient temperature. One of the most appealing features is that it's completely wireless — through Bluetooth the thermometer connects to your phone through an app, where you can control over your target temperature, and even shows the estimated cook time remaining so there’s no risk of over or under cooking your dinner.
