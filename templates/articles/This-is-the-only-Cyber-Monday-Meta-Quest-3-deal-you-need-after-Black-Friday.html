                <textarea id="text" readonly> As the Black Friday weekend moves into Cyber Monday we're spotting a great Meta Quest 3 deal at Newegg.

The Meta Quest 2 (formerly the Oculus Quest 2) was a great showcase for consumer-level VR, packing everything neatly into a headset at a competitive price point and putting the brand, formerly known as Facebook, in plenty of living rooms around the world.



As part of the Cyber Monday deals, you can get a free $15 gift card at Newegg with a Meta Quest 3 (128GB), and a $25 gift card with the Meta Quest 3 (512GB), and get a copy of upcoming game Asgard's Wrath 2 free when it launches.

How do you follow up on such a formative device for a nascent medium? As it happens, the answer is to do it again but do it better. The Meta Quest 3 is leaps and bounds beyond its predecessor in very real, tangible ways; the resolution is dramatically sharper, there's more storage at launch than the Quest 2 had when it arrived, and the internal Snapdragon processor is faster.

This all coalesces into a comfortable headset that helps mitigate the "screen door" effect of other headsets.

We only recently reviewed the Meta Quest 3, so we're surprised to see it already getting a Cyber Monday deal just weeks after launch.

Newegg is offering the Meta Quest 3 (128GB) at its $499.99 MSRP, but it's also got a couple of free gifts available for those ready to take the plunge.

Aside from a free copy of Asgard's Wrath 2, a game expected to be Quest 3's "killer app" when it launches next month, you'll also get a $15 Meta Quest gift card sent via email, too, which you can use in the on-device store to pick up additional games and apps.

Better yet, that voucher jumps to $25 if you pick up the $649.99 512GB version, and you'll also get 2 free games a month through a free six-month subscription to Meta Quest+.

Meta Quest 3 128GB Asgard's Wrath 2 Bundle now $499.99 at Newegg. Get a free game and a $15 gift voucher for Cyber Monday when you buy the excellent Meta Quest 3 headset which only launched a few short weeks ago.

Meta Quest 3 512GB Asgard's Wrath 2 Bundle now $649.99 at Newegg. Get a free game,$25 gift voucher, and 6-month Meta+ subscription for absolutely nothing when you buy the larger version of the Meta Quest 3.

The Meta Quest 3 comes with everything you need to get going out of the box, including the headset itself and a pair of Meta's latest controllers.

Its secret superpower, however, is that you can plug it into a powerful PC and turn it into a PCVR headset, opening up the likes of critically acclaimed Half-Life: Alyx to play.

It's also backward compatible, so your existing Meta Quest 2 games can all be found ready to go on the new headset, too.

For more on the Meta Quest 3, be sure to check out our full Meta Quest 3 review which we published last week. We've got a full rundown of the best VR headsets, too.

Key Specs: Works standalone, but can be used with a PC via USB-C or wirelessly using Air Link. Resolution of 2064x2208 pixels per eye with 110 degrees field of view and up to 120Hz refresh rate (experimental). Includes two controllers.

Consensus: The Meta Quest 3 is a fantastic headset with a growing number of experiences for users of all experience levels in VR. From walking alongside dinosaurs to skulking in the shadows of Renaissance-era Venice, there's a Meta Quest 3 experience for just about anyone.

Buy if: You want to experience VR without a console or PC, or you're looking for the best way to play Beat Saber.

Don't buy if: You want the most impressive VR headset - the Valve Index and HTC Vive Pro remain some of the best in their field, albeit at a much higher price point.

Alternative models: If you already own a PlayStation 5, PlayStation VR 2 is worth a look, offering impressive exclusives like Horizon: Call of the Mountain. The Meta Quest Pro is also an option, but it's significantly pricier and aimed at VR professionals.
