                <textarea id="text" readonly> Sean Dyche slammed Everton's 10-point deduction for breaching financial rules as unjust and disproportionate.

But the Toffees manager insisted last week's punishment from the Premier League would strengthen his team's siege mentality as they aim to beat relegation.

Dyche's men are 19th in the table as they prepare to host Manchester United on Sunday, with only goal difference keeping them ahead of Burnley, after Everton were sanctioned for overspending by Â£19.5million over a four-year period ending in the 2021-22 season - a decision against which they will appeal.

The punishment sparked protests from fans, pundits and local politicians, and Dyche admitted he was amazed at the decision.

He said: 'Like everyone, I was shocked. The enormity of it. Disproportionate is a word that has been used by the club.'

Sean Dyche has been left aghast at the league's decision to deduct 10 points from Everton

The Premier League's decision has plunged Everton to 19th in the table and battling relegation

Club captain Seamus Coleman and other senior players such as James Tarkowski and Ashley Young were vocal in a team meeting yesterday morning, in which they told the squad that their mentality - which has seen Everton win six of their last nine games - must remain the same.

'It doesn't change the focus of sorting things out on the pitch,' added Dyche.

'We were on the right lines for that and this has just given us a push backwards to go forward again. The final league table is the truth of a season.

'I told the lads that, for sure, it changes the viewpoint but it doesn't change what we are doing.

'We have to go harder for longer and stronger. It's been more about refocus than anything. All the senior boys have rallied and said, "Let's take on the next challenge".

'There have been plenty of challenges since I've been here so let's take it on. I don't know every inch of what went on but I certainly believe in what the club has put forward.

'The fact is it is disproportionate. It is unjust. What is done is done, appeal pending. We have to get on with it.'

Everton's punishment has brought the 115 financial charges facing Manchester City back under the microscope, with Pep Guardiola saying on Friday he is even more likely to remain as boss if his Treble winners are relegated to League One.

The Catalan said the two cases are 'completely different' and added: 'You've questioned me like we have been punished.

'At the moment we're innocent. Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it. But absolutely I will not consider my future depending on being here or being in League One. There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we were in the Champions League.

'People think, "City, why don't they go to the Conference?" Wait. Wait. When you read that we should be relegated, of course I'm frustrated because nobody knows exactly.'

Everton fans will protest against their points deduction at Sunday's game against United with 'Premier League corrupt' placards, banners and flags at Goodison Park.

Everton's senior players spoke up in a team meeting and a siege mentality has been created

United boss Erik ten Hag warned: 'I can see they are mad. If they are mad, that's their fuel.

'We have to match those standards. If we match the standards we have a very good chance to win.'

Meanwhile, Manchester United have been dealt another injury setback after Mason Mount suffered a calf strain in training that could keep him out for up to a month.

The club's medical staff are still assessing the problem, but early indications are that the midfielder could be out for up to four weeks.
