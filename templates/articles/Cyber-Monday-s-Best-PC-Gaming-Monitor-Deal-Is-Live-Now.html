                <textarea id="text" readonly> The best Cyber Monday deals at Walmart are underway now, and some of its greatest Black Friday tech and PC gaming deals are still alive. Among Walmart's deals right now is what's easily the best Cyber Monday deal in PC gaming, the 32" LG Ultragear monitor for $169.99.

Best Cyber Monday Gaming Monitor Deal

LG Ultragear 32" Gaming Monitor for 52% Off at Walmart

LG Ultragear 32" Gaming Monitor 1440p resolution with 165Hz refresh and 1ms response time. 52% off $349.99 2 $169.00 See on Walmart

I have the LG Ultragear 27" 1440p 144Hz monitor and it rules. This 32" gaming monitor deal at Walmart is bigger and better than the one I have, and at $169, the 32" Ultragear is actually cheaper than my 27". I would feel bummed out, but I'm not. In fact, I'm happy for you, someone who gets to buy and enjoy this monitor for such a crazy low price.

Normally this monitor is $349, which is what I would expect to pay for a monitor with a 165Hz refresh and 1ms response. The fact it's on sale for $180 less than that is kind of crazy.

The LG Ultragear 32" monitor deal was previously at Walmart for Black Friday but was sold out before the end of Thanksgiving Day. With Cyber Monday deals kicking off everywhere, this is one of those great PC gaming deals you should absolutely move on sooner rather than later.

Walmart has done a pretty excellent job with the deals this Black Friday and Cyber Monday season. We saw the return of Walmart's TCL 4-series Black Friday deal, with the 65" version priced at $288 and the 55" priced at $188. On top of that, Walmart has some of the best video game Cyber Monday deals happening, with huge discounts on digital and physical games right now.

Walmart also has the Nintendo Switch Super Smash Bros. Black Friday bundle, and of course, the most popular Cyber Monday video game deal of all, the PS5 Slim Spider-Man bundle.
