                <textarea id="text" readonly> Gee, a lot happened at Survivor Series in Chicago last night (Nov. 25, 2023), huh?

WWE teased out Randy Orton maybe not returning for the main event War Games match, then actually left him in the back for the entirety of that match, teased a Money in the Bank cash-in, then actually had him show up. It was electric!

That they teased this played right into all the heavy speculation among the fan base that CM Punk could possibly return during the show. When Orton actually arrived and worked the match, that seemed to be the end of it. The copyright logo popped up on the screen, that was it. Except Punk actually did show up, to a thunderous ovation, some folks still in the ring got real mad about it, and everything has changed now. It was electric!

Caught up in between these two things was Drew McIntyre.

McIntyre’s story has revolved around being upset that he hasn’t gotten a fair shake due to The Bloodline, and he’s wanted revenge against Jey Uso for taking his big moment away from him back at Clash at the Castle last year. He aligned with The Judgment Day to get it.

He did not end up getting it.

As mentioned, Orton did return, helping to lead the babyface team of Uso, Cody Rhodes, Sami Zayn, and Seth Rollins to defeat McIntyre & Judgment Day. Immediately after the match, McIntyre was spotted by fans storming to the back.

Then, according to a report from PW Insider, he also stormed out of the building. He was apparently seen “slamming his locker room door” before leaving the arena entirely. Fightful echoed that reporting, stating he was “visibly upset even backstage” after the show before leaving.

Because this is pro wrestling, the first question to ask is if this is all part of the storyline. That certainly seems to be the case, especially considering there are videos floating around social media that appear to show a cameraman waving a signal to McIntyre before he could be seen storming out. This was shortly after the finish and just before Punk’s return.

We likely won’t have to wait long to find out if there’s something more here. </textarea>
