                <textarea id="text" readonly> Special tips and secrets

To make Kadha Prasad, keep in mind that first prepare sugar syrup. Simply add 1 cup of sugar to 2 cups of water and boil it.

Sieve the flour first and then keep it in a separate bowl. Also keep in mind that for this you will need pure desi ghee.

While frying the flour in ghee, keep in mind that the flour has to be fried until its texture becomes a little sandy or rather coarse. Your prasad should not be too thin.

Fry the flour until it turns dark brown. Before adding sugar syrup to it, it will remain raw.

To make Kadha Prasad, take flour which has been ground in a mill. Since coarse flour is required to make Prasad, the same flour is good. If you do not have flour milled then you can take finely ground flour. When adding flour to ghee, cook it while stirring well.

Mistakes to avoid while making Kadha Prasad

When you make molasses from water and sugar, remember not to make syrup out of it. Just have to dissolve sugar in water.

While frying the flour, never keep it on high flame. Flour burns very quickly. Always keep it on medium to low flame.

When the colour of the flour starts turning brown, turn it to low flame, add molasses to it and keep stirring. Doing this too fast may cause lumps to form in it.

Do not leave the ladle even once, otherwise your halwa will burn.
