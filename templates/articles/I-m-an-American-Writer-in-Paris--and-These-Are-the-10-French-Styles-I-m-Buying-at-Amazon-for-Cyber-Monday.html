                <textarea id="text" readonly> In France, les soldes (sale season) only takes place twice a year: in early January and summer. Since moving to Paris, the one thing I miss most about the U.S. is how sales are shopping celebrations sprinkled throughout the year. Enter: Cyber Monday, a Black Friday alternative we can take advantage of all around the world without fighting off crowds sample sale-style at shops — or even leaving the comfort of my Parisian apartment couch.

Sure, this is a great time to snag airline and hotel deals for holiday travel, but I see it as an incentive for a spree to shop for fashion items I’ve been eyeing throughout the year — or discover ones I didn’t know I need and now can’t live without. As a travel journalist who splits winters hopping back and forth from Paris to Miami and the Caribbean, my Away carry-on quickly fills up with wardrobe pieces that double for two very different locales — which is how I justify stocking up on capsule pieces during Cyber Monday sales at Amazon.

From a reversible leather tote to stylish ski pants and a packable, quilted lightweight puffer, here are the 10 fashion finds I’m getting this year before the price goes back up.

Reversible Faux Leather Tote

Amazon

Whether you’re hopping on a flight or sightseeing, the right bag makes all the difference — and a roomy, lightweight vegan leather tote like this one is a sleek option to carry essentials like chargers, a water bottle, a makeup bag, and yes, the most French accessory of all, a bottle of wine. Since it’s reversible, you can choose between cognac or black, so it can work for any outfit or occasion. Reviewers have praised this purse since it “carries a lot without cutting into my shoulder” and “feels like real leather.” One shopper even said, “I got this identical bag about 10 years ago, and even though I own about 40 purses, it’s literally the only one I use 99 percent of the time.”

A go-to when lugging my laptop to Soho House Paris to work, a tote like this also doubles as a beach bag — it’s water-resistant with an anti-scratch surface, so no need to worry about sand and saltwater causing discoloration or leaving marks. A two-for-one deal, it even comes with a detachable mini zipper pouch perfect for safeguarding wallets and cell phones.

Thigh-High Suede Boots

Amazon

Last year, my big shoe splurge was a pair of Stuart Weitzman over-the-knee suede boots. I had been admiring them for some time, but I wasn’t sure if they’d flatter legs that aren’t supermodel length. If you’ve been curious whether you can pull off a look like this, I’m here to shower you with plenty of support. Not ready to take the plunge on a pricey pair of boots just yet? These best-selling lookalikes at Amazon are so popular, they’ve received more than 8,000 reviews of praise. As one shopper commented, “I have trouble finding knee-high boots that fit my legs and these are so comfortable and fit perfectly.”

The ties at the top allow you to tighten the boot so they don’t slouch down, and the short heel and rounded toe make these wearable enough for a day of sightseeing — or an evening out. I often wear mine in winter with sheer black tights and leather shorts or a thigh-grazing mini dress. You can also pair them with a boxy sweater dress and long coat or trench. The mix of lengths and layers is striking and sexy for a dinner date at a swanky new restaurant while still appropriate for a day of gallery hopping around Paris or lunch with family and friends. Plus, at $38, they’re one of the best Cyber Monday steals I’ve come across yet.

Faux Leather Shorts

Amazon

Textured separates like a suede skirt or velvet blazer are an easy way to elevate an outfit. For fall and winter, high-waisted leather shorts have become my wardrobe staple. A versatile piece that can be dressed up or down, they’re great on warmer days with a tucked-in tee or cropped knit top and transition to fall or winter when worn with tights and boots. I often style mine with a thin sweater, long trench, and thigh-high boots out for lunch in Paris or a gallery opening or events like Art Basel Miami.

One shopper raved, “These shorts are so comfortable and super flattering! I just got back from a two-week trip to Europe and I wore these more than anything else in my suitcase."

Striped Oversized Sweater

Amazon

You can never have too many basics in your closet, and one that’s practically a neutral in France is a striped, oversized sweater reminiscent of a French marinière. Whether you wear it over wide-leg pants or jeans, this is one versatile winter piece you’ll never regret adding to your travel wardrobe. It’s made of a nylon-viscose blend that’s machine washable, which is always a bonus for no-fuss care. And at 42 percent off, it’s a steal right now.

Leather Penny Loafers

Amazon

The one element of my travel uniform I always struggle with is shoes. Finding versatile footwear that transcends seasons and can be worn when I’m home in Paris or while on the road isn’t easy. This is where French practicality comes into play. Loafers are just as much about comfort as they are about fashion. A classic, moccasin-style slip-on shoe like this one — which is 53 percent off at Amazon for Cyber Monday — is my alternative to sneakers. Great for airports and train stations, these round-toe, lightweight leather loafers are soft and flexible, yet still offer support thanks to a cushioned insole.

As one shopper said, “I've worn these a few times, and they are like walking on clouds.” I’m loving the gorgeous camel color, since it’ll pair with practically anything, from denim shorts and a structured white button-down to chocolate-colored corduroy wide-leg pants or a sweater dress in fall.

Quilted Lightweight Puffer Jacket

Amazon

In a city like Paris where the temperature can shift dramatically throughout the day, layering — especially in the cooler months — is key. A quilted, lightweight puffer like this one at Amazon is great to wear on its own during that in-between time as seasons shift, or layered under a thicker wool coat when the weather dips. Falling just below the hip, this shorter, fitted jacket almost has an equestrian feel that can make any ensemble look polished — I’d pair it with a flirty, pleated mini skirt and ankle boots or cropped jeans and a crewneck sweater. Two side zippers are convenient additions for storing travel essentials, and snaps on the cuff add a stylish design element to the timeless piece. Easy to throw in a travel tote or pack in a carry-on when you don’t have space for a thicker jacket, this puffer will be like my second skin this season.

The North Face Ski Pants

Ski gear is among the priciest of purchases this season — which usually makes it my Cyber Monday shopping priority. Even if you’re not planning to hit the slopes, it’s worth investing in a few quality basics that will keep you warm and cozy in the cold during activities like snowshoeing or glacier trekking (if this wasn’t on your bucket list already, now’s the time to add it). I purchased snow pants similar to this pair from Arctix last fall, and they were my go-to all winter while skiing in St. Moritz, Switzerland, and the Italian Dolomites.

Waterproof and breathable, these insulated pants kept me warm and dry — and kept snow out of my boots thanks to gaiters with gripper elastic. As someone on the shorter side (I’m 5’1”), finding pants — especially ones designed for performance like these — can be a challenge. What’s great about this style is that you can choose the length (short is perfect for my frame) and fit, whether you want something slim or straight leg (and it’s also available in extended plus sizes).

After dubbing them the "best cold-weather pants," one reviewer shared, "I needed a pair that was waterproof and windproof and these snow pants were perfect for my trip to Iceland...the water from snow, ice, rain and waterfalls just beaded off without being absorbed. No wind got in either! They are heavy and bulky, but I was comfortable for days wearing these; I could still bend and sit."

Crocodile Crossbody Clutch

Amazon

A similar look to some of the popular designer styles from Dior and Hermès, this crocodile-embossed vegan leather crossbody is the perfect holiday season staple since it goes from day to night and doubles as a top-handle clutch (unclip the strap and you have a whole new look!). Large enough to carry a phone, keys, slim card holder wallet, and lipstick, this stylish accessory adds instant polish to any outfit.

As one reviewer said, “Perfect size for me — I’ve been looking for this little bag for a long time.” The magnetic closure also helps prevent pickpocketing while on the métro in Paris — the reason I opt for bags with a zipper or secure flap like this one.

Safari-Style Jacket

Amazon

One piece of outerwear that doesn’t get the love it deserves is a safari jacket (in olive green, obviously). This look continues to resurface on runways, and while designers have added their own spin, the beauty of a safari jacket is that it's effortlessly chic — you don’t need to dress it up too much to make it a statement piece. I’ve had one that I’ve rolled up and taken in my travel tote everywhere from my recent safari in South Africa’s Singita Sabi Sand to Patagonia and the Greek islands.

On sale for Cyber Monday, this zip-up, anorak-style jacket features a drawstring waist and sleeves with Velcro, so you can adjust the fit to your figure. Four front patch pockets can serve as design details or useful storage for small items like AirPods while traveling. Lightweight and machine washable, this is a great piece to layer in fall to dress up jeans and a white T-shirt (taking inspiration from celebrities’ off-duty look). As one shopper agreed, “I was surprised at the structure — not too thin or flimsy. Looking forward to wearing this in the spring and fall as a great way to elevate a jeans and sneakers look.”

Dyson-style Hair Dryer

Amazon

I recently traveled with a stylish French journalist whose quick (and somewhat intimidating) quips, matter-of-fact way of speaking, and impeccable fashion was like a mix of The Devil Wears Prada’s Miranda Priestly and Emily in Paris boss Sylvie Grateau. This woman embodied French chic — from her subtle aura of perfume (she has a signature scent for each season, naturally) to label-free tunic dresses found near her home in Paris’s up-and-coming Pigalle neighborhood. When I complimented her silk turbans, which she color-coordinates to match each ensemble, she replied simply, “I didn’t have time to go to the salon.”

The French may champion a makeup-free look, but their tousled tresses aren’t so effortless — French coiffeurs have mastered the art of achieving perfectly imperfect hair. I normally only splurge on le brushing (a blow-dry) when I get my hair cut, so the rest of the time, my hair is slicked back into a bun or my curls are at the mercy of the elements (and a little help from Ouai Wave Spray). When a friend introduced me to the Dyson Supersonic hair dryer and its magical attachments, I was instantly converted. As someone who has never been able to master a curling iron or blow dryer, it was a game-changer. This compact version at Amazon is lightweight and portable if you want to pack it in your carry-on — and at $34, it’s just a fraction of the Dyson’s very steep price point. More than 2,500 five-star reviews agree: “This little cutie is just as good as a Dyson. I can say that because I have used my sister’s Dyson dryer and loved it,” raves one shopper.
