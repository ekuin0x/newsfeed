                <textarea id="text" readonly> 2023 is almost over, and what an incredible year it's been for gaming. Per usual though, December is light on major releases. In fact, it has fewer video game releases than every other month. That said, whether you're gaming on Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4, Xbox One, or one of the two Xbox Series consoles, there's still plenty to check out. In particular, it's a great month for VR. To this end, a long-awaited survival game is supposedly finally releasing, Avatar is getting a long overdue video game treatment, and we can finally decorate our digital real estate investments.

Below, you can check out all of December 2023's most notable video games releases, or more specifically, the 10 most compelling video game releases next month. Naturally, this is not an exhasutive list, but a curated list meant to highlight what is worth your attention.

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora:

About: "Abducted by the human militaristic corporation known as the RDA, you, a Na'vi, were trained and molded to serve their purpose. Fifteen years later, you are free, but find yourself a stranger in your birthplace. Reconnect with your lost heritage, discover what it truly means to be Na'vi, and join other clans to protect Pandora from the RDA."

The Day Before:

Disney Dreamlight Valley:

About: "Disney Dreamlight Valley is a hybrid between a life-sim and an adventure game rich with quests, exploration, and engaging activities featuring Disney and Pixar friends, both old and new. Once an idyllic land, Dreamlight Valley was a place where Disney and Pixar characters lived in harmony-until the Forgetting. Night Thorns grew across the land and severed the wonderful memories tied to this magical place. With nowhere else to go, the hopeless inhabitants of Dreamlight Valley retreated behind locked doors in the Dream Castle. Now it's up to you to discover the stories of this world and bring the magic back to Dreamlight Valley!"

In a post-apocalyptic world where every bullet counts, experience the thrill of realistic combat as you wield all-new and fan-favorite weapons-from shotguns to machetes and flamethrowers. An all-new melee combat system will push you to the very brink of your limits as you slay Freds (the zombies, in case you didn't know) like never before in full, next-gen mutilation glory!

Release Date: December 7 via PlayStation VR 2, Quest, and SteamVR

Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2:

About: "Our primary goal when designing Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2 was to make it dynamic enough that players would want to dive in repeatedly. For more than a few minigames, we've kept the spirit of the original to take players through the curated experiences we love crafting. However, ensuring the vast majority of games would be different each time you played was our main target."
