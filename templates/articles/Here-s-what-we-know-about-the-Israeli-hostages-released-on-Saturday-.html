                <textarea id="text" readonly> Sharon Avigdori, a sister of Avshalom Haran and a drama therapist, was visiting her family in Be’eri with her daughter, Noam Avigdori, when they were seized.

Sharon Avigdori works with people on the autism spectrum and lives in Hod Hasharon, in central Israel. Her husband, Hen Avigdori, and their son Omer, 16, had stayed home that weekend.

Mr. Avigdori, a television writer, told The Jerusalem Post this month that he was “a man on a mission” to bring back his wife and daughter. He said his wife’s work “changes the world.”

He described his daughter as a young socialite and a top student. “She likes learning, she is hilarious, she has a very sarcastic sense of humor, she cracks me up,” he said.

Emily Hand, 9

Emily Hand, an Irish Israeli, was kidnapped from a sleepover at a friend’s house in Kibbutz Be’eri and turned 9 while in captivity.

Her family initially believed she had been killed in the attack, but was later informed that she was kidnapped. Her older sister, Natalie Hand, told Israel’s Channel 12 that the family had cried for Emily when it was informed she had been killed.

“We were told that she had been murdered; we were in mourning,” she said. Then, “on Oct. 31, they told us that it was highly likely that she had been abducted.”

Speaking at a news conference at the Israeli Embassy in London recently, her father, Thomas Hand, said, “I’m going to pull every little string that I can for my own daughter, and hopefully that helps the rest as well.”

Ireland’s president met with Mr. Hand in recent weeks.

Maya Regev, 21

Maya Regev was at the Tribe of Nova music festival on Oct. 7 when Hamas attackers infiltrated Israel and massacred hundreds of young festivalgoers. Her brother, Itay, with whom she attended the festival, is still believed to be held in Gaza.

Their father, Ilan Regev Derby, described in October being haunted by the last conversation he had with Ms. Regev, which he recorded on his phone. She called as the gunmen closed in.

In one Hamas video, Itay is shown, hands bound, in the back of a pickup, alive. Another friend they attended the festival with, Omer Shem Tov, is also still believed to be held in Gaza.

Mirit Regev, Maya’s mother, expressed the mixed feelings of many families in a statement on Sunday:

“I’m excited and happy that Maya is on her way to us now. Nonetheless, my heart is split because my son, Itay, is still in Hamas’s captivity in Gaza,” she said, adding, “I am going to hug Maya so hard. We will not stop until Itay and all the hostages get back home.” </textarea>
