                <textarea id="text" readonly> The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are the best Samsung wireless earbuds unless you're looking for a better value-for-money product or exchangeable ear wings. In which case, you'd want to buy the Galaxy Buds FE instead.

Spec-wise, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are the superior solution, as they boast better audio quality and a case with wireless charging capabilities. However, these extra features come at a cost.

The good news is that this Black Friday weekend, you can buy the premium Galaxy Buds 2 Pro at a much lower price and get a whole lot more value for your money. Here's all you need to know.

Story continues after our Galaxy Buds 2 Pro review video

Right now and for a limited time, you can save $70 on the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro without doing anything extra. This is a flat, limited-time price cut Samsung has in store when you buy the earbuds. No Offers Program or trade-in required.

This $70 discount brings the price of the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro down to $159 (or $6.67 a month with Samsung Finance). However, if you are interested in a trade-in, you can save an extra $50 or $75 if you have an old pair of earbuds or wired headphones you can exchange.

With the flat $70 discount and the extra $75 off from trade-in, you're now looking at a price lower than the Galaxy Buds FE. You can buy the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro for just $92 instead of the usual $229.

This is the best Galaxy Buds 2 Pro deal you can get, so make sure you hit the “Buy” button below before the offer ends. And if you visit Samsung's online shop using a mobile device, make sure to give the official Shop Samsung app a try. You might be able to get an even better deal or exclusive bonuses. </textarea>
