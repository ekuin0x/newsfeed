                <textarea id="text" readonly> 5.1 to DP Conway , edged and Rahul has taken an absolute blinder diving to his left. Conway hangs his bat out to drive but Shami bowls this full and gets it to move off the seam, Conway goes for the drive and ends up getting a thick edge. Excellent anticipation from Rahul was the key to making that catch possible. . 30 / 1

7.4 to R Ravindra , gets the nick, Shami with the double-strike! Angled in from around the stumps, Ravindra is forced to play at that because Shami is probing away, the seam position is excellent, there's a hint of movement to get the edge and Rahul takes a good, low catch. . 39 / 2

32.2 to KS Williamson , flicked straight to Surya at deep square! Wankhede has found its voice as has the rest of India, possibly. It's a hittable delivery, Williamson looks to pick him into the short square boundary but may have hit it off the bottom and it finds Surya's lap at the ropes. Shami dropped him a while earlier but has breathed some life into India with this massive, massicve strike. . 220 / 3

32.4 to TWM Latham , struck on the pad and given! It's a double-strike for Shami. Latham plays all around one that comes back in with the angle. It's so plumb that he doesn't even bother reviewing. It skids back in to hit him on the pad, would've crashed into middle and leg. . 220 / 4

45.2 to DJ Mitchell , Jadeja pockets another catch in the deep. Five-wicket haul for Shami. Pitched up on the pads, Mitchell picks it up and whips it to Jadeja at deep midwicket. End of a terrific innings from Mitchell. He raises his bat. Kane and Co are up on their feet in the dressing room, appluding Mitchell. Shami, meanwhile, holds the ball up and celebrates . 306 / 7

48.2 to TG Southee , Make that six wickets for Shami. Full and outside off, Southee has a big drive and nicks it behind. Rahul dives across to his right to pouch a smart, low catch. Shami is the second Indian bowler, after Nehra, to collect six wickets in World Cups . 321 / 9 </textarea>
