                <textarea id="text" readonly> Just call me your local Italophile because Italian style is just about all I can think about at the moment. There's no question that Europeans in general have an A+ sense of style, but it's the Italians that seem to posses an effortless glamour that's having a huge influence on what I wear and how I shop right now. I grew up surrounded by a big Italian American family and have spent a significant amount of time living and visiting our family in Italy, so I consider myself to be well-versed in their particular brand of elevated polish.

Since shopping is just what I do, I thought it would be fun to put my knowledge of Italian style to use and imagine the types of fashion items they would put in their carts when shopping on Nordstrom. With their epic Cyber Monday deals in full force, there's a dizzying number of discounts to take advantage of, so if you're anything like me and want to shop like a chic Roman or Milanese, then you're in for a treat because the e-tailer is home to tons of Italian style staples right now. </textarea>
