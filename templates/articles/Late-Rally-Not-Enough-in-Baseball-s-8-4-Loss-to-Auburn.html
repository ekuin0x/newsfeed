                <textarea id="text" readonly> TUSCALOOSA, Ala. – Alabama's offense rallied late, but the comeback fell short in an 8-4 loss to Auburn on Friday night at Sewell-Thomas Stadium. The Crimson Tide is now 24-11 on the season and 4-9 in Southeastern Conference play.

Auburn used a home run in the second to take an early 2-0 lead and added two more with a two-out, two-run single in the top of the seventh. The Tigers then plated one in the eighth and added three in the ninth for an 8-0 advantage. Alabama was able to load the bases with two down in the seventh and reached a pair with two outs in the eighth but was held off the scoreboard until the ninth. The Crimson Tide rallied for four in the final frame and had the tying run at the plate but a flyout to left ended the ballgame at 8-4.

The win went to Auburn starter Tommy Vail (3-1), who tossed 6.2 scoreless innings. Luke Holman (5-2) was tagged with the loss despite another solid start. The sophomore allowed four runs on four hits and three walks with six strikeouts across 6.2 innings and a career-high 89 pitches.

From Head Coach Brad Bohannon

" Luke Holman gave us a good start, and I really liked the fight we showed late in the game. But we just didn't show enough fight before the ninth and didn't do enough offensively tonight. They tried to help us, gave us eight free baserunners, but we just didn't hit enough balls hard and didn't have enough of the good at-bats that we needed."

How It Happened

T2 | Chris Stanfield gave the Tigers an early lead with a two-out, two-run home run to left-center. (2-0, Auburn)

T7 | The Tigers delivered a two-run single with two down to widen the gap. (4-0, Auburn)

T8 | A two-out single through the left side added one more for AU. (5-0, Auburn)

T9 | The leadoff man walked before a sac bunt moved him into scoring position. An error then allowed one Tiger run to score before a home run from Cole Foster added two more. (8-0, Auburn)

B9 | Alabama loaded the bases with Will Hodo pushing a run across on a hit-by-pitch. Jim Jarvis then singled in one more run before a two-out walk from Drew Williamson crossed a third tally. Ed Johnson was next up, recording a hit-by-pitch himself to add one more run. (8-4, Alabama)

Postgame Notes

Tonight's game was a sellout. It is Alabama's first sellout at home since May 22, 2021, when Sewell-Thomas Stadium was at limited capacity due to social distancing. The Tide's last sellout without any restrictions came on May 6, 2018, against Mississippi State.

Luke Holman tossed a career-high 89 pitches in his start. The sophomore's previous high was 85 last week against Mississippi State on April 7.
