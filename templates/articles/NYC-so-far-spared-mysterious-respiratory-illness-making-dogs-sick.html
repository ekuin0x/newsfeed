                <textarea id="text" readonly> Think twice before sending your dogs to kennels, doggy day care and dog runs this holiday season.

A contagious kennel cough is spreading through the country, with cases reported in several states including Virginia and Massachusetts.

Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease Complex, also known as kennel cough, has not hit New York City yet, but it’s likely just a matter of time, according to Dr. Lawrence Zola, medical director at University Animal Hospital on the Upper East Side.

“Dogs travel a lot in this holiday season and many are boarding their dogs in kennels,” Zola said. “If a dog coughs in a room with 30 other dogs, it’s going to spread.”

Symptoms include sneezing, lethargy, loss of appetite, low-grade fever, runny nose and gunk around the eyes. Zola strongly recommends immediately bringing a dog to the vet for further evaluation if any of those symptoms appear. Even a seemingly healthy dog with no symptoms can be contagious.

The only way to prevent the highly contagious canine influenza is by keeping pups away from other dogs. Dogs should not share water and food bowls. The disease can spread through contact or the air.

If there is no option but to board a pet over the holidays, Zola said to consult your vet about your dog’s individual risk and exposure. Also make sure your furry friend is up on its vaccines such as Bordetella, influenza and parainfluenza, which protect against related diseases.

Not much is known yet about the disease – whether it's caused by a virus or a bacteria or whether it’s something new or a previously known illness. According to Zola, other states have done PCR tests on afflicted pets, but the organism causing the condition has not yet been isolated for examination.

“It’s most likely not contagious to humans, but if it’s a virus, it could mutate,” Zola said. “It’s highly contagious and if one dog gets it, it can be spread through picking up another dog’s toy.”

The cases of the mystery canine influenza have been reported as very mild. Coughing for a few days is the most common symptom. Charlottesville’s Autumn Trails Veterinary Center, which has reported more than 150 cases in the past month in its own community as well as more than 1,000 in surrounding areas, reported that the disease’s incubation period is seven to 10 days and symptoms can last up to 21 days.

The illness is rarely fatal, but tends to be severe in puppies and older dogs with other health problems. </textarea>
