                <textarea id="text" readonly> Prime Video has released 9 first-look photos of the new survival series Fallout from Westworld creators Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy and their Kilter Films. The show will premiere on April 12.

Based on the video game series of the same name, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there’s almost nothing left to have. Two hundred years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind — and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird and highly violent universe waiting for them.

Set in the future post-apocalyptic Los Angeles and the world of Fallout, the series is an original story that will be part of the canon of the games.

The cast is led by Ella Purnell in the role of Lucy; Aaron Moten in the role of Maximus; Walton Goggins plays The Ghoul; and Kyle MacLachlan plays Overseer Hank.

Additional cast includes Moisés Arias, Sarita Choudhury, Michael Emerson, Leslie Uggams, Frances Turner, Dave Register, Zach Cherry, Johnny Pemberton, Rodrigo Luzzi, Annabel O’Hagan and Xelia Mendes-Jones.

Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner serve as executive producers, writers and co-showrunners. Nolan and Joy executive produce via Kilter Films under their Amazon overall deal. Athena Wickham of Kilter Films also executive produces along with Todd Howard for Bethesda Game Studios and James Altman for Bethesda Softworks. Amazon and Kilter Films produce in association with Bethesda Game Studios and Bethesda Softworks. Jonathan Nolan directed the first three episodes of the epic series.
