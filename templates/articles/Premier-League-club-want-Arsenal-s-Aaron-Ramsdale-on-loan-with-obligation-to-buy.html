Wolves are sounding out Arsenal as they eye a January deal for Aaron Ramsdale.

Current Molineux No1 Jose Sa is wanted by several Saudi-based clubs and Gary O'Neil is keen to cash in. Wolves have slapped a £35million asking price on his head.

However, the Premier League outfit are increasingly confident the Portuguese ace will be Middle East bound in the New Year. If Sa packs his bags, Ramsdale has been earmarked as the top target to replace him between the sticks.

The England international's future in north London remains up in the air following the arrival of David Raya from Brentford.

Ramsdale is happy to fight for his place at the Emirates but would prefer guaranteed first-team action, which is no longer a given under Mikel Arteta.

What do you think is a fair value for Aaron Ramsdale in the transfer market now? Let us know in the comments section.

Wolves are keen to secure a loan deal with an obligation to buy as they continue to juggle their finances.

But it's understood club bigwigs believe a move back to the Midlands could be a compelling option for the Stoke-on-Trent born star. </textarea>
