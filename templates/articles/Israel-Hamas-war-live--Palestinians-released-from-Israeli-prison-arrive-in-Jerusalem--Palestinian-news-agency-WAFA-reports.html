30m ago 23.48 GMT Israeli troops killed six Palestinians in the occupied West Bank on Saturday, the Palestinian ministry of health said. Agence France-Presse reports: A 25-year-old doctor was killed early in the morning outside his home in Qabatiya, near Jenin, a stronghold of Palestinian armed groups in the north of the territory, the ministry said. Another Palestinian was killed in el-Bireh, near Ramallah. Four people were also killed by Israeli army fire in Jenin, during an incursion by a large number of armoured vehicles into the town, which was recently the scene of the deadliest Israeli raid in the West Bank in almost 20 years. Witnesses told AFP on Saturday that the Israeli army was surrounding Jenin’s public hospital and the Ibn Sina clinic, and that soldiers were searching ambulances. They also reported heavy fighting with automatic weapons. The West Bank has seen an uptick in violence since the October 7 cross-border attack on Israel by Hamas last month, in which militants from the Gaza Strip killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, according to the Israeli authorities. Israel has since responded with a bombing and land campaign in Gaza, killing nearly 15,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas government. All the while, some 230 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed by Israeli settlers and soldiers, according to the Palestinian Authority’s ministry of health.



1h ago 23.18 GMT Palestinians released from Israeli prison arrive in Jerusalem - Palestinian news agency WAFA Al Jazeera TV broadcast live footage late on Saturday of a bus that it says was carrying Palestinians released from an Israeli prison passing in the West Bank town of Beitunia, among celebrating Palestinian crowds, Reuters reports. Separately, a number of newly released Palestinians have arrived in Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian news agency WAFA.



1h ago 23.13 GMT A nine-year-old Irish-Israeli girl was among the group of hostages released by Hamas on Saturday, Ireland’s prime minister said in a statement. “This is a day of enormous joy and relief for Emily Hand and her family,” said Leo Varadkar, the prime minister of the Republic of Ireland. “An innocent child who was lost has now been found and returned, and we breathe a massive sigh of relief. Our prayers have been answered.” This is a day of enormous joy and relief for Emily Hand and her family. An innocent child who was lost has now been found and returned, and we breathe a massive sigh of relief. Our prayers have been answered. — Leo Varadkar (@LeoVaradkar) November 25, 2023 Emily, who was kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October, turned nine earlier this month while being held captive. Her father, Thomas Hand, who was born in Ireland and later moved to Israel, told the Agence France-Presse earlier this month that initially he had thought his daughter had been killed in the attack. “Later on we had an eyewitness ... [who] saw her being led away by the terrorists, into a van off to Gaza” after the attack on the Be’eri kibbutz, he told AFP.

The ICRC team consisted of eight staff members, including a doctor, travelling in four vehicles, he said. The neutral, Swiss-based organisation already facilitated the release and transfer of Gaza-held hostages and Palestinian detainees on Friday under the terms of a four-day truce.



1h ago 22.48 GMT Dan Sabbagh Relatives of the hostages released by Hamas tonight are celebrating the return of their loved ones. Inbal Tzach, the cousin of Adi Shoham, who was released together with her family from Hamas captivity tonight, announced: Like everyone else we watched our loved ones on their way home. We saw Adi with Nave, Yahal, Shoshan, Noam and Sharon. Of course we are still waiting for Tal to come home, as well as for everyone else. The struggle has not ended. This is the saddest joy and the happiest sadness, but our family is home. Keep fighting with us. We still have a long way to go. This is an emotional evening for the families who received their loved ones tonight. We will continue the struggle until everyone comes home. Zohar Avigdori, uncle of Noam Avigdori and sister-in-law of Sharon Avigdori, who were released from captivity tonight, said: We are very excited, our legs are shaking and we are impatiently waiting to hug our loved ones, Noam and Sharon. We don’t forget for a moment that these are the same legs that will continue the journey to sustain us in the long journey that is still ahead of us - until the safe return of all the hostages.
