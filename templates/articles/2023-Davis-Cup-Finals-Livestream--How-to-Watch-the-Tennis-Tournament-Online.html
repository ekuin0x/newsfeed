2023 Davis Cup Finals Countries, Predictions

The Davis Cup Finals Group Stage features eight national teams playing in Malaga, Spain, with the winners moving onto the quarterfinals, semifinals and then the 2023 Davis Cup final. Canada is the defending Davis Cup champion though they were eliminated by Finland already.

The U.S. has won the Davis Cup a record 32 times and was considered by many to be the favorite this year but the Americans were knocked out in earlier group play. Oddsmakers now predict Australia or Italy to take home the title, with the Canadians also in the mix.

The other countries are Finland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Serbia and Great Britain. Novak Djokovic leads the Serbian team and is coming off a dominant win over Carlos Alcaraz in the ATP Finals last week to retain his World No. 1 ranking. Alcaraz and the Spanish team did not make the Davis Cup finals.

Known as the “World Cup of Men’s Tennis,” the Davis Cup has been played since 1900 and are a counterpart to the women’s Billie Jean King Cup, which was won by Canada this year.
