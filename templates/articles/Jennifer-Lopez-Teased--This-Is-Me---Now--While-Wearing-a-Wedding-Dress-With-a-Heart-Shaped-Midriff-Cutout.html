                <textarea id="text" readonly> Exactly one year after Jennifer Lopez announced that she'd be releasing This Is Me… Now, the pop star finally gave fans an update on the highly-anticipated album with a new teaser — and trust us, it was worth the wait.



On Saturday, J.Lo posted a video reel with a compilation of visuals for the upcoming record on Instagram. In the short clip, text reading, “HEAR IT. SEE IT. LIVE IT,” over a green background (Lopez's "lucky" color) flashed across the screen, before moving to a supercut of footage that showed Lopez dancing in a variety of settings in an array of glamorous outfits.

Our favorite? A white corseted wedding dress she wore during what appeared to be an outdoor ceremony. The gown featured long sheer sleeves, bedazzled detailing below the bust, and an upside-down heart-shaped cutout at the midriff — plus, a matching one on the skirt. J.Lo wore her caramel-colored tresses in a half-up, half-down hairstyle, and accessorized with a pair of diamond earrings, a white veil, and pink bridal bouquet of flowers.



On The JLo

At the end of the video, J.Lo shared a hand-written note that read: “This musical experience is a manifestation, through music, film, and reality, of a life's journey on the search for the truth about love."

This Is Me...Now is a sequel to J.Lo's third studio album This Is Me…Then, which came out in 2002 and included a number of songs inspired by her relationship with Ben Affleck at the time. The two called off their engagement back then, but 20 years later, they reunited and got married, and the new record is inspired by their unlikely love story.



"We captured me at this moment in time when I was reunited with the love of my life and we decided we were going to be together forever. The whole message of the album then is this love exists,” she said in a candid conversation with Zane Lowe last year. “This is a real love. Now I think what the message of the album is very much if you were wondering if you have, like me at times, lost hope, almost given up, don’t. Because true love does exist and some things do last forever and that’s real.”
