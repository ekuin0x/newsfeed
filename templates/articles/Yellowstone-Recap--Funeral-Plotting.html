                <textarea id="text" readonly> In the second of Sunday’s Yellowstone episodes, John was out for blood — specifically, the Beck brothers’.

Yellowstone‘s Dutton Family Tree: Who’s Who On the Hit Series and Its Spinoffs — and How They’re All Related View List

After Malcolm and Teal struck out at Rainwater in order to halt construction on his casino, the Duttons’ gruff patriarch called a meeting with the chief and Dan to suggest that the enemies of his enemy could be his… Well, “friends” would be going too far. Let’s say “coconspirators.” In no time, he’d gotten Dan to voluntarily record himself floating the idea of murder and Thomas to record himself promising to dispose of the bodies on the reservation.

However, John didn’t say anything that would incriminate himself. His reasoning? “I don’t have to say it,” he grumbled. “I’m the one who’s gonna do it.” And he didn’t even know yet that the Becks, off their attack on Beth, were targeting “the one he loves most.” (Guess that leaves Jamie safe and sound!)

‘YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY’ | In other developments in “Behind Us Only Grey,” Monica was so unnerved by the injuries that Beth sustained in the name of “business” that she admitted to Kayce that she wanted to leave the ranch. “This place isn’t a home,” she argued. “It’s a giant Alamo” on which they were all prisoners. But no sooner had her husband agreed to move than John convinced her to stay simply by asking her to give the Duttons a chance.

After seeing how wonderful Rip was with Tate, a deeply upset Beth sought out Jamie, if only to tell him that someday, against all odds, someone would love him — and she couldn’t wait to take that away from him, even if she had to murder it with her own bare hands. And, using his bronc-busting winnings, Jimmy finally paid off his meth-head creditors.
