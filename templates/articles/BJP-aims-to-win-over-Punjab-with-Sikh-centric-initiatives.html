                <textarea id="text" readonly> AMRITSAR: The Punjab unit of the Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) has strategically positioned itself in Sikh politics, aiming to establish a strong foothold within the Panth especially after breaking alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).The BJP not only seeks to win the hearts of the Sikh community but also wants to secure their electoral support.In this endeavor, the BJP state president Ashwani Sharma lavishly praised the Modi government for its commendable efforts in addressing Sikh-centric concerns and prioritizing religious issues of the community, while bestowing them with due honour so that BJP could ultimately solidify its position and garner their support in future elections.Aiming to cultivate a favourable perception among Sikh voters, Sharma on Thursday emphasised the Centre's positive actions and commitment towards Sikh affairs. He was in Amritsar to attend a day-long BJP district executive meeting. He also highlighted the swift development initiatives undertaken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for Punjab.Ashwani enumerated various Sikh-centric issues that were effectively addressed by the Modi government, such as the construction of the Kartarpur Corridor, delivering justice to those responsible for the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, granting Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) status to the Golden Temple, bringing back the saroop of Sri Guru Granth Sahib from war torn Afghanistan, and eliminating the black list. Additionally, he emphasized the grand celebrations of the 550th Gurpurab of Guru Nanak Dev, the 350th Gurpurab of Guru Gobind Singh, and the 400th Gurpurab of Guru Teg Bahadur, both in India and abroad.Furthermore, he acknowledged the announcement of Veer Bal Divas, commemorating the martyrdom day of Chotte Sahibzadae.He attributed these actions to Modi's deep devotion to Sikhism and the profound respect he holds for the Sikh community.The state BJP president also attributed Center governments contribution to the development of Punjab and bringing institutions like IIM, Satellite Centres of PGI, AIIMS in Bathinda, Smart City projects etc.Recognizing Punjab as a sensitive state, he stressed on the need for the BJP's governance in Punjab , assuring that the party would meet the expectations of Punjabis and fulfill their aspirations.In recent times, the BJP has successfully garnered support of several Punjabi Sikh leaders, including those from traditional political parties like SAD and Congress.Capitalizing on this support, the BJP aims not only to amplify the Sikh-centric issues addressed by the Modi government but also to position itself as a viable alternative to SAD, thereby encouraging Sikh voters to consider the BJP as a credible political option. </textarea>
