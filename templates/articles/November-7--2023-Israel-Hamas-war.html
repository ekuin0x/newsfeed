The CIA is working with Israeli intelligence on plans to rescue hundreds of hostages from Hamas, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

CIA Director Bill Burns discussed the hostage release effort with IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi on Tuesday as part of the CIA director's visit to Israel, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari told reporters.

Israel is Burns' first stop as he travels to multiple countries in the region to meet with intelligence counterparts.

Intelligence materials, operational planning as well as other efforts to help with the hostages' release were presented during the meeting between Burns and Halevi.

“Each hostage has their own intelligence file that’s being monitored,” Hagari told reporters Tuesday.

“We’re making our efforts along with the ISA (Israeli Security Agency), the Mossad, we’re together assessing the situation every day to see what we need to adjust, change and plan, in order to fulfill our task – to bring them (hostages) home,” Hagari said.

CNN has reached out to the CIA for comment.

Some context: The IDF estimates 240 Israeli hostages are being held by Hamas in Gaza, including civilian men, women and children.

The militant group has released just four hostages – two elderly Israeli women and an American mother and daughter – while the IDF last week said troops had rescued an Israeli soldier.

Israel has insisted there will be no ceasefire until the hostages are freed. </textarea>
