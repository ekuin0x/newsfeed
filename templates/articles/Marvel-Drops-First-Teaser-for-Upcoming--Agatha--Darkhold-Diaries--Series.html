                <textarea id="text" readonly> Following the confirmation of the WandaVision spinoff series Agatha: Darkhold Diaries back in 2021, Marvel has now released the first teaser preview of what is to come.

The series follows the story of Kathryn Hahn’s character Agatha Harkness. Centering around Agatha, brings Hahn back, a villain from the comics who first debuted in The Fantastic Four. However, Agatha ended up becoming Wanda’s opposite in the series. Agatha becomes the first villain to get its own project at Marvel other than Loki. Since WandaVision ended, the series starring Hahn has been in development, going through a number of titles and release date changes. In 2021, it was called Agatha: House of Harkness.

WandaVision‘s head writer Jac Schaeffer returns as the screenwriter and executive producer on the series. The promo takes fans on a behind-the-scenes look. Hahn shares in the promo, “We knew we had something special on our hands, but I think we were all flabbergasted by the reception. People were hungry for something that felt nostalgic and something that everybody coudl sit around and watch and wait for on Friday nights.”
