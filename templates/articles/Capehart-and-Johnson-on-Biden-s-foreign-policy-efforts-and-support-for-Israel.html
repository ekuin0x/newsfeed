                <textarea id="text" readonly> Jonathan Capehart:

He can resist that pressure. He will resist that pressure. And he should resist that pressure.

Look, I would say to my friends, my Democratic friends, that we have to remember that President Biden is president of the United States, not the president of Israel. He has no control over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He can strongly suggest. He can strongly talk to him behind the scenes, more strongly than the words he uses, the president uses in public.

But President Biden is doing absolutely everything he can to encourage a small-D democratic nation, which has its own national security interests, to act in the best interests of small-D democratic values.

And I would also say to my Democratic friends and to others, you got to remember, for all the talk about President Biden being oh so old and he's too old for the job, well, his 36 years in the Senate, eight years as vice president of the United States is coming in handy right now, when we most need it.

This is the time when President Biden is at his best. He knows what he's doing. And I just wish that Democrats in general and the American public in particular would give him the grace and give him the room to exert American will and American pressure as much as he can on a situation that is infinitely more complex than a lot of his critics give it credit for. </textarea>
