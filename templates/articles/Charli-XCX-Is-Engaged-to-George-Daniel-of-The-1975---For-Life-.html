                <textarea id="text" readonly> Earlier this year Charli XCX released the single “Welcome to My Island (Remix)” with George Daniel in which she sings, “It was love at first sight from the moment we kissed / I want a white dress, country side house, and kids” — and now wedding bells are in their future!

PEOPLE confirms the pop star, 31, and the drummer of The 1975, 33, are engaged.

The “Speed Drive” singer first quietly shared the news on Monday with a post of her engagement ring on her private Instagram intended for her fans and later announced it by sharing photos with the indie-pop artist and producer on her public Instagram on Tuesday morning.

In her first post, the hitmaker shared a casual selfie, holding up her hand and flashing a diamond ring. In her more official announcement on social media, the alt-pop singer shared a carousel of the two embracing and a tray of tea featuring a box with an engagement ring, seemingly revealing how the producer proposed.

She shared a cheeky confirmation in the caption, adding, "charli xcx and george daniel f---ing for life!!!"

The 1975 frontman Matty Healy commented on the photos with "I cry 🥺"

The engagement comes several months after the singer (whose real name is Charlotte Aitchison) jokingly commented on the "About You" band's now-archived tour announcement on Instagram, "Stop touring, George needs to buy a ring."

The British musicians first connected in 2021 while working on the single “Spinning.” The collaborative, one-off track featured Charli XCX, The 1975 and No Rome and was co-produced by the Filipino singer, Healy and Daniel.

Although it is unclear when the couple’s creative partnership turned romantic, the “Unlock It” singer confirmed their relationship by sharing photos vacationing together on Instagram in May 2022 after Daniel supported her at her Saturday Night Live performance that March.

Since then, the couple has continued to work on music together: Daniel produced a handful of tracks on the hyperpop superstar’s 2022 album Crash, they teamed up for the song “Hot Girl (Bodies Bodies Bodies)” off the soundtrack for the 2022 A24 horror film Bodies Bodies Bodies and the early 2023 remix of Caroline Polachek’s “Welcome to My Island” and, most recently, Daniel was among the co-producers/songwriters on the singer’s song with Sam Smith, “In the City.”

The two have also offered insights into their relationship over the past year and a half with posts on social media and in interviews.

Shortly after The 1975 released their 2022 single “I’m in Love with You” in September 2022, the drummer/producer shared his first photo on Instagram of himself and the Pop 2 star. Along with a photo of the two embracing, he captioned the post, “IILWY 💚.”

Meanwhile, the singer-songwriter has shared adorable shots of them vacationing, enjoying Fashion Week events together across the globe and working in the studio, as well as fun TikToks of them promoting their songs together and dancing.

She’s also spoken about how their relationship has influenced her as an artist. In a May 2023 interview with The Sun, she revealed how Daniel has inspired her creative process.

“Now that I’m in a relationship with another musician he’s influenced me a lot with his process and how he and his band work,” she told the outlet. “It’s really different to how I work and that has definitely influenced me and my process. I used to be very, ‘Quick, quick, quick, album a month, let’s go.’ Now I’m like, ‘Oh, maybe it’s cool to take some time and live in the music that you create.’ My process is definitely evolving.”

The “Beg for You” artist also opened up about how “in love” she is in a February 2023 interview with the Sydney Morning Herald.

When talking about her and Daniel’s latest track together, “Welcome to My Island (Remix),” she said, “I want to be wifed up, I want to have a big fat belly with a baby in it. I don’t really want to live in the countryside, that’s the only lie in that because I love cities. But yeah, I’m just so in love right now and I think I’d be a really hot mum… so why not just put it all into a Caroline Polachek remix, you know?” </textarea>
