                <textarea id="text" readonly> For years, I lived in a house with six roommates who would take turns cooking for the group each night. I was used to making giant portions of pasta, stir-fry, and more, but since moving in with my partner six months ago, I’ve had to acclimate to cooking for two. From small filets of fish to sheet pan dinners, our comparatively mini meals fit on a single oven rack and take so much less time to prep.

Now that I’m making such small portions, waiting for our large oven to heat up and cook our food to perfection feels like a waste of time. But since I received this multifunctional appliance from Breville for my birthday in September, I’ve baked, broiled, and air fried nearly all of our meals in it for faster, crispier results.

Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Toaster Oven

With 11 unique cooking settings, this small but mighty machine can make almost anything. And at 15 by 20 by 11 inches, it fits neatly onto my countertop but is still somehow large enough to fit an entire rotisserie chicken or 13 inch personal pan pizza.

Since it’s so compact, it heats up in a flash and can reduce cooking time by up to 30%, according to the brand. And unlike a traditional oven, this appliance crisps up potatoes, chicken, and more with little to no oil required.

While I’ve cooked with a variety of air fryers and toaster ovens in the past, this one stands out from the pack due to its smart functionality that monitors temperature to eliminate cool spots and heat food evenly. Plus, just like my regular oven, it features a built-in light that can be turned on at any time to check on my food. It also automatically lights up when your timer ends so I can get a clear look at my finished product without having to open the door and let out heat.

I love that it comes complete with clever accessories that only boost its versatility. It features a basket for air fried goodies, an enamel roasting pan, a non-stick pizza pan, a wire rack, and a broiling rack that allow me to experiment and test out all your favorite recipes that would typically be made in the oven.

Whether I’m in the mood to toast a bagel, reheat leftover vegetables, crisp up tofu, or slow cook a whole chicken, this smart oven from Breville can do it all — and fast. Snag yours now that it’s 26% off for Black Friday.
