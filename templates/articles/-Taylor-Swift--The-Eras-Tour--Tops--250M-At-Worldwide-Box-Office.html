                <textarea id="text" readonly> With its seventh weekend numbers tallied, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour has topped the $250M global benchmark. At $250.01M per AMC, the split is a little over $178.2M domestic with $71.8M coming from the international box office.

The highest-grossing concert film ever domestically began worldwide rollout in mid-October, opening to $92.8M in North America for the second-best domestic start for October after Joker, a fantastic debut for a movie that cost between $10M-$20M. At open overseas, it launched to $30.7M from 94 markets in 4,527 venues for a global bow of $123.5M.

Playing across weekends throughout its run, the current frame added another $2.3M domestically and $1.1M in 36 overseas markets. It’s currently the No. 10 film of the year domestically and 19th among U.S. films globally.

The big play for the phenomenon that is Miss Americana was always going to be domestic. Unlike the U.S., tickets didn’t go on sale for Eras Tour abroad until a few days prior to opening. It saw No. 1 openings notably in the UK, Mexico, Germany, Australia and the Philippines.

While NY-based distributor Variance handled the booking for Stateside theaters, Trafalgar in the UK handled overseas distribution of the AMC-brokered movie.

Deadline’s review called it “a complete celebration… that puts Swift’s joy on full display and highlights that, perhaps for the first time, she is taking the stage for no one but herself.”

Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour returns to cinemas on Thursday, November 30. On Monday, Swift announced that the film will begin streaming on December 13 – the superstar’s birthday – and will include three additional songs not in the theatrical release. The on-demand version is currently set for the U.S., Canada and “additional countries to be announced soon.”

Also from AMC, concert documentary movie Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé begins worldwide theatrical rollout on Friday, December 1. </textarea>
