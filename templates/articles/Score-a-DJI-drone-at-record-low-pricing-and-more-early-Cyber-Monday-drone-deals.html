                <textarea id="text" readonly> UPDATE: Nov. 26, 2023, 7:00 a.m. EST This post has been updated with the latest pricing and availability of early Cyber Monday drone deals, including some picks from DJI and Holy Stone on sale at Amazon, Newegg, and more.

Thanksgiving is over and out for another year, and now it's time to shop. We've reviewed thousands (and thousands) of deals for Mashable readers, but this year, Black Friday and early Cyber Monday drone deals have been particularly impressive. DJI is hosting a huge Cyber Monday sale on its most popular drones, and Amazon has dropped prices to match. DJI has options for beginners and professionals alike, and that's just the beginning of what we've found so far.

We've found early Cyber Monday deals on drones that let you save hundreds on 4K aerial cameras, drones for kids, and drone piloting accessories â€” all gathered in one convenient location. To find the best deals on drones this Cyber Monday, read on.

Note: All newly added deals are marked with a âœ¨, while deals with a ðŸ”¥ have dropped to an all-time low price. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.

Best early Cyber Monday deals on drones for kids

Why we like it:

Everyone knows kids spend too much time looking at screens (heck, so do adults). If you're looking for a holiday gift that will get you and your kids outside, then a kid-friendly drone is a perfect gift idea. This drone isn't so expensive that you'll feel the hurt if it crashes and breaks. The controls are also simple enough that older kids can get in on the fun.

Finally, you can control this drone via remote control or through an iOS or Android app.
