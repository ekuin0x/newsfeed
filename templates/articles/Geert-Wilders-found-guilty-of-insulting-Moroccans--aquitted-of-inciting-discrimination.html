                <textarea id="text" readonly> A Dutch appeals court on Friday found far-right leader Geert Wilders guilty of insulting Moroccans but acquitted him of inciting hatred and discrimination.

The court of appeal upheld Wilders’ 2016 conviction for insulting people of Moroccan descent when leading his supports in anti-Moroccans chants, saying his actions went beyond freedom of expression.

However, the court overturned a conviction by the lower court, dismissing prosecution claims that Wilders had incited hatred and discrimination. It also did not hand down a punishment, saying Wilders has already paid a high price for his actions. Wilders has lived under constant police protection for more than a decade.

Wilders said after the ruling that he will appeal to the Supreme Court. “The Netherlands has become a corrupt country,” he said, adding that “this will make me and the PVV stronger.”

Wilders was convicted in 2016 of inciting discrimination at a campaign rally in which he asked supporters whether they wanted more or fewer Moroccans in the country. “Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!” his supporters shouted, to which Wilders said: “Then we’re going to take care of that.”

Judges found him guilty but issued no fine or other penalty. Wilders appealed, seeking to strike the conviction from the record and saying the trial was politically motivated. Prosecutors also appealed, asking the court to convict Wilders on an additional charge of inciting hatred against Moroccans and impose a €5,000 fine.

It has taken almost four years for the case to be completed, after attempts from Wilders’ legal team to have judges removed, one of which was successful, and various other procedural issues.

Wilders, whose Freedom Party (PVV) is the biggest opposition force in the Dutch parliament, has maintained throughout the process that he did nothing wrong, and merely expressed openly what many Dutch people think.

“Today we’ll find out if there’s still a separation of powers and an independent judiciary in the Netherlands, or we have become a corrupt banana republic where the leader of the opposition is sentenced in a political trial,” Wilders tweeted ahead of the hearing. </textarea>
