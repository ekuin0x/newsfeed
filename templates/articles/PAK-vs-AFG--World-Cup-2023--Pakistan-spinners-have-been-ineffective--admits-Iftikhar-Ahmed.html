                <textarea id="text" readonly> Pakistan all-rounder Iftikhar Ahmed has admitted that his team's spinners have been ineffective, leading to a hat-trick of defeats in the ongoing World Cup 2023 in India.

PAK vs AFG, World Cup: Report | Highlights

Afghanistan chased down the 283-run target to register their first-ever win over Pakistan, thus handing the Babar Azam-led side their third in a row in the showpiece event. Pakistan's greatest weakness has been spin. Notably, the 1992 champs lack a true finger spinner, with all-rounders Iftikhar and Mohammad Nawaz splitting the workload.

"We do have finger spinners in our team, including me and (Mohammad) Nawaz. Yes, the role of our spinners hasn't been that effective here. But we will keep trying to improve. That's all we can do," he told reporters after the loss. Pakistan scored 282/7 after deciding to bat first, with half-centuries by Abdullah Shafique and Babar Azam, as well as contributions from lower-order hitters Shadab Khan and Iftikhar.

"Frankly speaking, this was a wicket of 300-plus. But, their bowlers did trouble us. As a batting unit, we need to improve."

Babar Azam and his men have been sloppy on the field, dropping catches, and giving away runs and boundaries. "We made a lot of mistakes during our fielding, I admit. But, we need to improve; that's the only option we have for now. If you are playing against a world-class side, you have to perform at a similar level across departments. Only then you will be able to survive.''

The Men in Green have now reached the 'must-win stage of the World Cup. They must win their remaining games and obtain favorable outcomes in order to advance to the semi-finals, but Iftikhar believes there is still time to recover. </textarea>
