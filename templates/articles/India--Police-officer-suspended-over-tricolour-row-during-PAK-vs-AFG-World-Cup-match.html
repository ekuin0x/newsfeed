                <textarea id="text" readonly> A sub-inspector of Tamil Nadu Police has been shunted out and a probe was initiated against him after he allegedly did not let spectators enter the Chennai cricket stadium with the Indian flag.

The move comes after a video went viral showing the police officer barring the entry of a few cricket fans to the MA Chidambaram Stadium ahead of the Pakistan-Afghanistan World Cup match on Monday (Oct 23).

Clip goes viral

The clip purportedly showed a police officer retrieving two tri-colour flags from a dustbin, while the bystanders questioned who discarded them in the first place. Tamil Nadu Police put the Indian national flag into a dumpster when a cricket fan tried to bring it inside the Chepauk Cricket Stadium in Chennai for the Pakistan vs. Afghanistan match.

Facing heat, he then takes the flag to his police vehicle.

Appropriate action as per law will be taken based on the findings,‚Äù the city police said in a statement on X. The incident mentioned has been brought to notice.

The incident drew wide condemnation, with the state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unit president K Annamalai accusing the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) of ‚Äústooping to an all-new low by banning‚Äù the Indian national flag inside the stadium.

‚ÄúMourning our country‚Äôs independence, burning parts of our Constitution, seeking a separate statehood, and issuing threats that the call for independent statehood is still alive has been DMK or its ideological party‚Äôs way of not wanting TN integrated with our country.‚Äù

‚ÄúThough they've failed miserably in this misadventure, the DMK Govt today stooped to an all-new low by banning entry to our Country‚Äôs Tricolour inside the Chepauk stadium. They hate everything about this great nation, from Sanatana Dharma to our sovereignty and wish to remain a parrot of our coloniser,‚Äù he said.
