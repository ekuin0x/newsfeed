                <textarea id="text" readonly> When it comes to maximizing your Cyber Week savings, a savvy strategy is to focus on purchasing items you'd normally buy — even outside of the sale event. For many, including myself, a reliable and comfortable pair of sneakers and easy-to-wear activewear are staples like no other. And for the better part of the past century, New Balance has earned its well-deserved reputation as being one of the top activewear brands for its unmatched ability to blend comfort, style, and durability.

This brand has earned recognition not only from Travel + Leisure editors, who have praised it as a leading shoe brand among those they've tested, but also from celebrities like Jennifer Aniston. The good news is that right now, just in time for the holidays, major retailers like Amazon, Zappos, and more are offering significant discounts on the beloved brand's footwear and apparel. And the even better news? We’ve gathered up a list of the best Cyber Monday New Balance deals, including the highly fashionable (and my personal go-tos) New Balance 550 Sneakers and the sporty New Balance Fresh Foam Roav Sneakers to help you get around better. What are you waiting for? Keep scrolling to find your new favorite tennis shoes or score big on gifts for everyone on your list.
