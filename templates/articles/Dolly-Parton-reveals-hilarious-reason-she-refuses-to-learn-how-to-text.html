                <textarea id="text" readonly> Dolly Parton is too busy with her "9 to 5" to answer a text message.

During an appearance on "The Drew Barrymore Show" Monday, the country music icon shared the reason she's sticking to her fax machine rather than learning how to text.

Parton, 77, said she's "a low-tech girl in a high-tech world," but it's by choice. "I don’t want to talk to everybody that wants to talk to me. I don’t text because I don’t want to have to answer."

The Rock & Roll Hall of Famer added that she'll pick up a phone call or return a call at a later time, but only if she wants to speak to that person. "Otherwise, I’ve got too much to think about than to clutter my mind up with everything else," she said.

Parton doubled down that her decision isn't because she is incapable of learning.

"I’m certainly not a stupid person. I could learn it if I wanted to, but I’d rather just have my fax machine (and) call in my creative stuff to my crew," she told Barrymore, 48. "And I’ve got the best crew in the world, and I surround myself with great people, but I just don’t have time to just sit with my face in the phone all day."

Parton's goddaughter Miley Cyrus previously revealed that she mainly communicates with the "Jolene" singer over fax.

"Every time I coordinate and kind of communicate with Dolly, it’s still through fax," Cyrus, 31, said on "Late Night with Seth Meyers" in May 2022.

The "Flowers" singer clarified that she still receives Parton's messages through her phone but her godmother "does a fax, and then someone scans the fax, and then they put it into a text message, and then that gets sent to me. And it’s always signed."

Cyrus added, "She has a phone, she just doesn't use it."

Parton recently collaborated with her goddaughter to record a duet of Cyrus' song "Wrecking Ball," which is featured on Parton's debut rock album "Rockstar."

Gushing about working with Cyrus, Parton told Barrymore, "She's so talented, so special."

The country music star said that while many people ask if she advises Cyrus on her career, the 31-year-old doesn't need it.

"Miley is Miley. She's going to know what to do," Parton said. "She knows who she is. She knows what she needs and she goes about it. She's willing to sacrifice for it and I always have been too."
