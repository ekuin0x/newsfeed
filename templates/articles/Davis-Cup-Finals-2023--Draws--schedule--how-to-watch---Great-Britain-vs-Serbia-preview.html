Can the Brits repeat the heroics of 2015? Here’s all you need to know about the Davis Cup Finals – including the draw, the British team and how you can watch at home.

Great Britain vs Serbia preview

Arguably the blockbuster match-up of the quarter-finals – Great Britain will face off against a Serbian team, led by 24-time Grand Slam champion and world No.1 Novak Djokovic.

The Brits come into the tie having gone unbeaten in the competition so far this season across four ties – including an unforgettable 2-1 win over France in the Group decider in Manchester.

Headed up by British No.1 Cam Norrie, who has had some close battles with Djokovic in the past and the in-form Jack Draper to call upon in the singles. Draper has been on a brilliant run of performances of late, lifting the title at the Bergamo Challenger, before making his first ATP final in Sofia.

While Dan Evans misses the event with injury, Captain Leon Smith will still have two top six doubles players to call upon should the tie come down to the wire. Wimbledon champion Neal Skupski and US Open champion Joe Salisbury bring a lot of experience to the team and know each other well, having previously won titles together in Vienna and San Diego.

Djokovic’s record speaks for himself, and the world No.1 was instrumental in Sebia beating the Brits in their meeting back in 2006. He’s publicly declared that the Davis Cup is his priority for the rest of the year as he looks to add to his title in 2010.

Serbia brings a strong squad to Malaga, with four players currently ranked inside the top 60. World No.33 Laslo Djere featured heavily in the singles during the Group Stages with two wins from three matches. Djokovic has recently played doubles with countryman Miomir Kecmanovic at the Rolex Paris Masters, which could give an insight into the Serbs plans.
