Cyber Monday gaming chair deal: Herman Miller Embody is $462 off

Herman Miller

If you're looking for a higher-end gaming chair option, we found another Cyber Monday deal worth considering. Be warned, it's an expensive chair, but its Cyber Monday discount is huge.

The luxurious Herman Miller x Logitech G Embody gaming chair is a die-cast aluminum chair offers features that budget-priced gaming chairs do not, including an additional layer of copper-infused foam on the seat that provides extra comfort while reducing heat buildup. The arm height and width are adjustable, as is the back -- you can set it to align perfectly with your spine for maximum support.

Regularly priced at $1,845, this luxury gaming chair has been reduced to $1,384 during the Herman Miller Cyber Monday sale.

Regularly priced at $3,485, it's reduced at the Herman Miller Cyber Monday sale to $2,614.
