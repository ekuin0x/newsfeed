                <textarea id="text" readonly> Omid Scobie has launched the publicity rounds for his new book about the royal family, Endgame, with provocative claims it is Prince William who has painted his younger brother Prince Harry as mentally fragile. Scobie, the author of Finding Freedom, which documented Harry and Meghan’s ‘Mexit’ from the UK to Hollywood, writes in his new book: “The side of it that a lot of people don’t know, or within our industry have known but chosen not to report, is just how involved William has been in many of the things that have gone out about his own brother.”

In an interview with The Times, he adds that William’s wife, the Princess of Wales, has always been favoured by the UK press. Scobie says, “In the coverage of Kate we infantilize her massively so the bar is always lower. The small achievements that we’ve seen from the Princess of Wales wouldn’t perhaps be noticed if it was from another member of the royal family, but with Kate it’s like ‘wow!’”

Scobie also makes the point that Andrew, Duke of York, remains in his royal residence in Windsor, despite his previous association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The journalist says: “It’s interesting what’s considered the final blow to see you ostracised from the family.”

More widely, in his book he writes that the royal family is at a pivotal moment: “The future of the royal family as we know it is in a crisis. That crisis being a lack of interest from young people, an apathy, a growing republican movement, questions over whether the family still uphold the morals and values of the crown that the Queen did such a great job of. But when you look at the cast of characters … it has been questionable.”

In his interview with The Times, he reflects: “It would take a lot to dismantle the British royal family. But could William be the last king as we know it? Absolutely.” He believes that the Windsors reduced to tourist attraction is a genuine danger, but that such a fate can be avoided if they kick into gear. “The book isn’t hammering the final nail in the coffin,” he says, smiling. “It’s just a reality check.”

For royal critics, fans and observers alike, as Scobie’s book makes its way to the shelves, it’s not going to be a quiet week. </textarea>
