                <textarea id="text" readonly> “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” stayed at No. 1 at the box office on Black Friday, retaining the top spot in its second week on the screens.

The dystopian action film took in $11.4 million on a relatively slow night at the movies, according to IMDB’s Box Office Mojo.

Ridley Scott’s “Napoleon” took second, with just $8.4 million in ticket sales on its opening weekend.

The Post called the $200 million biopic “ho-hum,” and said star Joaquin Phoenix depicted the strategic genius as “as a sourpuss clown who crazily rattles off nonsense.”

In third place was Disney’s fantasy film “Wish,” with an $8 million take.

“Trolls Band Together” dropped a notch to third place, with $7.1 million in sales.
