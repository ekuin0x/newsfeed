Welcome back to “Your Shopping Cart,” where we break out the top products that you, devoted Strategist readers, bought in droves. Think of this as the TL;DR of the Strategist. If your like-minded brethren are buying these items, maybe you’d like to as well.

The unofficial kickoff to holiday shopping — Black Friday and Cyber Monday — is ending soon, which means you’ve only got a few more hours to take advantage of some of the best sales of the year. We know wading through the hundreds of discounts can be overwhelming, so we rounded up the most popular Black Friday and Cyber Monday products that your fellow readers have been buying — all of which are still on sale.

Some of them are everyday items that are super-discounted right now, like a beauty-editor favorite snail mucin and an ecofriendly dry shampoo. Others are highly gift-worthy items, like the silk pillowcase readers have been buying in droves for months and a super-plush bathrobe. However, Cyber Monday ends tonight, so there’s no guarantee they’ll stay on sale or in stock much longer. That means if you see something you want — for yourself or for someone else — don’t wait to buy. If you want all of our favorite deals, check out our big hub of deals. (And to ensure you never miss a good sale again, sign up for our email newsletter.)

1. CosRx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence $14 $25 now 44% off $14 This CosRX snail mucin was a reader favorite on Prime Day, and it’s back on sale — for the cheapest we’ve seen it since January. If you need a refresher, this K-beauty staple can hydrate and retexturize dry and acne-prone skin, according to our beauty columnist Rio Viera-Newton, who has been recommending it since 2018. $14 at Amazon Buy

4. Brewish Jellyfish Lava Lamp $35 $45 now 22% off $35 Every year, our gift-obsessed team of writers and editors compiles a list of hundreds of unusual gifts for every type of giftee, and this year, this “trippy nightlight” from Brewfish was one of their suggestions for gifts under $50. You can change the almost-lifelike jellyfish between 16 different colors. $35 at Amazon Buy

5. Everlane The Dream Pant $53 $88 now 40% off $53 Everlane’s been pulling out all the stops on its sales recently, and these black work pants have become a quick favorite. These Dream Pants are our pick for the best pull-on work pants for women — but they’re comfortable enough to wear even if you have no desire to commute. Writer Ambar Pardilla tested them while working from home and said they felt more like “really well-made sweatpants.” $53 at Everlane Buy

8. Sunbeam Heating Pad $40 $65 now 38% off $40 It’s not the sexiest gift, but the right person will appreciate receiving this fleece heating pad. (One new mom told us that it’s one of the items she wished she’d put on her registry: “My neck got so sore that I developed ’mommy thumb.’ Because, apparently, the fascia is all connected.”) $40 at Amazon Buy
