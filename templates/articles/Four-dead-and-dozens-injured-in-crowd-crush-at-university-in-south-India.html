                <textarea id="text" readonly> At least four people were killed and dozens injured on Saturday evening in a crowd crush at a university in southern India, local officials and media reported.

The crush occurred at an outdoor auditorium in the Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) in south-west Kerala state, where a concert had been planned.

In a statement on X, formerly Twitter, the Kerala state governor, Arif Mohammad Khan, said he was “deeply shocked and grieved to know about the sad demise of four students” at CUSAT. “Heartfelt condolences to their families. Prayers for speedy recovery of injured,” he added.

The state health minister, Veena George, said in a statement that four people had been brought dead to the Kalamassery Medical College hospital while four more were in critical condition, the PTI news agency reported, adding that more than 60 people had been injured.

A local police official said that a crowd outside the auditorium had rushed to seek cover from a sudden downpour when a number of people slipped on some stairs and were subsequently trampled, according to PTI.

One of the deadliest crowd crushes in recent history occurred a decade ago in India, when at least 115 people were killed on the sidelines of a religious festival in central Madhya Pradesh state. </textarea>
