                <textarea id="text" readonly> Ranbir Kapoor is back and this time with a vengeance in the Sandeep Reddy Vanga-directed Animal. The makers opened its advance booking on Saturday morning and the response has been phenomenal. Within 8 hours of counters opening up for the audiences, Animal has sold over 20,000 tickets in the three national chains - PVR, Inox & Cinepolis.

This is the biggest response for a feature film in the post-pandemic world alongside the likes of Brahmastra and Tiger 3. The film is outselling the 2023 blockbuster, Gadar 2, in terms of pacing in advance booking. On the first day of tickets going live for sale, Brahmastra sold 30,000 tickets in national chains, and Tiger 3 sold 53,000 tickets. Animal is looking to sell around 45,000 tickets on the first day of sales.

Animal is among the most awaited feature films of 2023 and the initial response to advance booking just validates the pre-release hype of the film. It has also announced the arrival of a new superstar of Hindi Cinema - Ranbir Kapoor. He is joining the all-time greats of the modern era- Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan & Hrithik Roshan - by being consistent in delivering big openers and huge grossers.

The early trends of Animal in terms of advance booking indicate one of the biggest openings of all time in the history of Indian Cinema. And all of this is happening on a non-holiday.
