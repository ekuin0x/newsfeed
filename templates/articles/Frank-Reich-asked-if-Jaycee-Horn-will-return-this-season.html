                <textarea id="text" readonly> Will the Carolina Panthers ever get cornerback Jaycee Horn back this season? Well, Friday didn’t exactly provide the most encouraging of developments to that mystery.

Horn, who hasn’t played since injuring his hamstring in the regular-season opener, was listed as doubtful for the team’s Week 12 contest against the Tennessee Titans. After Friday’s practice, Joe Person of The Athletic asked head coach Frank Reich if Horn’s window will close without his return.

“I probably don’t wanna comment on that,” Reich replied. “I think he’s doin’ well. I don’t think that’s gonna happen, Joe. We gotta take it as it comes. But he’s been makin’ good progress, feel good about where he’s at. So we’ll continue to take it day by day, week by week.”

The 23-year-old, along with tight end Ian Thomas, was designated to return from injured reserve back on Nov. 13. Sunday, however, will likely mark the second consecutive game in which Horn will not be on the field.

If that is the case, the 2021 eighth overall pick will miss his 26th career game over 43 possible outings. And if the Panthers do not move Horn to the active roster within the next ten days, his season will officially be over. </textarea>
