New Partnership will Further Leverage SportsEngine’s Technology Platform to Improve Team Management, Communications, Payment Systems and Web Presence as Academy Continues Rapid Growth in U.S.

MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. (Oct. 25, 2023) – NBC Sports Next, the sports technology and innovation division of NBC Sports, today announced an exclusive technology partnership with BVB International Academy America, an affiliate of the German professional soccer club, Borussia Dortmund BVB, and one of the fastest-growing youth soccer academies in the U.S.

The multi-year agreement officially makes SportsEngine, NBC Sports Next’s leading team and club management technology platform, the exclusive provider of online member management, registration, payments, and digital content for BVB International Academy, which operates 17 academies across the U.S. for young soccer athletes up to 19 years of age. The partnership will boost and scale the digital presence of BVB International Academy, which provides its athletes with exposure to elite coaching methodologies and curriculums used by one of the most successful professional soccer clubs in Europe, as well as a world-class training environment, A-list competition, and outstanding player development.

United States men’s national soccer team captain Christian Pulisic and teammate Giovanni Reyna both have ties to Borussia Dortmund. Pulisic first played on Dortmund’s development squads in 2015 before quickly being promoted to the first team at the age of 17, while Reyna currently plays midfield for the club’s first team.

“We’re excited to start our new partnership with BVB International Academy and one of the biggest brands in worldwide soccer to help promote and grow the sport in the U.S.,” said Brett MacKinnon, SVP & General Manager, Youth & Recreational Sports, NBC Sports Next. “We share their commitment to serving an amazing community of youth soccer athletes and their families in the United States at the grassroots and elite national level.”

“We have partnered with SportsEngine for several years and it is one of those relationships that continues to build and get stronger all the time,” said Peter A. Brody, President and CEO, BVB International Academy North America. “As an organization, they are unafraid to learn from the past, as well as listen and innovate for what our club needs to be successful today. What really sets the people at SportsEngine apart from many other platform providers is their ability to focus on how they can add the greatest value and support for the future.”

The new NBC Sports Next partnership with BVB International Academy America denotes another important commitment that NBCUniversal has made to the sport of soccer. In March, SportsEngine and US Youth Soccer, the largest youth sports organization in the U.S., announced their extended partnership, which was highlighted by SportsEngine’s development of an online and mobile content network for USYS. Other efforts include making the Premier League more accessible in the U.S. through its airing on USA Network and Peacock; Telemundo’s extensive coverage of the World Cup; NBC Sports’ continued support of the Olympic and Paralympic movement, and more.
