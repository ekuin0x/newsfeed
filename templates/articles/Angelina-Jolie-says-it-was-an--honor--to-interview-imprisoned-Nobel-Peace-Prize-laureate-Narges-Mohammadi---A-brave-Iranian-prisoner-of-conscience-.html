                <textarea id="text" readonly> Angelina Jolie highlighted her interview with Narges Mohammadi for Time by sharing a post on her Instagram account on Thursday.

The 48-year-old actress shared a photo of the 51-year-old activist, and she also included a quote from the sit-down with the Nobel Peace Prize laureate.

The performer, whose adopted son Pax is currently embroiled in a feud with his father Brad Pitt, also penned a short message to express her excitement about being able to spread awareness about the Iranian national's work.

Jolie wrote: 'It was an honor to interview Narges Mohammadi, a brave Iranian prisoner of conscience. Please read her words to learn more of the courage and spirit of Iranian women and the moral power of peaceful resistance.'

Mohammadi is currently imprisoned in Tehran's Evin Prison, where she has been incarcerated since 2021.

Making it known: Angelina Jolie promoted her newly released interview with Narges Mohammadi for Time by sharing a post on her Instagram account on Thursday; she is seen in 2021

The Nobel Peace Prize laureate has been arrested twice before on various charges related to her work as an activist.

According to Time, the Iranian national has suffered from both mistreatment and beatings while in prison, and she recently embarked on a hunger strike.

The media outlet also reported that she has been barred from communicating with her children.

Jolie briefly touched on motherhood during her interview with Mohammadi, and stated that she would not be able to stand being unable to see her kids.

'I imagine myself in your situation—and hope that I would have half of your courage if I did—and cannot imagine how I would bear being separated from my children, and how much I would worry about them, probably more than I worried for myself,' she said.

The activist then spoke about being arrested in front of her children and was remarkably open about the effects of being kept away from her family.

'I think my detentions in front of my children, enduring solitary confinement, not seeing their faces and not hearing their voices, was unbearable beyond any word, logic or belief,' she said.

Jolie later brought up the topic of meeting women in refugee camps and spoke about their resilience in the face of adversity.

'I am amazed usually by their fearlessness and the way they manage to even laugh, and express themselves, and to not get crushed by their experiences,' she said.

Mohammadi responded by giving the actress a glimpse into the life of women incarcerated in Evin Prison.

'We gather to celebrate the birthdays of our fellow inmates, even the birthdays of their children. The sound of our singing and joy reaches the male wards, and male wardens complain about what happens in the women's ward,' she stated.

The Nobel Peace Prize laureate added: 'This is the sound of our vibrant life.' </textarea>
