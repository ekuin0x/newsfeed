                <textarea id="text" readonly> Trainers! Something exciting was just publicly reported by data miners on Reddit ‚Äì it seems that sprites for a dozen or more new Pok√©mon have been discovered, including some long-time fan favourites. This discovery includes some incredibly exciting Pok√©mon like Aegislash, Necrozma, Marshadow, Mega Mewtwo X and Y, all the missing Mega Pok√©mon, Origin forms for Dialga and Palkia, and even Hisuian starter final evolution forms.

We are sharing all of the discovery images below, but please, read our data mining report first:

üí° Disclaimer: You know the drill by now. Please read through all of this with a grain of salt ‚Äì we often post data mining reports that take months to release, and we don‚Äôt want our readers disappointed. Be smart, read this like speculation, and be happy once it goes live. None of this is endorsed by Niantic. It is based on publicly available information, and should be treated as speculation.

New Pok√©mon assets

Holiday and GO Fest 2024 costumes

Right of the bat, we can see that new Pikachu costumes, including GO Tour 2024 and Holiday 2023 variants have been discovered. This is not really surprising, as Niantic has already confirmed that GO Fest will return in 2024, and we always get a special Pikachu during winter Holidays. The addition of Santa Psyduck and Golduck is awesome tho!

Fishes and Swords

Wishiwashi Solo and School forms and both Aegislash forms were also spotted, alongside Lycanrock Dusk Form:

Necrozma and Marshadow

And now we come the the big ones. Necrozma and oh-my-god Marshadow! These two, Mudbray and Mudsdale, Drampa, Pyukumuku, Cetoddle, Cetitan were among the first ultra rare Pok√©mon to be found. There is an issue with shiny Necrozma, as it should be blue, not black.

Missing Mega Pok√©mon

But the list doesn‚Äôt stop there, as we assets for all missing Mega Pok√©mon were found! With this update, all of the Mega Pok√©mon assets are in the game, which means Niantic can release them at will, with no special preparation. Here are the Pok√©mon whose assets were discovered:

Mega Mewtwo Y

Mega Mewtwo X

Mega Metagross

Mega Sharpedo

Mega Mawile

Mega Audino

Mega Camerupt

Mega Lucario

Hello from the Hisui Region

And last, but definitely not least, we have assets for some of the most exciting Pok√©mon from the Hisui Region:

Dialga and Palkia Origin Forme

Wyrdeer

Hisuian Samurott, Decidueye, and Typhlosion

All of these Pok√©mon were originally discovered in the Hisui Region, which was introduced with the Pok√©mon Legends: Arceus game.

So exciting! There is no word on when these Pok√©mon will be released, but we do know that they are coming at some point in the future. Keep your excitement in check, and be wise about leaks and speculation. We‚Äôll update you with more info as it becomes available. </textarea>
