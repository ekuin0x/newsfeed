If you missed out on all the great toy deals during Black Friday, don’t despair. You can still shop for puzzles, stuffed animals, slime, Lego sets, bikes, and video games today, Cyber Monday. To help you make quick work of it, I waded through the thousands of on-sale products and pulled out the best ones available at the biggest discounts.

I am the Strategist’s toy writer with the lucky job of immersing myself in toy fairs, online parenting communities, and trend publications to stay on top of the hottest new toys each year and find out what the coolest parents, teachers, and kids are buying or adding to their wish lists. To help you make the most of Cyber Monday, I’ll be sniffing out the best toy deals, including Strat favorites like DIY jewelry-making kits, remote-control monster trucks, stylish play kitchens, dragon and princess dress-up costumes, and Bluey and Elmo merch. The list below is a curated sampling of expert-recommended, on-sale products we’ve written about before, most of which are at least 20 percent off or more. I’ve also included a bunch of deeply discounted toys from some of my favorite kid brands like Melissa & Doug, Magna-Tiles, Gund, Crayola, Mattel, and Disney.

To simplify your search, I’ve showcased my top picks at each online retailer, starting with the big three — Amazon, Target, and Walmart — followed by individual department stores, independent brands, and smaller shops in alphabetical order. For even more Cyber Monday discounts, be sure to check out our main Cyber Monday deals post. And to make sure you don’t miss anything (including kitchen, fashion, home, beauty, and tech deals), you can stay up-to-date by signing up for our newsletter.

I’ve finished updating this list, but everything below is still on sale and available so you can keep shopping through the end of the day. Just know that things may sell out, so if you see something you want, don’t wait.

Amazon Amazon’s Cyber Monday toy sales are sprawling with discounts on nearly every toy you can imagine. The upside is there are a ton of great options to consider, like over 50 percent off select Melissa & Doug puzzles, stuffed animals, and musical instruments and up to 50 percent off games and accessories for Nintendo Switch. The downside is it’s easy to miss the really good stuff among all the not-worth-your-time deals. Let me be your guide. Below is a grid of very good deals for kids of all ages.

Target Target’s toy aisle is known for being one of the best places to score deals on everything from LEGO sets to L.O.L. Surprise Dolls. This year, Target has been running a full week of Cyber Monday deals. You’ll find discounts up to 60 percent off on video games, consoles, and accessories. And there are also “buy one, get one 50 percent off” deals on select toy brands including Disney, Kinetic Sand, and Play-Doh.

Walmart Like Target, Walmart has a huge toy aisle with tons of LEGOs, action figures, Pokémon cards, and dollhouses. It also has very good Cyber Monday sales, and this year is no different, featuring more than 50 percent off on certain toys.

Avenlur Avenlur is your one-stop shop for wooden Montessori play gyms, swings, slides, and toddler towers. It is offering 20 percent off sitewide and 25 percent off purchases over $750.

Best Buy Though it’s not the first place I think about shopping for toys, Best Buy has some great deals on Legos, video games, and collectible toys like the below set of Disney-themed Hot Wheels cars made to celebrate the company’s 100th anniversary.

Claire’s For a lot of people (non-tweens mostly), Claire’s flies under the radar. But it stocks a deep inventory of trendy toys like Squishmallows, Pokémon cards, fidgets, and cute key chains. The retailer is offering an extra 25 percent off already discounted toys with code CM2023.

Crate & Kids If you want your playroom to look like it was styled for Instagram, Crate & Kids is one of the best places to shop. This Cyber Monday, it is slashing prices by up to 50 percent on baby play mats, pretend play toys, and playroom furniture.

Fat Brain Toys Fat Brain Toys is known for their outdoor and educational toys, and today only, customers can receive 15 percent off any order with code CYBER23. And starting tomorrow through December 1, customers will receive $20 off orders of $150 or more with code BQ-7243.

KiwiCo. KiwiCo, the STEAM-focused subscription brand for children 0 to 12 years old, is offering new subscriptions starting at just $15.95 a month for 3-, 6-, and 12-month plans. It is also taking 20 percent off all non-subscription purchases with the code GIFT. The same code will get you 25 percent off orders over $100 and 30 percent off orders over $150.

Kohl’s Don’t sleep on Kohl’s. The retailer has a wide selection of toys from Melissa & Doug, Fisher-Price, Hot Wheels, and Sesame Street. You’ll find deals up to 50 percent off with free shipping on purchases over $25.

Lalo Strategist staff parents, myself included, and Strategist readers with kids love Lalo’s high chair, play tent, and feeding sets. This fall, the brand launched its own toy boxes that can be purchased individually or as a monthly subscription. For Cyber Monday, you can get up to 40 percent off sitewide.

Lovevery We have heard from dozens of parents about how much they appreciate the convenience and value of Lovevery’s developmental play kits — and I’m a subscriber too. Until November 28, the brand is taking $30 off when you buy any three play kits with the code FUN30.

Maisonette Looking for whimsical (and nice-looking) pretend play sets, dress-up clothing, or durable outdoor toys? Maisonette has all of that and more — tit is also a great place to shop for dolls and stuffies — and it’s giving customers up to 70 percent off.

Merci Milo Merci Milo is the cool independent toy store (with international goods you can’t find anywhere else Stateside) that I would frequent if I lived in Los Angeles or Portland, Oregon. Luckily, they also have an extensive online inventory of dolls, miniature tools, Japanese bath toys, and lots of Montessori and Waldorf toys from brands like Grimm’s. Today, they’re offering 15 percent off sitewide, Maileg brand toys excluded.

Mudpuppy Mudpuppy is the brand behind our favorite mini-city puzzles, but it also makes beautifully designed board books, bath toys, arts and crafts, and games. This year it is hosting a weeklong sale with 30 percent off sitewide through Tuesday, November 28.

Ooly Artsy parents and actual art teachers love this brand’s markers, crayons, colored pencils, and sticker sets. Today, take 25 percent off everything.

Pottery Barn Kids Pottery Barn Kids is taking up to 60 percent off of toys, play furniture, holiday gifts, and more. Since the toys it sells tend to be on the expensive side, now’s a good time to save a big chunk of money on some heirloom-quality ones.

Sarah’s Silks Play silks come up in nearly every conversation I have with toy experts and child-development professionals. And they all say Sarah’s Silks are the best; they last forever and are made with the highest quality materials. But for something you aren’t sure your toddler will like, the prices can be high. This Cyber Monday, the brand is taking up to 70 percent off, making it easy to buy a few entry-level pieces or stock up on gifts for friends.

Super Smalls Through November 27, Super Smalls — a boutique brand for expensive-looking kiddie jewels — will be offering up to 30 percent off with code BFCM23 (This sale excludes the brand’s new Disney collaboration.)

Woom Woom bikes are a favorite of Strategist writer, and mom of two, Lauren Ro because of their sturdy frames and easy handling for even the littlest kids. The brand is offering up to 30 percent off bikes and 10 percent off gift cards.

Yoto New York writers and editors with kids are big fans of Yoto audio players. So much so that we have written about them almost as much as we have written about Magna-Tiles. The kid- and parent-approved brand will be discounting players, content, and accessories up to 20 percent through November 27.
