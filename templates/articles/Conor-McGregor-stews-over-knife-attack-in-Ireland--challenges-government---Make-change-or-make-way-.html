                <textarea id="text" readonly> Conor McGregor is not happy with the direction of his native Ireland and has hinted at a run for office or other action if the situation does not improve.

On Thursday, there were violent protests on the streets of Dublin after a knife attacker wounded three children — one seriously — and an adult.

A male suspect in his 50s was arrested; while his identity has not been disclosed, unconfirmed rumors spread online that he was an Algerian immigrant, which stoked tension among the protestors, according to the New York Times.

McGregor, the former UFC champion, wrote on X that he does not “condone” the riots in Dublin, but expressed dissatisfaction with the country’s leadership and effectively issued an open challenge to alter the direction.

“I do not condone last nights riots [sic]. I do not condone any attacks on our first responders in their line of duty. I do not condone looting and the damaging of shops. Last nights scenes achieved nothing toward fixing the issues we face,” McGregor wrote.

“I do understand frustrations however, and I do understand a move must be made to ensure the change we need is ushered in. And fast! I am in the process of arranging. Believe me I am way more tactical and I have backing. There will be change in Ireland, mark my words. The change needed. In the last month, innocent children stabbed leaving school. Ashling Murphy murdered. Two Sligo men decapitated. This is NOT Ireland’s future! If they do not act soon with their plan of action to ensure Ireland’s safety, I will.”

McGregor pushed back on Drew Garda, the Irish police commissioner, who blamed the protests in Dublin on a “hooligan faction driven by far right ideology”.

“Innocent children ruthlessly stabbed by a mentally deranged non-national in Dublin, Ireland today. Our chief of police had this to say on the riots in the aftermath. Drew, not good enough,” McGregor wrote.

“There is grave danger among us in Ireland that should never be here in the first place, and there has been zero action done to support the public in any way, shape or form with this frightening fact. NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Make change or make way.”

Ireland’s prime minister Leo Varadkar took a harsh tone regarding the protestors.

“These criminals did not do what they did because they love Ireland, they did not do what they did because they wanted to protect Irish people, they did not do it out of any sense of patriotism, however warped,” Varadkar told reporters on Friday, as covered by the AP.

“They did so because they’re filled with hate, they love violence, they love chaos and they love causing pain to others.”

Reporting from Dublin earlier this week, The Post noted that 141,600 immigrants made their way to Ireland in the 12 months leading up to this past April, the most in a year since the late 1990’s and that people not born in Ireland “comprise a whopping 20% of the population.”

Friday, McGregor continued to rail on the current environment in the country.

“Despicable scenes last night in Dublin City centre. People looting shops amidst the anger and rage Ireland has for the many failed policies of government. Has this regime ever had even one successful policy?” the fighter asked.

“Health service in shambles. Abominable housing crisis. Immigration wide open. Climate hypocrisy rubbed in our face. Danger on our streets at an all time high. Can we point to any successes? We can lambaste these wasters looting and damaging our streets last night, and we will. But when it passes, the spotlight shines again firmly on the many (all) failed policies of this Irish government.

“We are awaiting action. The families of those grieving are waiting. We will not forget. You will not brush this under the rug. We stand with those in mourning. Make change or make way.”

McGregor also praised Warren Donohoe, the heroic Irishman who thwarted the knife attack, and pledged that the man could enjoy himself “On the house in my establishment for life.” </textarea>
