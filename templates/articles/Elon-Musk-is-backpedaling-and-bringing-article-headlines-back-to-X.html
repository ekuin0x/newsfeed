Elon Musk says X is going to display article headlines for links posted on the platform again.

The about-turn comes less than two months after X stopped displaying article headlines in October.

Musk previously said dropping the headlines would make the site look more aesthetically pleasing.

Elon Musk says X is going to start displaying article headlines for links posted on the platform again.

"In an upcoming release, ùïè will overlay title in the upper portion of the image of a URL card," the billionaire said in an X post on Wednesday.

The announcement comes just less than two months after X stopped displaying article headlines in October.

Musk floated making a change to X to axe all article headlines back in August, saying that it would greatly improve the site's aesthetics.

This is coming from me directly. Will greatly improve the esthetics. ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 22, 2023

When an X user teased Musk for reversing his own decision, Musk said that the article headlines would be displayed differently this time.

"No, the title will be in the image overlaid at the top, with URL overlaid at the bottom, as it is now ‚Äì no extra vertical pixels used." Musk wrote on Thursday, adding that he detested "those giant, ugly URL cards" from the platform's previous design.

Musk has introduced multiple changes since he acquired the platform in October 2022.

In April, Musk dropped the platform's legacy verification program ‚Äî the blue ticks that verified the authenticity of famous personalities. In its place, he rolled out the Twitter Blue subscription program.

Then in September, Musk said the platform may introduce a paywall to all its users because he said it was the only method he could think of to "combat vast armies of bots."

Representatives for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.
