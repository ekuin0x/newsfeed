Inside the Series: Samford

By the Numbers

said it best following Auburn's hard-fought 14-10 win at Cal over the weekend. "In the midst of chaos, there's opportunity."The game didn't go as expected for the Tigers. Head coachthought they would go into Cal and score 30 or 40 points and make it a little easier on the defense. That didn't happen. Instead, it was up to the defense to step up. And they did, time and time again."I really think it was a good thing for our defense to be in situations where we're challenged," Asante said the following Monday. "We can say that we want to be a really good defense, but we have to be in situations where our back is against the wall and you have to put out the fire. Those types of things really do uplift players. It's a morale thing. It builds that confidence."The offense struggled for most of the game Saturday, but they came up with a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter and made the plays when they had to.Ultimately, nobody quit. Faced with adversity for the first time this season, Auburn rose to the occasion and found a way. As a result, the Tigers are 2-0."I think there is so much to build on," Freeze said. "I am still learning this team, and they are still learning me. I was so pleased. There was no panic. It was just, 'We are going to figure this out somehow, some way, and come out of here with a win.' Not every team in year one I've had could handle that, and I was not sure about our kids, truthfully."I don't think anyone quit believing that we could win the game, and it showed in the way they played. I'm really proud of that growth that we can use to build on."After a strenuous road trip like Auburn had to Cal, the coaches and players could not be more excited to return home this Saturday and play in Jordan-Hare Stadium again. There will be another sellout crowd on hand as the Tigers welcome in Samford.Auburn and Samford will kick off at 6 p.m. CT from Jordan-Hare Stadium. The game will be televised on ESPN+ and SEC Network+ with Clay Matvick and Aaron Murray on the call. You can also listen to Andy Burcham, Jason Campbell, Ronnie Brown and Will Herring who will have the radio call on 94.3 FM, online at AuburnTigers.com and on the Auburn app.This week, fans attending the game are asked toI feel like it showed us who we are. Not offensively, but defensively. We know that we can trust our defense. We told them right after the game, "We got y'all and we appreciate y'all so much." Without our defense, we definitely don't win that game. They bailed us out, and I'm just happy to have those guys in my corner because I know how hard they work.It's amazing to be back. I've been ready to get back to this place. There's nothing like home. We've got the best fans in the country, and I feel like it's going to be hard to beat us in this stadium this year.It was amazing. For it to be Coach Freeze's first touchdown as an Auburn Tiger as the head coach and just being my first career touchdown. It was good. Just seeing the crowd roar right when I entered the end zone. It just felt good scoring in Jordan-Hare. I've got a lot more coming this year for sure.Auburn leads the all-time series against Samford 28-0-1. Of the 28 victories, 19 have been shutouts, including each of the first seven games. The two teams met 20 times from 1903-33. This will be just the fifth matchup since 1945 with all five coming since 1992.The Tigers lead the series 14-0 in Auburn, 8-0-1 in Birmingham and 6-0 in Montgomery. Saturday will be the sixth straight game in the series played in Auburn. The last time the two teams met anywhere other than Auburn was a 38-0 Tiger win in Montgomery in 1945 â€“ the fourth meeting in the state capital in six seasons.Auburn is 74-1-1 all-time against current members of the Southern Conference with 37 shutouts in games against Chattanooga, The Citadel, East Tennessee State, Furman, Mercer, Samford, Western Carolina and Wofford. The Tigers have won 36 straight games against SoCon members since a 19-14 loss to Wofford in 1950. The only other game against a Southern Conference opponent Auburn didn't win was a 9-9 tie against Samford in 1927.Auburn holds an all-time record of 98-54-2 against teams from the state of Alabama.With touchdown catches in the first two contests of 2023, sophomore wide receiver(No. 5) is the first Auburn player with touchdown receptions in back-to-back games since Kobe Hudson did it against Alabama and Houston in 2021.The 10 points allowed by the Auburn defense at California were tied for the fewest points the Tigers have allowed against a Power 5 opponent since defeating Arkansas 34-3 in 2018. They allowed 10 points vs. Texas A&M in 2022 and at Arkansas in 2019.Through the first two games, opponents have reached the red zone six times against Auburn, and the Tigers have allowed just two scores. With a .333 percentage, Auburn leads the SEC in red zone defense and is second nationally behind Syracuse. The Tigers also lead the SEC in third-down conversion percentage defense (.185).With last year's overtime win against Missouri, Auburn has won 31 straight Homecoming games. The Tigers have an 84-8-4 Homecoming record since the first game in 1924. </textarea>
