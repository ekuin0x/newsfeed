                <textarea id="text" readonly> Arsenal kickoff a key run of matches on their return to action with a short Premier League trip to neighbours Brentford on November 25.

Mikel Arteta's side are back on the domestic trail following the international break and they face 10 games across all competitions before the end of 2023.

The Gunners need just one more win to confirm their Champions League Round of 16 spot in 2024 as the Premier League becomes their sole focus in December.

Arteta could look to strengthen his squad in the January transfer window, with injuries becoming a growing concern for the Spanish coach, and a clash with the Bess will be a test of his squad depth.

Brentford vs Arsenal lineups

Arteta will assess the fitness of several key players on their return from international duty but the visitors will be relieved not to be adding extra travel to their schedule with Brentford one of their closest rivals.

He will be without first choice goalkeeper David Raya with the Spanish stopper ineligible to face his parent club this season as per their loan deal. Captain Martin Odegaard is set to start after recovering from a facial injury.

Thomas Frank's squad has also been impacted negatively by the international window and the hosts will be forced into a reshuffle in this derby clash.

Nathan Collins joined the Brentford injury list during the international break and Frank is short of numbers in defence ahead of this game.

Below are the projected starting lineups for both teams ahead of their Premier League match at the Gtech Community Stadium on November 25.

Brentford starting 11

(4-3-3): Flekken (GK) — Ajer, Pinnock, Mee, Roerslev — Jensen, Norgaard, Janelt — Mbeumo, Wissa, Lewis-Potter.

Injured: Henry, Hickey, Schade, Collins, Damsgaard, Dasilva

Henry, Hickey, Schade, Collins, Damsgaard, Dasilva Suspended: Toney

Collins' absence means Frank could revert back to a four-man defence with Mads Roerslev starting at left-back. Keane Lewis-Potter's return is a positive in attack and the former Hull City winger will be important to Brentford on the counter-attack.

Arsenal starting 11

(4-3-3): Ramsdale (GK) — Tomiyasu, Saliba, Gabriel, Zinchenko — Odegaard, Jorginho, Rice— Saka, Jesus, Martinelli.

Injured: Partey, Soares, Smith-Rowe, Timber, White (doubtful)

Partey, Soares, Smith-Rowe, Timber, White (doubtful) Suspended: Vieira

Arteta has to balance his squad carefully ahead of a busy period, and he is unlikely to risk Ben White as he recovers from a muscle injury. Aaron Ramsdale will cover for Raya in goal, in his first Premier League appearance since September 3.

Brazilian duo Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus will be assessed following their arrival back from international duty with Arteta not indicating any injury issues for either player.
