                <textarea id="text" readonly> Online shoppers who took advantage of Black Friday spent enough with retailers to set a new record this year, according to Adobe Analytics.

The company said online Black Friday shopping sales came in at $9.8 billion.

It climbed 7.5% from the total that Black Friday online shoppers forked over in 2022, according to Adobe Analytics. Last year, consumers spent $9.2 billion online on the day after Thanksgiving.

"The decline in online prices over the last year has created a favorable environment for consumers with strong discounts this season that are tempting to even the most price conscious consumers," Adobe Digital Insights lead analyst Vivek Pandya said in a statement.

Purchases of electronics in particular contributed to this year’s Black Friday online sales, climbing 152% from their daily averages in October, according to the company. Many consumers picked up smartwatches, TVs and audio equipment.

Here’s how much online spending has occurred on other days of Cyber Week so far, according to Adobe Analytics:

Thursday (Thanksgiving): $5.6 billion.

Saturday: $5 billion.

Sunday: $5.3 billion.

On Cyber Monday, online consumers are projected to choose the method for $782 million worth of shopping, the company said.
