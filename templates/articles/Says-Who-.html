                <textarea id="text" readonly> SATURDAY PUZZLE — This is a gorgeous grid from Jeff Stillman, who has constructed Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday puzzles for The Times but never a weekend or themeless crossword. Four lively span entries make a frame for the rest of the fill, which also somehow winds around the center of the puzzle.

I had a much harder time with the shorter entries than with the span entries today, mostly because of unusual clues in the fill.

Tricky Clues

17A. This “Extra-wide shoe spec” got me with its four letters. I’m familiar with EEE shoes, of course, but EEEE? Sure, and no offense to anyone out there walking on EEEE or wider feet.

24A/32A. Both of these entries involve emojis. It took me a minute to get 24A, “Thumbs-up response,” which is not “OK” but a LIKE. You would think that would have tuned my eye for 32A, “Something often containing a single parenthesis,” but I was convinced that this entry would be from the mathematical realm until I figured out SMILEY using a lot of crossing letters. You don’t see “:-)” that often anymore since emojis have gotten so nuanced and numerous, but I still trot it out sometimes. </textarea>
