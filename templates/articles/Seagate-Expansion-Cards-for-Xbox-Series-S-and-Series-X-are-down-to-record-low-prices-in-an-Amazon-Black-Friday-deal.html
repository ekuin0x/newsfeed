If you play a ton of games, most consoles available today have a laughable about of onboard storage to hold them all. If you've already picked up a few more games today thanks to Black Friday deals, you may want to consider getting some more digital storage to support them. Xbox users can pick up Seagate's Storage Expansion Cards for Xbox Series X and Series S for new all-time low prices. Seagate's 1TB model is currently $130, which is a 41 percent discount from its original $220 price. If 1TB just won't cut it, the 2TB version is 18 percent off, dropping to $230 from $280. If Seagate isn't your brand of choice, Western Digital's 1TB C50 Storage Expansion Card for Xbox is down to $125 from $150 — a 17 percent discount.

In a perfect world, our gaming consoles would have endless gigabytes of storage for games (while we're wishing for things, they'd also be cheaper). Yet, the 1TB Seagate and Western Digital storage expansion cards double the amount of storage that comes with the Xbox Series X — even more so since some of the initial storage is for the operating system.

The Seagate and Western Digital expansion cards work relatively the same. One of the most significant factors is that Seagate's card connects with a USB while Western Digital's card goes right into Xbox's expansion slot. Typically, Western Digital is a better deal at $70 cheaper, but with only a $5 difference, it comes down to preference. However, only Seagate offers the 2TB option, so the choice is easy if that's what you want. Don't take too long to decide, as lots of gameplay awaits.
