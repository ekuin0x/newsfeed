                <textarea id="text" readonly> US Cyber Monday deals you can still get: iPhone 15 Pro Max, Galaxy Z Fold5, Galaxy S23 FE

Black Friday was last week and it was a hectic time of lightning deals and constant fear of missing out. You're practically losing money if you don't get what you don't need on a discount. Thank goodness that's over. Oh wait, we have some ongoing Cyber Monday deals lined up for you lovely people!

In a rare occurrence, there are some current iPhones on discount. You can get $100 off at checkout on Amazon when you pair it with a gift or security card (conditions apply).

You can snag a certified refurbished Google Pixel 7 Pro for as low as $410. That's not a bad deal for yesteryear's flagship Pixel. If you want the current-gen models, you can get $125 off the Pixel 8 and a whole $200 off the Pixel 8 Pro on Amazon.

Motorola has kept its discounts since Black Friday. The Moto G Stylus 5G 2023 is just $250 on BestBuy - $150 off. You can snag a Motorola edge 2023 for $350 on BestBuy. Going up to $600 nets you a 512GB edge+ with 512GB of storage. The Motorola razr 2023 realizes the $500 foldable dream thanks to a $200 discount. The Think Phone is down by $170 on Amazon, while the premium Motorola razr+ is a whopping $300 off at just $700 for a 256GB model.

OnePlus isn't big on Black Friday offers - the Open is regularly-priced on both Amazon and BestBuy. The OnePlus 11 is a deal on BestBuy, however, where you can get the 256GB for just $550 - 80$ less than on Amazon.

Samsung's phones are great deals for Cyber Monday. The Galaxy S23 Ultra is discounted by $300 for both the base 256GB model and the 512GB one. The Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S23+ are also discounted, but the Galaxy S23 FE is the best deal at just $400. The Galaxy Z Fold5 is discounted by $500 bucks for both the 256GB and 512GB models. And if you're fine with last year's foldable, a certified refurbished 512GB Galaxy Z Fold4 is just $700.

Finally, the Sony Xperia 1 V isn't the most competitively priced, especially considering it's a 256GB model, but loyal Sony fans may want to take a look at this deal.
