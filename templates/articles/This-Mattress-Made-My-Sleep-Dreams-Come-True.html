                <textarea id="text" readonly> I didn’t buy my first brand-new mattress until I was in my mid-30s.

Until then, I’d slept on used or super-cheap mattresses, as one does when they are saddled with student debt.

But my husband and I eventually decided it was time to grow up. Our backs simply could no longer bear the springs from a 20-year-old mattress whose origin we couldn’t identify.

Making that decision was the easy part. We still had the challenge of finding a new mattress we’d both love.

He raved about the Tempur-Pedic guest bed at my aunt’s house. I thought it was too hard.

I gushed about the bed at a swanky hotel we splurged on. He thought it was too soft.

And so I turned to Wirecutter.

This was long before I worked here. And the sleep experts (whom I now know personally and trust even more as the very best in the biz) extolled Saatva, a brand I hadn’t even heard of.

As they explained the difference between innerspring and foam, used terms like “cushy” and “Euro top,” and emphasized firmness, I found myself checking off every make-believe box in my head.

Without even trying it out, I hit the purchase button for a Saatva Classic, our pick from the guide to the best innerspring mattress. And what a great decision that turned out to be. </textarea>
