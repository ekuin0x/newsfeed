                <textarea id="text" readonly> Update — July 11th, 11:40AM EDT: Stuttgart wants Nübel on loan

If you felt like VfB Stuttgart would be a good destination for Bayern Munich goalkeeper Alexander Nübel, this might be disappointing.

German outlet kicker is reporting that VfB Stuttgart only wants Nübel on a loan assignment, while Bayern Munich wants to sell him outright:

Above all, the fact that FC Bayern, to which Nübel is tied until 2025, is only interested in a sale makes things complicated. There is talk of a transfer fee of around eight million euros for the keeper who was last loaned to AS Monaco. For VfB, on the other hand, only a loan deal is possible from a financial and sporting point of view. It is also one year old to make the necessary transition from junior to adult easier for Dennis Seimen. The 17-year-old is not just “a huge talent” in the eyes of coach (Sebastian) Hoeneß, who Stuttgart want to see in the Bundesliga in a year or two - in a VfB shirt. Putting an ambitious 26-year-old in front of him is neither the point nor was it previously intended.

Whoever the anonymous mystery team referenced in the original post is, might now be in the driver’s seat for this pursuit.

Original Post

One of the worst kept secrets in this summer transfer window has been the inevitable exit of goalkeeper Alexander Nübel from Bayern Munich.

Upon returning from his loan at AS Monaco, Nübel has been expected to try and find a way out of Säbener Straße as soon as possible.

Now, it appears that the 26-year-old will get his wish.

According to a report from Sport Bild journalist Tobi Altschäffl (as captured by @iMiaSanMia), Nübel will not be with the team on Thursday:

Bayern have given Alexander Nübel permission not to be present at Thursday’s performance tests ahead of a move away from the club. Two clubs are currently in the race: Stuttgart and an unnamed foreign club. Stuttgart are looking for a new goalkeeper and Alexander Nübel is at the top of their list. Nübel wants to join Stuttgart if he is to stay in the Bundesliga as he estimates he would be a starter there. Another foreign club is in the race. Decision in the next couple of days. Bayern only want to sell Nübel. A loan is not an option. An agreement could be reached for an amount slightly less than Nübel’s market value (€8m). Bayern want a buy-back clause to be included in the deal.

VfB Stuttgart would certainly be an interesting landing place for Nübel, but the curiosity really lies with who the foreign team is that is involved in this pursuit?

Hmmm...

Can’t get enough transfer talk? Then why not check out our podcast? This week we have an in-depth discussion about Harry Kane including the financials of the deal, what Daniel Levy might accept, who Bayern Munich could sell to fund the move, the impending crisis at goalkeeper amid reports of Neuer’s delayed recovery, and more!
