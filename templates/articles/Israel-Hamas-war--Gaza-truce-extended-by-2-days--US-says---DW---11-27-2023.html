                <textarea id="text" readonly> German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier described his current visit to Israel as "difficult, but necessary." One Kibbutz Be'eri resident explained how grateful she is for Germany's solidarity following the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas.

DW's Rosalia Romaniec spoke with Sofie Berzon MacKie, the director of the now-destroyed Be'eri Art Gallery, in the kibbutz.

MacKie called Steinmeier's visit to the Kibbutz "a vote of confidence in our ability to rebuild our lives and giving us something to dream of and to look forward to."

Asked whether the Be'eri community will return and rebuild, she told DW: "If the security situation is resolved in a way that we can live peacefully here, then the majority of the community would love — and even cannot wait — to come home and clean this up and continue living our lives."

MacKie highlighted the importance of rebuilding the Be'eri Art Gallery: "I think art and culture are really one of the most important arenas that humanity has to develop [and] understand and have dialogue about its story in a non-violent, in an elegant, in a diverse way."

She also said that it was important that the violence of October 7 doesn't result in people losing their humanity.

"I think that if we lose faith in humanity because an extreme violent group did this horrifying thing, then it would be a great loss," she told DW. "If... I am consumed now by hate and revenge and I lost all compassion for anyone who is not us, we have lost something that I am not willing to lose." </textarea>
