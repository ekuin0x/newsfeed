Cricket PAK vs AFG: With eyes on Asia Cup and World Cup, Afghanistan name solid 18-member squad for Pakistan ODIs By Utkarsh Singh Published: Sunday, August 6, 2023, 17:06 [IST]

PAK vs AFG: Afghanistan Cricket Board’s (ACB) on Sunday named an 18-member squad for the three-match ODI series against Pakistan which will be played from August 22 to 26 in Sri Lanka.

18-year-old left-arm spinner Noor Ahmad has been recalled to Afghanistan's ODI squad as the Hashmatullah Shahidi-led side look to finalise their combination ahead of the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup in India later this year and the upcoming Asia Cup 2023 from August 30.

The return of Noor, who plays alongside Rashid Khan for Gujarat Titans (GT), means that left-arm spinner Zia Ur Rahman Akbar, who recently made his ODI debut against Bangladesh and uncapped leg-spinner Izharulhaq Naveed, who was part of the Test squad, were left out.

The Fast Bowling duo of Mohammad Saleem Safi and Wafadar Momand, who were part of Afghanistan’s recent ODI tour to Bangladesh, have retained their spots.

"Our whole concentration is to prepare the team for the upcoming two big events of Asia Cup and the World Cup 2023," ACB Chief Selector Asadullah Khan said.

"This three-match ODI series against Pakistan provides us with a wonderful opportunity to prepare the team for the forthcoming two events."

"The preparations for the Pakistan series are progressing well. The players have recently performed well in the Kabul Camp, which has been supervised by ACB's HPC staff. The team will also undergo a week-long conditioning camp prior to the Pakistan series," he added.

Afghanistan ODI squad vs Pakistan: Hashmatullah Shahidi (C), Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Ikram Alikhil, Ibrahim Zadran, Riaz Hassan, Rahmat Shah, Najibullah Zadran, Mohammad Nabi, Azmatullah Omarzai, Rashid Khan, Noor Ahmad, Mujeeb Ur Rehman, Fazal Haq Farooqi, Abdul Rahman, Mohammad Saleem Safi and Wafadar Momand.

Reserves: Farid Ahmad Malik and Shahidullah Kamal.
