                <textarea id="text" readonly> The U.S. FDA has granted five years' market exclusivity for Talicia under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation, as recommended by the FDA Exclusivity Board

This grant is on top of three years' exclusivity granted for the approval of Talicia under section 505(b)(2). Talicia is protected by its broad intellectual property suite to 2034

Talicia is the leading branded first-line therapy prescribed by U.S. gastroenterologists1 for eradication of H. pylori - a bacterial infection that affects approximately 35% of the U.S. adult population2

RALEIGH, N.C. and TEL-AVIV, Israel, Nov. 27, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- RedHill Biopharma Ltd. (NASDAQ: RDHL) ("RedHill" or the "Company"), a specialty biopharmaceutical company, announced that the U.S. FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has granted five years' market exclusivity for Talicia3 under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation, as recommended by the FDA Exclusivity Board. This grant is on top of three years' exclusivity granted for the approval of Talicia under section 505(b)(2). Talicia is protected by its broad intellectual property suite to 2034.

"Talicia is the only FDA-approved rifabutin-based therapy for the eradication of H. pylori. Its components and formulation are optimized to provide patients with the necessary medications for successful H. pylori eradication, an innovation rewarded by this market exclusivity and other IP, providing protection to 2034," said Patricia Anderson, RedHill's Senior Vice President of Regulatory Affairs. "With significant concerns around maintaining effective therapeutic options for infectious diseases in the face of growing microbial resistance, it is vital that the most effective options are utilized first line. Talicia's favorable efficacy, tolerability, and resistance profile, in the only all-in-one formulation available, provides potential advantages over clarithromycin-based regimens for most patients."

The FDA recently approved a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for Talicia, allowing a change to a more flexible three times daily (TID), taken at least 4 hours apart with food, dosing regimen for H. pylori eradication enabling patients to follow a convenient "breakfast, lunch and dinner" dosing routine, which may support increased patient adherence and optimize the potential for successful H. pylori eradication.

About H. pylori infection

H. pylori is a bacterial infection that affects approximately 35% of the U.S. population, with an estimated two million patients treated annually4. Worldwide, more than 50% of the population has H. pylori infection, which is classified by the WHO as a Group 1 carcinogen. It remains the strongest known risk factor for gastric cancer5 and a major risk factor for peptic ulcer disease6 and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma7. More than 27,000 Americans are diagnosed with gastric cancer annually8. Eradication of H. pylori is becoming increasingly difficult, with current therapies failing in approximately 25-40% of patients who remain H. pylori-positive due to high resistance of H. pylori to antibiotics – especially clarithromycin – which is still commonly used in standard combination therapies2.

About Talicia

Talicia is a novel, fixed-dose, all-in-one oral capsule combination of two antibiotics (amoxicillin and rifabutin) and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (omeprazole), approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of H. pylori infection in adults.

Talicia is the only low-dose rifabutin-based therapy approved for the treatment of H. pylori infection and is designed to address H. pylori's high resistance to other antibiotics. The high rates of H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin have led to significant rates of treatment failure with clarithromycin-based therapies and are a strong public health concern, as highlighted by the ACG, FDA and the World Health Organization (WHO) in recent years.

In the pivotal Phase 3 study, Talicia demonstrated 84% eradication of H. pylori infection in the intent-to-treat (ITT) group vs. 58% in the active comparator arm (p<0.0001). Minimal to zero resistance to rifabutin, a key component of Talicia, was detected in RedHill's pivotal Phase 3 study. Further, in an analysis of data from this study, it was observed that subjects who were confirmed adherent9 to their therapy had response rates of 90.3% in the Talicia arm vs. 64.7% in the active comparator arm10. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Talicia and other antibacterial drugs, Talicia should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.



Talicia is eligible for a total of eight years of U.S. market exclusivity under its Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation and is also covered by U.S. patents which extend patent protection until 2034 with additional patents and applications pending and granted in various territories worldwide.
