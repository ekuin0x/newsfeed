                <textarea id="text" readonly> New Zealand all-rounder Rachin Ravindra is proud of performing well in India as he continued his fine run of form in the World Cup 2023. Ravindra scored his second hundred of the tournament against Australia on October 28.

"I guess I'm 100% Kiwi and I'm very proud of my Indian heritage. But I guess it's proud to be able to do it in the country where my parents were born and where they grew up and where a lot of my family is. But I think, obviously the conditions, it's good for batting and being able to come to India previously on tours and trying to not perfect my game but I try get better. I guess that that helps in a way," said Ravindra. </textarea>
