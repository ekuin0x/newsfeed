                <textarea id="text" readonly> The Gotham Awards were tonight, which means that the Joker took his yearly one-night sabbatical to allow awards season to officially begin. The Gotham Awards ceremony is among the first shows of the entertainment awards marathon we’ll be running for the next few months. Nominees tend to fall on the indie side of things, giving them a chance to reap some awards-night glory before Oppenheimer, Barbie, and Killers Of The Flower Moon steamroll the road to the Oscars.

Unsurprisingly, A24 productions led nominations this year, with 10 nods across television and film. Coming off the Oscar-winning success of Everything Everywhere All At Once, A24 nabbed nominations for Past Lives, The Zone Of Interest, and Beef. Not to be outdone, with four nominations, Searchlight Pictures’ All Of Us Strangers had the most nominations of any singular work. Sadly, it left empty-handed.

Perhaps surprisingly, Netflix was the big winner of the evening, bringing home awards for May December and Beef. However, indie cinemas’ two buzziest studios, A24 and NEON, both won big, with Past Lives and Anatomy Of A Fall taking home the night’s biggest awards.
