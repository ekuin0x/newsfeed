Unluckiest cricketer?

NEW DELHI: Indian wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson opened up about being left out of the ODI World Cup 2023 squad and shared insights into a conversation he had with Team India skipper Rohit Sharma in a recent interview on the YouTube channel 'I AM with Dhanya Varma'.Samson revealed that Rohit was among the first to reach out to him, acknowledging his performance in the Indian Premier League ( IPL )."Rohit Sharma was the first or second person who came to me and talked. He told me, 'Hey Sanju, wassup. You performed well in the IPL but hit too many sixes against the Mumbai Indians . You bat really well.' I had great support from him," Samson said.Despite the disappointment of not making it to the World Cup squad, the 29-year-old from Kerala expressed gratitude for the encouragement he received.Addressing perceptions that label him as the "unluckiest cricketer," Samson shared a positive outlook on his career, stating, "People call me the unluckiest cricketer, but where I've reached currently, it's much more than what I thought I could."Samson, who made his international debut in 2015 in the T20 format, has played 24 matches, amassing 374 runs. In the ODI format, he boasts 390 runs in 12 innings with an impressive average of 55.71. While his international record might not be as eye-catching, his IPL performances have been stellar, with 152 matches and 3888 runs to his name.The right-handed batter's last international appearance was in the second T20I against Ireland on August 20, where he played a notable 40-run knock from 26 balls. As Samson continues to carve his path in the world of cricket, fans eagerly await to see how his career unfolds and if more opportunities on the international stage are in store for the talented wicketkeeper-batter. </textarea>
