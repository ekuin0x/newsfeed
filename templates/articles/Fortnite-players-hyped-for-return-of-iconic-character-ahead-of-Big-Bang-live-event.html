                <textarea id="text" readonly> Fortnite players are now hyped for the return of an iconic character in the upcoming Big Bang live event that concludes the ongoing Chapter 4. While several leaks have hinted at such a possible return, here’s what fans of the character had to say about the same.

Agent Jones, or Jonesy as he is known to many, will reportedly return for The Big Bang, as revealed by well-known data miner Egyptian Fortnite Leaker. A new skin, which will be released either before or after the live event, was seen in the leak, along with many encrypted files containing the skin’s contents.

When the skin finally hits the Item Shop, it’ll be available in two different selectable styles for players to choose from. Since the character vanished before Chapter 3 began, the data miner claims he will make a return in both the live event and the core Fortnite storyline.
