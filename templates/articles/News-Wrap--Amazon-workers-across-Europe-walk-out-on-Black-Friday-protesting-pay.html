                <textarea id="text" readonly> Nick Schifrin:

Organizers said the Amazon strikes are planned to last through Cyber Monday.

Meanwhile, in Washington state, more than 400 Macy's employees walked off the job today at selected stores over safety concerns and pay demands. They're expected to return to work before Monday.

In the Russian-Ukraine war, fighting escalated in key areas as both sides try to make gains before the worst of winter sets in. Russian forces in occupied Crimea claim they shot down dozens of Ukrainian drones overnight. And Ukraine's military said it blunted heavy new assaults on Avdiivka, north of Donetsk. Russians have been trying to capture it for two months.

A tense calm has returned today in Dublin, Ireland, after anti-immigrant rioting. It began Thursday when three children were stabbed outside of school. Police arrested a suspect, who is still unidentified, but rumors spread he was a foreigner. With that, far right protesters stormed the streets, burning buses, battling police and looting stores.

Officers arrested 34 people. And, today, the prime minister condemned the violence. </textarea>
