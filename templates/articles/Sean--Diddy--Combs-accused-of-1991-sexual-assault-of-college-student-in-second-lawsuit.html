                <textarea id="text" readonly> Sean "Diddy" Combs is in legal trouble once again, facing a second lawsuit that accuses the music mogul of drugging and raping a then-college student in 1991.

The woman, Joi Dickerson-Neal, filed her complaint Thursday in Manhattan Supreme Court, a day before the New York State Adult Survivors Act expiration date, and alleges she was drugged, sexually assaulted and abused, and was the victim of "revenge porn," according to court documents obtained by USA TODAY.

Combs videotaped the January 1991 assault and distributed the tape to others in the music industry, according to the suit. This caused "severe harm to Ms. Dickerson-Neal's reputation, career prospects, and emotional well-being," Dickerson-Neal's attorney, Jonathan Goldhirsch, said in a news release sent to USA TODAY Thursday.

Bad Boy Entertainment, Bad Boy Records and Combs Enterprises are listed as defendants in the suit as well. Dickerson demands a trial by jury.

The latest accusations against Combs stem from a time period in which the now-billionaire was just beginning his rise to prominence. In 1991, he had not yet released his debut album "No Way Out." At the time, according to the filing, Combs was working as a talent director at Uptown Records.

Both Dickerson-Neal and Combs shared mutual friends and acquaintances, the suit says. Dickerson-Neal also once appeared with Combs in a music video.

Sean 'Diddy' Combs allegedly drugged, raped Joi Dickerson-Neal

While on a school break for the holidays in 1991, Dickerson-Neal − who was a college student at Syracuse University at the time − "reluctantly agreed" to dinner with Combs, the suit says.

"During their date, Combs had intentionally drugged (Dickerson-Neal), resulting in her being in a physical state where she could not independently stand or walk," the suit alleges. Combs allegedly spiked her drink when Dickerson-Neal left her drink unattended to use the restroom, the suit reads.

After dinner, which was held at a location where she had worked as a server, the two continued to spend the night together. Dickerson-Neal recalls Combs taking her to a music studio, and then to his home where the assault allegedly took place. According to the suit, she felt "humiliated and hurt, yet she could not escape the assault."

Following the alleged sexual assault, "a male friend (also identified as Davante Swing, a member of R&B group Jodeci, in the suit) revealed to (Dickerson-Neal) that he had viewed the 'sex tape' along with other men."

Dickerson-Neal asked Swing who had seen the video, and he replied: "Everyone."

Sean 'Diddy' Combs denies Joi Dickerson-Neal's allegations

A spokesperson for Combs said in a statement Thursday that this "last-minute lawsuit is an example of how a well-intentioned law can be turned on its head."

"Ms. Dickerson's 32-year-old story is made up and not credible," the statement to TMZ continued. "Mr. Combs never assaulted her and she implicates companies that did not exist. This is purely a money grab and nothing more."

Michelle Caiola, another attorney for Combs' accuser, said in a release sent to USA TODAY, "We are privileged to assist our client, Ms. Dickerson-Neal, as she courageously steps forward in an effort to hold Mr. Combs to account. Everyone deserves to be heard and Combs should not be immune from liability because of his wealth and public stature."

Joi Dickerson-Neal suffered from depression, suicide ideation after alleged Diddy sexual assault

The Thursday filing alleges that after Dickerson-Neal was sexually assaulted by Combs, she was admitted to the hospital for "severe depression and suicide ideation."

"The sexual assault and public exposure of it, caused her to suffer overwhelming feelings of humiliation, embarrassment, violation, and constant apprehension about who all viewed it," the filing adds. "As Combs' success and wealth rose quickly, she tried to block his existence out a she tried to put her life back on track."

The suit alleges that Combs repeatedly pursued Dickerson-Neal for "a romantic or sexual relationship," but that because she had heard the mogul had "a history of treating women badly," she rejected his advances.

Sister Soulja, a rapper from the Bronx, had even warned Dickerson-Neal about becoming involved with Combs after the two had been featured together in the music video for "Straight From the Soul" by Finesse and Synquis, the suit adds.

Cassie sues Sean 'Diddy' Combs, settle bombshell lawsuit alleging rape, abuse, sex trafficking

One day after Cassie accused Combs of rape, sex trafficking and physical abuse in a lawsuit, both parties announced that a resolution had been reached. They did not disclose a settlement amount.

Casandra Ventura, known professionally as singer Cassie, filed a sex trafficking and sexual assault lawsuit on Nov. 17 against ex-boyfriend Combs in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, according to court documents obtained by USA TODAY.

In a statement on Nov. 18, Cassie said, "I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control. I want to thank my family, fans and lawyers for their unwavering support."

"We have decided to resolve this matter amicably. I wish Cassie and her family all the best," Combs said in a separate statement. "Love."

The suit, which named Combs and his companies including Bad Boy Entertainment, Bad Boy Records, Combs Enterprises, LLC, and Epic Records, sought unspecified monetary damages.

The lawsuit alleges that Cassie, who began a professional and sexual relationship with the rap mogul when she was 19, was trafficked, raped and viciously beaten by Combs over the course of a decade.

What is the Adult Survivors Act?

The complaint was filed under New York’s Adult Survivors Act, which has given victims of sexual abuse a one-year window for claims that would otherwise be barred by time limits. It is set to expire after Thanksgiving.

Goldhirsch added Thursday: "Our client has not been able to escape the continuing impact of the harm Combs caused her many years ago. Through the Adult Survivors Act, she can avail herself to the courts to finally seek justice."

In recent days leading up to the Adult Survivors Act deadline, Jamie Foxx, Combs' former Bad Boy president Harve Pierre, Axl Rose, Interscope Records co-founder Jimmy Iovine and Cuba Gooding Jr. have all been sued for sexual assault.

If you are a survivor of sexual assault, RAINN offers support through the National Sexual Assault Hotline (800.656.HOPE & online.rainn.org).

If you or someone you know may be struggling with suicidal thoughts, you can call or text the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 any time day or night, or chat online at 988lifeline.org.
