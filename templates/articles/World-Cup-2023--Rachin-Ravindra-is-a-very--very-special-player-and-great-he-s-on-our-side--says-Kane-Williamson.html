                <textarea id="text" readonly> Kane Williamson heaped praise on Rachin Ravindra and called him a 'very,very special player' after his fantastic run in the World Cup 2023 campaign. Ravindra has scored more than 500 runs in the ongoing tournament.

"Yeah. Incredible. Look, clearly an amazing talent and sort of just entered the side and in the international arena and to walk into a World Cup and not just any World Cup but here in India and in a lot of ways come into a role that perhaps when he's had exposure in our team, he hasn't played in that opening sort of top three, top order spot and do what he's done is amazing. We sort of knew the talent was there, but to come out and repeat and be one of the players of the tournament so far, not only with the bat, but he's also making really valuable contributions with the ball. Yeah, very, very special player and great that he's on our side," said Williamson. </textarea>
