GRANVILLE, Ohio (August 3, 2023) – Denison University rising sophomore men's tennis playeris currently representing both the Big Red and his country of Kenya at the Davis Cup, which is commonly referred to as the World Cup for tennis.After transferring to Denison for the Spring 2023 semester, Shah proceeded to finish 10-7 overall in singles, including records of 7-4 at No. 1 singles and 5-0 in North Coast Athletic Conference matches, all en route to helping the Big Red win both the NCAC regular-season and tournament championships. According to his coach, Kael is in line to be one of the best Division III players in the country in 2023-24."To see a college player competing for their country in Davis Cup is an incredible opportunity," spoke Denison Head Men's Tennis Coach. "When I was at Ohio State, we had a couple of kids who had this honor, however, for a Division III player to receive this chance is really rare. Kael is one of the best tennis players in Division III, with an incredible upside.""It was an honor to be called up to represent my country at such a high stage for the second year running," said Shah. "It is a lot of pride to be part of a team playing in the Davis Cup and competing against various countries for promotion to a higher group. It also gives me a chance to learn from some of the older people on my team who have been playing this event for many years. The most exciting thing about this event is almost like you are traveling on the tour. Since it is such a highly regarded competition, there are chair umpires, line judges and ball kids which allows you to feel like what professionals feel. I'm also looking forward to competing with some of the best players in Africa and hopefully making my country proud.""Kael came to Denison last year mid-year after transferring from Division I," said Schilling. "It took him some time to adjust to what we were doing and the tempo and pace that we train with. In addition, he struggled with some injuries early in the semester. I am sure he didn't get as many playing chances as he would have liked. However, Kael never wavered and worked extremely hard. He trusted his coaches and teammates and was playing No. 1 singles by the end of the year in the NCAA championship. He had an incredibly hectic first year in the US - but showed what he is made of with his positive attitude and great work ethic. We are expecting big things from Kael this year and beyond.""My freshman year at Denison was challenging but super enjoyable," continued Shah. "I joined a team with players from various cultures which helped me adapt. I got the opportunity to play many matches and experience what college tennis is like for the first time. We have a great team of players that together with hard work and dedication we can achieve a lot together. We also have Schills who gives his full effort every day and motivates us to be a better version of ourselves every day. We can achieve big things this year."So far, Shah has gone 3-1 in singles at the Davis Cup with wins vs. Botswana, Cameroon and Nigeria."This achievement comes with a lot of help from my parents, coaches and teammates over the years," concluded Shah. "My parents for all the support they have given me through all these years. The academy I was training at in Barcelona that helped me grow as an individual as well as a student-athlete. And also, Schills, who put a lot of trust in me to come in as a mid-year transfer and help the program reach new heights. He helped me settle into a new place pretty fast and created an environment that helped my teammates and I grow."1st DayKenya V Ghana-vs Isaac Nortey (12.48utr) - 3/6, 6/3, 4/62nd dayKenya V Botswana-vs Esi Molefe (9.07utr) - 6/1, 6/03rd dayKenya vs Cameroon-vs Boriss Kamdem (11.28utr) - 6/4, 6/24th dayKenya vs Nigeria-vs David Ekpenyong (11.48) - 6/1, 6/3 </textarea>
