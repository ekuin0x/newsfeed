                <textarea id="text" readonly> Video game related gifts top kids’ Christmas wishlists, with gaming subscriptions the most sought-after products.

That’s according to an Ipsos poll of 501 US children aged 10-17, which was conducted on behalf of the Entertainment Software Association (ESA).

It found that 72% of respondents plan to ask for video game gifts for Christmas, ahead of money/gift cards (70%), clothes/accessories (66%), electronics/tech items (62%), physical toys and games (38%), tickets and experiences (32%), arts and crafts (28%) and books (26%).

Of those hoping to receive video game-related gifts, 39% said they plan to ask for subscriptions, ahead of consoles (38%), game gear/accessories (32%), in-game currency (29%) and physical video games (22%).

The Ipsos survey also included a sample of 500 adults aged 18-65. Almost a third (32%) said they planned to buy video game gifts for themselves or others.

These respondents expected to spend an average of $485 on game-related presents this holiday season.

“More than 212 million Americans play video games regularly, so it comes as no surprise that games are at the top of this year’s wish lists,” commented ESA president Stan Pierre-Louis.

“Whether a family is getting a new console, updating their controllers and headsets or adding to their library with new games and expansion packs, we know video games are a great tool for families to play together and connect during the holiday season and beyond.”

Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 was the best-selling game in the US last month, while PS5 was once again the leading console platform.

Total US consumer spending on game hardware, content and accessories in October fell 5% year-over-year to $4 billion, partially driven by Call of Duty moving from an October release in 2022 to a November release this year. Year-to-date consumer spending is up 2% to $43.4 billion. </textarea>
