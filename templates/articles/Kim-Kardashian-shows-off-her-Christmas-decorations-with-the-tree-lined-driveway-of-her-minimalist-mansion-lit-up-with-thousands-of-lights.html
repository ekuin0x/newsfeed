                <textarea id="text" readonly> Kim Kardashian is in the festive spirit, showing off her lavish decorations at her $60million Calabasas home.

The TV icon shared a video with her 364million Instagram followers on Monday, giving a peek at her minimalist mansion decorated with thousands of lights.

The short clip showed Kim being driven up the drive way of her house, with trees on either side decorated with tiny white lights.

As the automatic gates opened yet more trees could be seen planted on the grass and covered in the twinkling lights.

Kim, who lives in the $60million mansion with her four children, famously favours a minimalist interiors style.

The house is said to have been designed with the help of minimalist architect Claudio Silvestrin who worked on her ex husband Kanye West's loft in Manhattan.

In an interview with Vogue Magazine last year, she declared 'everything in my house is really minimal.'

'I find that there is so much chaos out in the world, that when I come home I want to be just really quiet.'

The mother-of-four added that 'shockingly... my kids haven't messed up my cream house.'

Last month Kylie Jenner playfully bashed her half-sister for her minimalist home on Hulu's The Kardashians.

The episode saw Kim visiting Kylie at her house, with Kim telling her: 'I gotta check out this house and see the hoarding vibes,' but her sister insisted:

'I don't have a hoarding problem. You're just a minimalist and you don't have anything in your house.'

Kylie added in confession, 'As far as her like having like one couch in her living room, like that's not me, you know?'

'Her house like echoes because there is just no furniture, and I'm not like down for that at all.'
