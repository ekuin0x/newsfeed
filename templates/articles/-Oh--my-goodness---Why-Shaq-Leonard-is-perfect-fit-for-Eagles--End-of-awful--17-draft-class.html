                <textarea id="text" readonly> PHILADELPHIA − There are many reasons why Shaq Leonard would be an ideal fit for the Eagles after the former Pro Bowl Colts linebacker was waived last week.

It goes beyond the fact that the Eagles have a need now that Nakobe Dean is back on injured reserve with a foot injury that could keep him out for several weeks, if not the rest of the season. Leonard was a Pro Bowl selection in three of his first four seasons, including his rookie year in 2018.

But Leonard had a second back surgery in the summer of 2022 and hasn't been the same since. Leonard cleared waivers on Wednesday and is free to sign with any team.

Eagles cornerback Darius Slay said the Eagles would be a perfect fit.

He has seen the Eagles integrate veterans in safety Kevin Byard, nickel corner Bradley Roby and wide receiver Julio Jones during this season. Last season, the Eagles did the same with veteran defensive tackles Linval Joseph and Ndamukong Suh.

"If he (signs), oh, my goodness," Slay said. "If I was him, I’d for sure want to be here, Kansas City. Who else?"

There aren’t many others, and the reason is simple.

"If we get to that age in your lifetime in the football world, and if I was one of those guys just out there at home and chilling, and a team called me that’s 9-1, 10-1, Yes! Yes! I’m coming," Slay said. "I want a championship. I want to be able to play in the playoffs. I want to do those type of things. So if I was a veteran guy, I would go to a winning situation.

"I’m not signing up for no (losing). I’m coming to win."

Of course, there would likely be a sacrifice involved for Leonard if he was to sign with the Eagles.

Suh and Joseph experienced it last season when they had to play in a rotation instead of playing just about every snap as they had throughout their careers. Roby, to some extent, is experiencing it now at nickel as he works his way back into football shape.

Leonard would most likely serve in a rotation at linebacker with veterans Nicholas Morrow and Zach Cunningham.

That might have led to Leonard's release in Indianapolis as his playing time diminished this season. Leonard was playing 70% of the defensive snaps this season after playing close to 100% in each of his first four seasons.

Leonard had 163 tackles, seven sacks, four forced fumbles and two interceptions as a rookie, when he got the nickname "Maniac." Leonard had five INTs and five sacks to go along with 121 tackles in 2019. He had eight forced fumbles, four interceptions and 122 tackles in 2021.

But Leonard has 65 tackles and no sacks or interceptions this season. It would be hard to see Leonard playing as much as he did earlier in his career.

The Eagles could definitely use him, though. The only other inside linebacker on the 53-man roster is Christian Elliss, and he's used exclusively on special teams. The Eagles have twice given the practice-squad elevation to undrafted rookie free agent Ben VanSumeren while Dean has been on IR. But VanSumeren has yet to see a snap on defense.

Leonard, of course, knows Eagles coach Nick Sirianni well. Sirianni was the Colts' offensive coordinator for Leonard's first three seasons in Indianapolis.

In addition, Colts head coach Shane Steichen was the Eagles' offensive coordinator the previous two seasons. No doubt, Steichen could give the Eagles inside information about Leonard's playing ability this season.

If all of that checks out, Roby can vouch for it working out with the Eagles. Roby was a first-round draft pick of the Denver Broncos in 2014. He then went on to the Houston Texans and the Saints, who waived him at the end of training camp.

Roby said he could have signed with other teams right away. But he decided to wait.

"This is exactly what I wanted," Roby said about the Eagles. "This is what I waited for at the end of the day. ... I’m not going to say any specific teams, but there were teams reaching out, wanting me to come in, play Week 1, play Week 2. But I just really wanted to come to a scenario where I felt like a team that was going to win that actually needed me.

"And then Philly called, and I’m like, ‘That’s it, right there.’ It just fell into place."

There is one difference with Leonard as opposed to the other players the Eagles brought in mid-season: Leonard is 28 years old, while the others were well into their 30s.

Then again, like the others, Leonard is not the same player he was before the back surgeries. But getting a chance with the Eagles, even if it's not as an every-down linebacker, can serve as an audition for next season.

At the very least, Leonard would have a chance to win a Super Bowl ring while doing it. The Colts have won just one playoff game in Leonard's five-plus seasons.

"He’s maybe still can be a top 2, top 3 linebacker in the league," Slay said. "I don’t know the situation. That’s not my problem. But yeah, if that guy comes over here, the Mr. Maniac, look here, all right. We’ll find a way to bring that Maniac back."

Derek Barnett waived, last of awful 2017 draft class

The Eagles waived defensive end Derek Barnett on Friday, ending his mostly disappointing stay in Philadelphia.

Barnett was the Eagles' first-round pick in 2017. That turned out to be his most memorable season. Barnett had a strip-sack in the NFC Championship game that season and recovered Brandon Graham's strip-sack on Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in the final minutes of the Super Bowl to preserve the Eagles' first-ever Super Bowl victory.

But injuries and ill-timed penalties marred Barnett's career. He had a career-high 6½ sacks in 2019 and 5½ sacks in 2020. He missed all but one game in 2022 after tearing his ACL. Barnett didn't have any sacks this season.

Barnett finished his Eagles career with 21½ sacks − and 26 penalties.

Barnett was a healthy scratch against Dallas on Nov. 5 and left the team for personal reasons against Kansas City.

He was the last remaining player from the 2017 draft that consisted of CB Sidney Jones (2nd round), CB Rasul Douglas (3rd round), WR Mack Hollins and RB Donnel Pumphrey (4th round), WR Shelton Gibson and LB Nathan Gerry (5th round) and DT Elijah Qualls (6th round).

Jones is with the Bengals' practice quad, Douglas is with the Bills and Hollins is with the Falcons. The rest are out of football.
