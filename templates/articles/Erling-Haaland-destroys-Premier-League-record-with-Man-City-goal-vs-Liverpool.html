                <textarea id="text" readonly> Nobody has reached 50 Premier League goals as quickly as the Manchester City striker - indeed, nobody has got anywhere near his new record

Indeed, he is inevitable.

Erling Haaland scored his 50th Premier League goal in just his 48th game for Manchester City in the top flight, when he opened the scoring in Saturday's clash against Liverpool at the Etihad.

The Norwegian's left-footed finish in the 27th minute meant he had reached the half century quicker than anyone else. And not just quicker. It meant he absolutely obliterated Andy Cole's record. Cole scored 50 Premier League goals in 65 games. Haaland did it in 17 fewer matches. Simply astonishing.

"That's some going" responded Gary Lineker on social media. The ex-England striker turned Match of the Day presenter knows a thing or two about finding the back of the net of course.

Haaland isn't the youngest player to reach the milestone, at the age of 23. That distinction remains with Robbie Fowler, who was just 20 when he bagged his 50th Premier League goal.

Haaland is now well out in front on a star-studded list that includes the aforementioned England duo, as well as Alan Shearer (66 games), Ruud van Nistelrooy (68 games), Fernando Torres and Mohamed Salah (both 72 games)

In truth, he was given helping hand by Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson. His kick, trying to get Salah running clear, wasn't to his usual high standard and fell straight to City. Two passes later, Haaland was clean through and while he maybe didn't strike the ball as cleanly as he would like, he still got enough on it to find the bottom corner.

Haaland's latest record-breaking feat comes after his remarkable debut season in English football last term, where he fired City to a Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup treble.

He scored 36 Premier League goals during his debut campaign and notched 52 in 53 games in all competitions.

With the 50 milestone now passed, Haaland will be eyeing Shearer's 100 goals record. The Premier League's all-time top scorer took 124 games to reach his century, giving Haaland 76 games to nab his next 50 and make that record his own too.
