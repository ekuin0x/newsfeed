                <textarea id="text" readonly> Target’s Black Friday sale might be over, but the retail giant has rolled straight into Cyber Monday with deals of up to 50 percent off luggage, toiletry bags, comfy clothes, and sneakers. To make your shopping experience a breeze, I sifted through the hundreds of thousands of discounts to find the 20 worth adding to your virtual cart.

Before your next winter vacation, consider investing in this American Tourister carry-on that “fits everything,” according to reviewers, or this seven-piece packing cube set that was made for overpackers. Keep scrolling to browse additional Target Cyber Monday deals on jackets, puffer vests, cozy slippers, and more, hand-picked by a frequent traveler and shopping writer. Even though you have a few days left to shop, products are selling out fast.

Best Target Early Cyber Monday Deals

American Tourister NXT Checkered Hardside Carry-On Spinner Suitcase

Target

This American Tourister suitcase is my tried and true carry-on thanks to its airflow spinner wheels that help me glide through the airport with ease, and its space expansion is crucial for an overpacker like me. Shoppers praised the 50 percent-off luggage for its “perfect” size that “fits everything.” Another customer said that it moves around “very easily” and they’re “able to handle sharp turns on all four wheels.” Plus, the 20-inch bag comes with interior pockets and compartments for added space.

Bearpaw Retro Loki Slippers

Target

Target shoppers love these “comfy” and “stylish” Bearpaw platform slippers that boast a cozy sheepskin lining. One customer described them as a “quick on-the-go shoe that can be worn universally” and “dressed up” or “down.” The slippers are currently available in three in-stock colors and are so comfortable that they’ve even “helped” one reviewer with their “back pain.”

Open Story Packing Cube

Target

Open Story’s seven-piece packing cube set is the secret to getting the most out of your suitcase space. The 30 percent-off deal gets you six packing cubes and one shoe box, including a large packing cube, a medium packing cube, a small packing cube, and a laundry bag. The material is also constructed of a soft fabric, so it’s flexible, while the mesh top allows you to see what’s in each case. According to one shopper, the set has allowed them to “feel more organized” and “fit more” in a carry-on suitcase. Another person called the packing cubes a “game changer” and said that it's the “most amazing product” for “easier” travel.

S.E.B. by Sebby Faux Leather Short Puffer Vest

Target

I am always freezing on flights, so an extra layer is essential anytime I’m heading to the airport. Even if the air conditioning doesn’t get to me, it’s the perfect makeshift pillow for a quick plane nap. This faux leather puffer vest accomplishes just that with the bonus of an elevated design that’s perfect for transitioning from a flight straight to dinner. You can wear it with leggings for a laid-back look or style it with jeans and a sweater for just about any occasion.
