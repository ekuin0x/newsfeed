It’s a week that takes us through the final days of November and into our last month of the year, holding an emphasis on our minds, our beliefs, and our desires. We are met with a culminating full Moon in Gemini and Mercury shifting into the grounded earth sign of Capricorn.

Gemini Full Moon

We meet a full Moon when the Sun and Moon are in direct opposition to one another in our cosmos. As the Sun journeys through Sagittarius, the Moon comes into fullness in Gemini on November 27, 2023. Highlighting the axis upon which these two opposing zodiac signs live, the Moon spotlights, as if from within, the ways of being, identities, narratives, and more that we are ready to release.

In astrology, Mercury is the ruler of Gemini. In mythology, Mercury is the only god that could and would willingly move in between the heavens as well as into the underworld, living and learning and relaying information from these two seemingly opposing sides of life.

Our mind has this same capacity. Layered and multi-faceted, the mind is an antenna to all that exists above and below, taking us into the highest of divine spaces as well as the lowest places in our own personal underworld. The mind can create and experience both freedom and limitation within the same external reality.

This full Moon brings our mind to the forefront of our awareness. We can feel, sense, unravel, and receive much within the body and the unconscious mind. Only when it comes into conscious awareness can its influence become known. And only when this happens can we begin working with it.

Bringing something into our conscious awareness to explore and understand it is the doorway into receiving its power, insight, impact, and partnership. What is unconscious can seem to hold power over us, but as soon as it is brought into the light of consciousness, that grip can no longer take hold.

The full Moon brings to consciousness all that was once hidden and unknown within the mind, uncovering the narratives that have been shaping and creating our lives in ways that we wouldn’t choose. It brings to light the stories, the ideas, and the perspectives that shape our experiences as we move through the world.

Mercury in Capricorn

The beginning of December coincides with Mercury shifting into Capricorn, where it will remain until December 23, 2023. As the planet enters Capricorn, it somewhat of a preparation for our final Mercury retrograde of the year beginning on December 13 and lasting until January 2, 2024.

Mercury represents our thoughts, perspectives, communication, mental processing, and the lens through which we look. As it dances through the signs of the zodiac, our minds become colored by each sign. During December, it is if we are putting on glasses that seem to be Capricorn-colored.

A grounded, practical, and ambitious earth sign, Capricorn is an archetype that desires mastery for each of us. It holds an image of all that we could be if we so desired and dedicated ourselves to becoming. It invites us to take the big visioning of our dreams and desires, to place them right in front of us, and tend to the practicalities of the how.

Mercury in Capricorn continues the story of our Gemini full Moon in that it brings our awareness to the mind and the narratives that seem to be dictating the way we move through the world. Do we believe we can live our desires? Do we believe our dreams are available for us? Do we believe we are a match for our mountain? This transit is an invitation to look practically, not only at the beliefs we hold but also the grounded details of our desires for the year to come.

Your Invitation

This week’s full Moon acts as a torch shining the light of consciousness onto what you are ready to release, reframe, or unravel. It brings into your awareness what is coming to its natural place of ending—or perhaps what actually met this ending long ago. And it all happens within the mind, which creates your interior landscape and is an entire world of its own. What do you desire to be present within that landscape? How do you want it to feel there? What do we want to be available there?

To tend to the mind as if it were a canvas in front of you is what you can choose under this full Moon, a choice that sets the stage for you to receive the medicine of Mercury in Capricorn a few days later. Where you are invited to believe that you can, and begin to look practically at your dreams for the year ahead.

Given that the week’s movements are held within the arms of Sagittarius season, you are encouraged to dream big and to continue opening up wider and further to the future that is calling your name. Bringing Capricorn’s ambitious, clarifying, grounded, productive, and disciplined energy into this space seems like the perfect pathway for those dreams to begin to ground themselves within your reality.
