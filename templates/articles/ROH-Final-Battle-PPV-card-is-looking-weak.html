                <textarea id="text" readonly> Ring of Honor has a lot of work to do to produce an enticing lineup for Final Battle. The PPV is coming around the corner on Friday, Dec. 15 in Garland, Texas. There is only one official match announced so far, but the problems run deeper than that.

Final Battle had a lot of potential for star power not too long ago. Eddie Kingston is working hard as ROH world champion. MJF and Adam Cole have the ROH tag team titles as brochachos for life. Samoa Joe broke records with the ROH television strap. Hangman Page and the Young Bucks were carrying ROH six-man gold. Katsuyori Shibata added depth as an attraction with technical clinics defending the ROH Pure Championship.

Fast forward to 20 days before show time, and the ROH landscape is completely different.

Kingston is wagering the ROH World Championship as part of the Continental Classic winner’s pot. It wouldn’t make any sense logically for a title defense at Final Battle. Cole suffered a terrible ankle injury. MJF has carried the load in Cole’s absence, however, MJF has his own injury issues to deal with. AEW may prefer to play it safe and have MJF rest until he defends the AEW World Championship against Samoa Joe at Worlds End on December 30. That PPV is taking place in MJF’s home of Long Island, so AEW shouldn’t take any unnecessary risks with the champ’s health.

Speaking of Joe, he vacated the ROH World Television Championship to focus on AEW’s top prize. The Hung Bucks lost the ROH World Six-Man Championship back to Brian Cage and the Gates of Agony. A rubber match would make sense, however, the current direction of the Young Bucks involves rumors of a break from wrestling. Plus, Bishop Kaun and Toa Liona are busy with the NJPW World Tag League, so that doesn’t leave time to build a new feud. Shibata was dethroned via underhanded treachery courtesy of Wheeler Yuta. Rumors suggest Shibata is returning to Japan for the time being, so kiss that rematch goodbye for Final Battle.

The one official contest for Final Battle is Survival of the Fittest for the vacant ROH television title. No participants have been named yet for that six-way fight.

Even though the outlook is weak right now, that’s not to say the card will be a dud. One thing about PPVs in the Tony Khan universe is that they always deliver great wrestling.

Athena is the anchor of ROH TV with the ROH Women’s World Championship. She may be in line to get the main event nod for Final Battle. Athena has closed the show before and knocked it out of the park. The question becomes who would be a suitable opponent for a main event PPV. The name most will want to see is Ronda Rousey. The Baddest Woman on the Planet was awesome in her surprise debut for ROH, however, that appeared to be a one-off match. A different direction could be the return of Thunder Rosa from injury. As far as weekly storylines go, I don’t see an obvious choice on the main event level.

MJF may very well be on the card. The Kingdom have stated their intentions to acquire the ROH World Tag Team Championship. If MJF drops the titles before Cole returns, the duo of Matt Taven and Mike Bennett make the most sense. It is conceivable that MJF loses the belts before Final Battle, and the Kingdom defend on the PPV against fresh competition. What are the Lucha Brothers doing?

Yuta is heading for a showdown with Hook. A pure clash would be worthy for Final Battle. Dante Martin announced his return from injury. Top Flight and Action Andretti would make for exciting challengers to the ROH six-man titles.

We won’t have to wait long to see how Final Battle shapes up.

What do you think the Final Battle card will be? Which matches are you hoping to see? </textarea>
