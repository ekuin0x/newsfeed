                <textarea id="text" readonly> With one of the most high-powered offenses coming to town this weekend, the Carolina Panthers really could’ve benefitted from the return of cornerback Jaycee Horn. Unfortunately, he’s just not there right now.

Horn was one of four players ruled out for the Week 11 contest against the Dallas Cowboys this afternoon. The 23-year-old, who has not played since the regular-season opener due to a hamstring injury, was designated to return from injured reserve to begin the week.

But head coach Frank Reich told reporters on Friday that Horn isn’t ready yet.

“Continued good progress, but not quite enough,” Reich said. “So, we’ll just continue to take that day by day, week by week.”

Horn has struggled to stay on the field throughout his three-year NFL career. He missed the final 14 games of his rookie campaign due to a broken foot and four games last season with a rib injury and a broken wrist.

Since being selected with the eighth overall pick of the 2021 draft, Horn has played in 17 of a possible 42 games.

In his place for the 43rd game may be Dicaprio Bootle, who will likely be making his second straight start for Carolina. Reich spoke a bit about the 26-year-old defender, who has been rather impressive over the last two weeks.

“Bootle did a nice job,” he said. “You step up and it’s just more consistency, more playmaking. And I think Bootle has given us that, but you’re always lookin’ to get better. And for all of us, for every player and coach, it’s about consistency and then make a couple plays in a game that break the game—a turnover, a call. Whatever the case may be.”

Well, the Panthers are definitely going to need at least a couple of those plays on Sunday.
