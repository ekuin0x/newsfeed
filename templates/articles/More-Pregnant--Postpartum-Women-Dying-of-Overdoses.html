                <textarea id="text" readonly> A January study found mortality rates for pregnant women and new mothers worsened during the pandemic, and a new study zeroes in on one such cause: overdoses. Researchers with the National Institute on Drug Abuse reviewed data on more than 17,000 deaths over the 2018 to 2021 period; STAT reports the group consisted of about 1,500 pregnant and postpartum overdose deaths, 4,800 non-overdose maternal deaths, and 11,200 non-pregnant overdose deaths. Their study published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry finds the mortality ratio tied to overdoses more than tripled among pregnant and postpartum women ages 35 to 44: from 4.9 per 100,000 mothers with a live birth in January 2018 to June 2018, to 15.8 in July 2021 to December 2021.

The Washington Post reports the majority of these overdoses involved opioids, chief among them fentanyl. The researchers noted that most pregnancy-associated overdose deaths happened outside health care settings, "indicating the need for strengthening community outreach and maternal medical support." They conclude that "evidence-based interventions are urgently needed at individual, health care, local, and national levels, along with nonpunitive approaches incentivizing pregnant and postpartum women to seek substance use disorder treatments."

As for the latter point, the Post speaks with an epidemiologist who elaborates: "For a lot of pregnant and postpartum people, disclosing drug use might result in your child being taken away, so there is a lot of stigma beyond just the standard amount of stigma you get."
