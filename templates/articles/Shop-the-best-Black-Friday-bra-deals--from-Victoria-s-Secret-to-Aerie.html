Bras — the commonly reached-for article of clothing that, despite a near-everyday wear, you don’t want to grab it for full price.

We get it, and that’s why it’s important to hunt down for good bra deals. Luckily, it’s Black Friday, and the bra deals are pretty epic.

After all, you won’t feel and look your best without the right fit (which is why we have an entire guide on how to measure your bra size at home). From push-ups to lounge-inspired bralettes, this edit has all the lovely styles on sale.

The New York Post cherry-picked top options from Amazon, Aerie, Victoria’s Secret, Parade and more to add to your cart for a much-needed wardrobe stock-up. While you’re shopping, best sure to check out our guide to the best clothing and style deals today has to offer as well.

FYI, you surely need to shop Amazon deals, in general.

Amazon

We can’t believe the price, either. Shop the Playtex Smoothing Wireless Bra for one of the most comfortable fits that won’t cost you more than $15. Not to mention, the garment is backed by more than 26,000 gleaming reviews.

Amazon

For less than $25 on Amazon, the Maidenform One Fab Fit Underwire Demi T-Shirt Bra is a top-rated style that’s available in a variety of colors. Not to mention, it’s the “everyday” bra worth picking up.

Amazon

For seamless support and a bit of a lift, grab the Hanes Ultimate Wireless Moisture-Wicking T-Shirt Bra. We love its dreamy softness (one you can wear to sleep, BTW).

Aerie

One of our favorite styles we wear on repeat is the Aerie Superchill Cozy Lace Ribbed Bra Top. It’s the ideal lounge piece for any time of year — paired well with your favorite lounge pants or pajamas.

Victoria's Secret

We’re mesmerized by the Victoria’s Secret Shine Cradle Push-Up Bra. It has to be the most beautiful (and flattering, and sexiest) bra we’ve seen — available in a roster of must-have colors for less than $50 right now.

Parade

Shoppers love Parade — and we do, too. This Black Friday, styles are up to 80% off (yes, you read that correctly). Notably, the Parade Dream Plunge Bra is one to grab for a toss-on, easy fit.

Intimissimi

For a bra with a lingerie lean, the Intimissimi Satin Darlings Silvia Push-Up Bra is our favorite. After all, we can’t deny feeling our most confident selves in white lace — and the brand has an entire catalog of bras and matching undies to choose from.

Adore Me

The Adore Me Clairabelle Push-Up Bra is a style we can’t recommend enough, made perfect for days where you want something to slip on with a bit more of a design. Its colorways are delightful, too.

lululemon

We can’t forget about the sports bras this Black Friday (and, of course, we point to lululemon). The Flow Y Nulu Longline Bra is our top pick thanks to its unyielding support and pretty-in-pastels color palette. Plus, it’s ideal for yoga, running errands — and pretty much everything, TBH).

SKIMS

If there’s one thing Kim K knows, it’s how to design flattering bras in a plethora of neutrals. The SKIMS Fits Everybody Plunge Bra is now less than $35 (!!!) and we’re beyond obsessed. In fact, shop the entire brand for limited-time savings.
