Linda Evangelista has not dated anyone since a botched CoolSculpting procedure left her “permanently deformed.”

“Not interested. I don’t want to sleep with anybody anymore. I don’t want to hear somebody breathing,” the supermodel candidly told the Sunday Times.

Evangelista, 58, tried to recall the last time she went on a date but could only remember it was “definitely before” CoolSculpting “brutally disfigured” her face and body in 2016.

She sued parent company Zeltiq Aesthetics Inc. for $50 million before settling last year.

The catwalker — who has kept her love life mostly private for the past two decades — was previously married to Elite Model Management boss Gérald Marie from 1987 to 1993.

Earlier this year, she accused him of physically abusing her.

“I was clueless. Absolutely clueless,” she said in Apple TV+’s “The Super Models” of marrying Marie when she was just 22 years old. “Well, there had to be something endearing to fall for. I was afraid.”

Evangelista claimed “there was a deal made” between herself and the agency head that if she “didn’t speak,” she “would be safe.”

She later revealed that she spent the money from her modeling career to get “out of” the marriage.

Evangelista also recalled getting out of the union “safe” with her “freedom.”

“It wasn’t a matter of just saying, ‘I want a divorce, see ya.’ It doesn’t work that way,” she said in the docuseries, which premiered in September.

The legendary model claimed that Marie “knew not to touch [her] face, not to touch the money maker.”

Marie, 73, vehemently denied the claims, saying he “has never committed the slightest act of violence.”

Evangelista later briefly dated French businessman François-Henri Pinault, with whom she shares 17-year-old son Augustin.

She famously kept the paternity of her only child private until 2011 when she battled Pinault for child support. They eventually settled out of court. </textarea>
