                <textarea id="text" readonly> A nearly-perfect fall day, at least weather-wise, is in store for college football fans in Alabama.

Alabama, Auburn, UAB and North Alabama are all playing at home today (Oct. 21) and will have warm (but not hot) temperatures and partly sunny skies to work with.

The National Weather Service is forecasting dewpoints to be very low (so low there is a red flag warning in place for the northern half of the state) and it could be breezy at times, especially in north Alabama.

Troy, South Alabama, Alabama State, Alabama A&M and Jacksonville State are off this Saturday.

Here is the forecast for todayâ€™s games:

MEMPHIS VS. UAB, 11 A.M., PROTECTIVE STADIUM IN BIRMINGHAM

Game time temperature: 71 degrees, rising to 80 degrees by 1 p.m. Partly cloudy skies with southwest winds at 5-10 mph.

TENNESSEE VS. ALABAMA, 2:30 P.M., BRYANT-DENNY STADIUM IN TUSCALOOSA

Game time temperature: 82 degrees, falling only to 76 degrees by 5 p.m. Partly cloudy skies and southwest winds at 5-10 mph.

OLE MISS VS. AUBURN, 6 P.M., JORDAN-HARE STADIUM IN AUBURN

Game time temperature 70 degrees, falling to 65 degrees by 9 p.m. Partly cloudy skies and southwest winds 5-10 mph.

UTAH TECH VS. NORTH ALABAMA, BRALY MUNICIPAL STADIUM, FLORENCE, 6 P.M.

Game time temperature 78 degrees, falling to 67 degrees by 9 p.m. Partly cloudy with west winds around 10 mph, gusting as high as 15 mph. </textarea>
