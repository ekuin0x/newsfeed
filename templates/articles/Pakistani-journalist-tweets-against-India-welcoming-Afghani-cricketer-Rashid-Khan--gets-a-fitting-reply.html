One Pakistani journalist, Farid Khan, swiftly shared his thoughts on social media, commenting, "Rashid Khan is flying to India for the World Cup üá¶üá´‚ô•Ô∏è Rashid bhai is receiving better treatment from India than us. Anyway, best wishes to him and Afghanistan ‚úÖ #WorldCup2023 #CWC23."This statement irked many netizens who were well aware of India's warm hospitality, especially towards sports personalities like Khan.A devoted Afghan fan, Wazhma Ayoubi, calmly and articulately provided a fitting response to the Pakistani journalist, listing three compelling reasons why the Afghan cricketer deserved this "special treatment":"Why shouldn't he receive better treatment? I'm sure you're already aware, but allow me to remind you:A: He deserves it as the most beloved Afghan cricketer in India and worldwide.B: He boasts numerous records, currently holding the top position as the world's best T20 bowler. What have you accomplished?C: India and Afghanistan are like brothers," explained the netizen.Her response, brimming with logical reasoning, quickly went viral on social media, getting over 1.5 million views, with numerous netizens applauding her for her reply.Many users echoed her sentiments, with comments such as "Well said," "Rashid is a hero, a true champion. His records are simply astounding. India is Rashid's second home," and "Rashid is a star player in India."Additionally, it's worth noting that the Pakistani journalist highlighted the special treatment received by select individuals, even though the entire Pakistani cricket team secured their Indian visas under 48 hours before their departure.The team is scheduled to play their first practice match against New Zealand in Hyderabad, India, as the World Cup is set to kick off on October 5th this year. </textarea>
