                <textarea id="text" readonly> 14 Of The Unhealthiest Lean Cuisine Frozen Meals

When it comes to frozen meals that appear to be healthy, Lean Cuisine is king. The Nestl√©-owned brand has been supplying lower-calorie, lower-fat microwaveable meals to customers for over 40 years, and in that time it's racked up dozens of flavors to choose from. With a mission that seeks to supply nutritious meals at high speed, Lean Cuisine meals are designed to clock in at under 400 calories, with recipes created by dietitians in order to give you the best nutritional bang for your buck. Many of its meal options are also intended to cater to specific diets, with gluten-free and low-carb options, as well as meals verified by the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association as fitting in with their respective nutritional guidelines.

However, while many Lean Cuisine meals are undeniably healthier than some other frozen meal options available at the supermarket, some aren't as impressive as you might think. Lean Cuisine meals can be high in sodium or heavily processed, and can be heavily reliant on refined grains like white rice or pasta, which have little nutritional value. In this article, we selected unhealthier options in Lean Cuisine's range by highlighting its highest-sodium and highest-sugar offerings, as well as looking at choices that are low in fiber or protein, or appear to be overly processed. </textarea>
