                <textarea id="text" readonly> A “wholesome” interaction has gone viral after xQc reduced a fan to tears after gifting him an early Christmas present.

Ever since Omegle’s reign over the internet ended, streamers have been using Monkey Chat to interact with strangers.

Namely, xQc has been live-streaming his time on the app via Kick, though more often than not, the conversations have ended in insults being exchanged.

Now, however, a “wholesome” moment has gone viral after a young fan asked the popular streamer for an early Christmas present — and his wish was granted.

Stumbling onto xQc while on the app with a friend, the boy instantly recognized the “big ass streamer,” taking the opportunity to grab a photo as proof of the interaction.

The boy then asked if he could be gifted a “PC for Christmas,” to which xQc said, “If you show me around and you’re broke, I’ll actually get you one.”

“I swear to God, on my life, I’m not just begging for one ‘cause I just want to be on YouTube,” the boy said, revealing he had hopes of becoming a streamer himself. This was evidently enough to convince xQc, who sent the boy enough money for PC.
