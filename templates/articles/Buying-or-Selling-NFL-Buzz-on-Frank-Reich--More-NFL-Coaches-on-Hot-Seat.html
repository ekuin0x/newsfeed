Matt Eberflus willingly inherited a rebuild with the Chicago Bears. From a roster perspective, the team has done—certainly not a perfect, but—a reasonably good job of navigating it.

"I don't sense much friction in Chicago," ESPN's Jeremy Fowler said. "Still, that record could be tough to overcome.

The on-field results are indeed a different story.

Given the roster transition, you'd expect a struggle at times. Is the team actually progressing, though? It's hard to believe yes when Chicago's best performances only happen opposite the NFL's worst teams. Collapsing against the Detroit Lions doesn't help, either.

"It's becoming increasingly difficult to make a case for why he will remain in his position in 2024," Brad Biggs of the Chicago Tribune said.

During his time in charge, the Bears are 6-22 and haven't won consecutive games. They're still not sure if Justin Fields is the future at quarterback, and if Chicago ends in position to draft Caleb Williams or Drake Maye, can the current staff be trusted to develop him anyway?

I'm not a decision-maker for Chicago, but that answer is no. </textarea>
