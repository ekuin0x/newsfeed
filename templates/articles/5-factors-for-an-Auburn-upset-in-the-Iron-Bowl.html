                <textarea id="text" readonly> As has often been the case recently, the Tigers are playing the role of spoiler against an Alabama team with championship aspirations.

Hoping to close Hugh Freeze’s first season on a high note with an upset of its arch rival, Auburn (6-5, 3-4 SEC) hosts No. 8 Alabama (10-1, 7-0 SEC) in the 88th edition of the Iron Bowl. The Tigers are closing at around 14.5-point underdogs — though it was just two years ago they were three-touchdown underdogs at home and took Alabama to four overtimes.

Can Auburn find some classic Jordan-Hare Stadium magic? Or are the Crimson Tide rolling too much with a nine-game winning streak? Here are five factors for an Auburn win, Iron Bowl edition. Keep it locked at Auburn Undercover for our pregame notebook, live game updates, instant analysis after the clock hits zero, and tons of content to follow Saturday night and into Sunday. You won't want to miss out.

1. Make Milroe work from the pocket: Last Saturday wasn’t exactly an encouraging warmup for Auburn’s defense against a mobile, dynamic quarterback.

New Mexico State’s Diego Pavia threw three touchdowns, but greater than that, he was a complete game-changer against the Auburn defense with his ability to extend plays, give his receivers time to find openings in the defense, and generally beat Auburn in “every critical moment.” Next up is one of the best athletes in the country at the quarterback position.

Alabama’s offense seems to be better tailored to Jalen Milroe’s skill set as the season has progressed, and the result is a confident and dangerous QB. As Auburn has discussed all season when facing these kinds of dynamic passers is that containing the pocket is a must. Auburn’s pass rush has been steadily growing into a strong product — the New Mexico State game notwithstanding — and it has to give itself a chance to impact the game on Milroe as a passer, not a runner and playmaker.

Despite all its recent success, the Crimson Tide is still No. 12 in the SEC in sacks allowed this season. Its offensive line has become a punishing one in the ground game, but the pockets leave a bit to be desired. Any advantages that present themselves have to be taken advantage of by Jalen McLeod and crew to put Alabama behind the chains and get off the field. And when Milroe has to beat Auburn with his arm, the Tigers’ talented, senior-laden defensive backfield needs to be ready to prove its worth in what should be exciting one-on-one matchups between players like Jermaine Burton and D.J. James.

2. Don’t let Alabama’s front dominate: The talent level and game-controlling ability of Alabama’s front line is on par with others that have given the Tigers major trouble this season.

Particularly in road games against Texas A&M and LSU, Auburn felt like it sometimes couldn’t even get off the ground on offense because of how its offensive line was being blown up at the point of attack. The Tigers have found themselves in much stronger places since then, and their offense looked to be clicking as a unit during the three-game winning streak.

But a perfect storm rolled back in against New Mexico State, as not only was Auburn unable to get much push up front, but its penalty issues reared back up, routinely putting the Tigers behind schedule on first or second down.

It’s probably too much to ask Auburn to neutralize destructive members of Alabama’s defensive front like Dallas Turner and Chris Braswell. But it can’t be a disastrous pocket for Payton Thorne or a clogged frontline for Jarquez Hunter. Auburn is already coming off the New Mexico State loss where it faced an average third-down distance of 9.7 yards. Anything comparable against the Crimson Tide is going to make for an even steeper climb toward an upset.

3. Restart turnover streak: Auburn’s streak of 18 straight games forcing a turnover fittingly came to an end last weekend in the team’s worst defensive performance — relative to the opponent, of course — of the season.

The turnover battle is always important in any game, but with the uphill battle Auburn is fighting against Alabama at a number of other positions, bolstering field position and momentum with at least one takeaway feels almost necessary for the Tigers to have a chance here. Remember that the last time Auburn was a double-digit underdog at home this season, it scored 14 points off two turnovers to hang with No. 1 Georgia.

And even after last weekend’s debacle, Auburn is still tied for first in the SEC with 17 takeaways on the season. Alabama takes good care of the ball, with only 10 turnovers this year, but Milroe has also thrown a pick in three of his last five SEC games.

4. Take your shot: If there was ever a moment for Freeze to dig into his bag of tricks, this is probably it.

Nick Saban said this week that Freeze’s offensive tendencies and success in Alabama’s losses to those Ole Miss teams forced Saban to adjust some of his defensive philosophies. This year’s Auburn team is much different, of course, and at times has had a completely inept offensive approach and execution — or lack thereof.

Freeze had plenty of bad tape to attempt to reverse after the New Mexico State game, but the Tigers have still had their moments this season in terms of finding explosiveness. Calling back again to the Georgia game, Payton Thorne’s 67-yard run early on helped instill some confidence in the Tigers’ offense, even if they weren’t perfect that day.

An early play call for top pass-catcher Rivaldo Fairweather — who has four touchdowns over the past three games — or a few chunk runs to get Hunter into rhythm will be key early on to keep to the crowd engaged and keep a stout Alabama defense on its toes.

5. Find some ‘superpowers’: In Bryant-Denny Stadium, it always feels like an uphill battle for the Tigers from the get-go, whereas the home crowd imbues them with what Alabama players called "superpowers" this week.

But a crowd can only do so much. In the past three Iron Bowls in Jordan-Hare Stadium — 2017, 2019 and 2021 — Auburn seemed to always have an answer for Alabama's talent in the form of timely plays on both sides of the ball. At least in the past three meetings on the Plains, the Tigers have been the ones to make most of the key plays — for the most part, with the obvious exception of Bryce Young's game-tying and overtime-winning throws.

This year's team will certainly need that same prowess, since there aren't many favorable matchups for the Tigers in this game. Auburn is certainly at a talent disadvantage, but that's old news in this series by now. Getting an early touchdown, turnover or some sort of roar-inducing play is probably a necessity for Auburn to generate some energy and stay competitive.
