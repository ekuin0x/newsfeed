                <textarea id="text" readonly> Jean Knight, who was best known for her hit, "Mr. Big Stuff," has died. She was 80.

Family representative Mona Giamanco confirmed that Knight died at Tampa General Hospital last Wednesday.

"Jean Knight's legacy is not just a musical one; it is a testament to the enduring love between an artist, her hometown and the fans who adored her," Knight's family shared in a statement.

The Grammy-nominated singer, who was from New Orleans, was known as a musical powerhouse. Jean started her music career in her hometown shortly after high school before skyrocketing to fame with her 1971 song, "Mr. Big Stuff."

The song reached No. 1 on Billboard’s R&B chart and No. 2 on the Billboard 200 pop chart. The success of "Mr. Big Stuff" earned Knight a Grammy nomination for best female R&B vocal performance in 1972.

Following the success of the song, Knight went on to record several more albums, which included some of her other well-known songs, including "(Don’t Mess With) My Toot Toot" and "Bill."
