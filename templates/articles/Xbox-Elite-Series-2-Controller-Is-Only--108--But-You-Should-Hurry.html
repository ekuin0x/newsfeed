                <textarea id="text" readonly> The Xbox Elite Series 2 controller is on sale for only $108 at the Verizon Store. This is by far the best Black Friday/Cyber Monday deal we've seen on Microsoft's premium controller for Xbox consoles and PC. The Elite Series 2 retails for $180, and it hasn't been offered for less than $140 during the annual sales event. As such, we expect this to sell out pretty quickly. You don't need to be a Verizon subscriber to take advantage of this offer.

The Elite Series 2 offers the same great ergonomics as the standard Xbox Wireless Controller, but it has a better build quality, a textured grip, and some awesome customization features. Inside the box, you'll find four removable back paddles, an extra D-pad, and four additional analog stick caps that can be swapped on the fly. All of the extra components are neatly stored inside the included hardshell controller carrying case.

The Elite Series 2 also has trigger locks that reduce the pull length of RT and LT, which can be useful for certain types of games like first-person shooters.

Verizon is also beating major retailers on prices for two standard Xbox Wireless Controllers. The Robot White model is down to $36 (was $60), and the Pulse Red model is $39.

Verizon is far from the only retailer offering Xbox controller deals this weekend. Check out our roundup dedicated to Black Friday Xbox controller deals for a look at all the different models that are on sale and where to buy them.

For example, Target is offering the red Elite Series 2 Core controller for $96, down from $140. The Core has the same great feel as the standard Elite Series 2, but it doesn't come with swappable components. You can buy them separately, however, and you can get some good back paddles for pretty cheap.
