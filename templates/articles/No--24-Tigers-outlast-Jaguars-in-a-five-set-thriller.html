Speaking of career bests, Barrett tied hers with five aces, Zimmerman set a new mark herself with four,piled up a career-high 29 digs andstepped in to record a career-best 10.However, a handful of errors both attacking and from the service line proved too much to overcome for the Tigers as the Jaguars tied the match at one set apiece.Senior setterhad the offense purring in the third set.

Barrett kept things going from the service line, dialing up a six-point run, giving her team all the momentum they needed.Once Auburn sided out,andpicked up where Barrett left off. Blocks from Kemp and Scheer gave's squad even more energy. Lead in hand, the Tigers weren't giving it back.Even when South Alabama crept within one, 24-23, Zimmerman served up one of the coldest aces in 2023.Crouch was 6-3 in five-setters last year. This edition of the Tigers weren't about to ruin that reputation.Zimmerman and Harmon kicked off the set with a thunderous block and each, along with Barrett, would keep things rolling at the service line.Barrett directed an offense that hit .326 in the final stanza, which included four kills from Anderson. When the dust settled, Auburn left no doubt in the fifth, securing the set 15-8 and extending the team's record to 8-1."No, they don't like to lose. We were a little uneven tonight, we didn't play great. Akasha [Anderson] was back from illness and looked a little off for the early parts of the match. When she settled down and started getting a bunch of kills, that coincided with us doing better."The thing that really kept us in it, because we were struggling in a lot of the facets of the game, was serving. We ended up with 14 aces and a lot in that fourth-set turnaround. We work on serving so much, and we're becoming a good serving team. I think Bel [Zimmerman] has the capability of being one of the best servers in the country. She's already one of the best in the conference."Chelsey [Harmon] came in off the bench and I thought she did a great job bringing a lot of energy. Bel has been showing us that she's a good left-side attacker. We put her back on the right now that Akasha was back but her numbers have been so good on the left. Madison [Scheer] had struggled a bit so we flipped them and that seemed to help."It's a quick turnaround for the Tigers as the Alabama Showdown continues in Mobile on Friday, Sept. 15 when Auburn takes on UAB at 2:30 p.m. CT. The Orange and Blue will round out the tournament against Samford on Saturday, Sept. 16 against Samford at Noon CT. </textarea>
