                <textarea id="text" readonly> The day after Thanksgiving kicks off a series of marketing campaigns to get people to begin their holiday shopping, whether for others or for themselves. Black Friday is the biggest and busiest shopping day in the US, but the day that online shoppers wait for is Cyber Monday.

Cyber Monday this year officially begins on Nov. 27, and the start time varies from store to store. However, in recent years, there has been a shift to online shopping, which has caused shopping holidays to overlap.

What is Cyber Monday?

Cyber Monday is a marketing term used to describe the Monday following Thanksgiving Day. It’s considered one of the busiest online shopping days of the year.

Unlike Black Friday, which historically involves in-store shopping with doorbuster deals, Cyber Monday is centered around online shopping. Many retailers both large and small offer discounts and promotions on their websites, encouraging consumers to shop online.

They often launch campaigns specifically for the day, promoting online-exclusive deals and limited-time offers through email newsletters, social media promotions, and online advertisements.

These deals include a wide range of products, from electronics and gadgets to clothing, home goods, and more.

Despite mounting financial pressures, holiday shoppers say they are planning to shell out more money on Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales this year than last. https://t.co/AGtmjD8bgt — CBS News (@CBSNews) November 25, 2023

Cyber Monday attracts online shoppers and gadget lovers

Cyber Monday appeals to consumers who prefer the convenience of online shopping and may want to avoid the crowds associated with traditional Black Friday in-store shopping.

The day has become particularly popular for deals on technology and electronics, including smartphones, laptops, tablets, and other gadgets. Consumers often look for tech-related bargains during this online shopping event. </textarea>
