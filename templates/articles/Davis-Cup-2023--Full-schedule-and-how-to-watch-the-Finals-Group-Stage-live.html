                <textarea id="text" readonly> The 2023 Davis Cup Finals Group Stage will take place from 12 to 17 September in four cities across Europe.

The top two teams from the four groups of four will advance to the final of the premier international team event in men's tennis, set to take place in November in Malaga, Spain. Eight nations will compete in the final.

Group A: Canada, Chile, Italy, Sweden

In Group A, defending champions Canada will face Italy, Sweden and Chile at Unipol Arena in Bologna, Italy. The Canadian team will be without Felix Auger-Aliassime. Therefore, much will depend on Denis Shapovalov as they take on a strong Italian side, featuring three players ranked in the Top 40: Jannik Sinner, Lorenzo Musetti and Matteo Berrettini. The Italians will be eager to get revenge for their semi-final loss to Canada last year.

Sweden’s Elias Ymer is another player to watch out for. He tends to perform well in the Davis Cup, having won six of his last eight matches in singles. Leo Borg, the son of 11-time Grand Slam champion, Bjorn Borg, is set to play his first match for Sweden after missing the match against Bosnia and Herzegovina in his maiden call-up.

Nicolás Jarry of Chile recently reached a career-high world ranking of 29 after claiming two titles on the ATP Tour this year, and the South Americans will hope to cause an upset in the group. </textarea>
