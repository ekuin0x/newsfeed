                <textarea id="text" readonly> The Bachelor star Ben Flajnik is a married man.

On Saturday, the winemaker, 41, posted a gushing tribute to his new bride on Instagram as he revealed that they secretly wed last month.

Dressed in a black suit with a silver tie, his gorgeous blonde wife, whom he did not name, looked gorgeous in her wedding gown as they beamed with happiness.

'Last month, in an intimate ceremony surrounded by family I married my best friend and it was the most incredible day of my life,' his caption began.

'Tears and laughs were had and I've never felt so present with another person in my life. I'm so grateful to do life with you and thank you for your unwavering love and support,' he added.

Married man: The Bachelor and The Bachelorette alum Ben Flajnik is a married man. The winemaker, 41, posted a gushing tribute to his new bride on Instagram, revealing that he married her last month

The couple got married at Mission San Francisco Solano, in Sonoma State Historic Park in Sonoma, California

Several members of Bachelor Nation shared well their wishes. 'Congrats!!!' J.P. Rosenbaum commented while Ashley Iaconetti wrote, 'Congratulations!!!'

Flajnik entered Bachelor Nation during Ashley Hebert's season of The Bachelorette in 2011.

He was the runner-up on that season (to Rosenbaum) and was asked to back for season 16 of The Bachelor and got engaged to Courtney Robertson at the end of the season.

The two broke up less than a year later in October 2012.

The Ion Wines founder also dated Stephanie Winn for three years from 2014 to 2017 after matching on Tinder.

However, in 2021, the Sonoma, California resident told Us Weekly that he was back on the dating apps.

'I sporadically go on Hinge every once in a while, so yeah, I suppose I'm on the apps. I live in Sonoma now, which is a fairly small town and that makes dating fairly difficult,' he said.

'If I go on a bunch of first dates in the town of Sonoma then everyone probably just assumes I'm back being the Bachelor, which is not the case.'

Gushing tribute: 'Last month, in an intimate ceremony surrounded by family I married my best friend and it was the most incredible day of my life,' his caption began. 'Tears and laughs were had and I've never felt so present with another person in my life. I'm so grateful to do life with you and thank you for your unwavering love and support,' he added

Former couple: He ultimately chose Courtney Robertson during his season of The Bachelor; seen in 2012

Breakup: Ben and Courtney broke up less than a year later in October 2012 (seen in 2011 on The Bachelor)

Runner up: Ben was the runner up during Ashely Hebert's season of The Bachelorette

BiP: He was also asked to be on Bachelor in Paradise five times and turned it down time after time

He was also asked to be on Bachelor in Paradise five times and turned it down time after time.

'They’ve asked me to do it, like, five times,' he told Us Weekly, adding that it would take 'a lot' for him to return to any of the Bachelor shows.

'My handler at the time, Adam Mansfield, is now working on that show, so he always reaches out and I’m just too busy. I have too many projects and companies and I’m too old.'

And, now, he has a new wife who he didn't meet on a reality television show. </textarea>
