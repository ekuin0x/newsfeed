                <textarea id="text" readonly> Dominik Szoboszlai's brace fired RB Leipzig to victory over VfB Stuttgart and to within a point of Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich.

RB Leipzig 2-1 VfB Stuttgart

Goals: 1-0 Szoboszlai 25', 2-0 Szoboszlai 49' (assist: Silva), 2-1 Führich (pen. 68')

There was an early scare for in-form Leipzig as Thomas Kastanaras forced a strong diving save from Janis Blaswich after being played in by Wataru Endo. Wrestling back the initiative, Leipzig created their first meaningful opening through David Raum, whose teasing cross was headed over by Andre Silva. Szoboszlai made no mistake with their next attempt, the Hungarian thundering a swerving free-kick beyond Florian Müller's despairing dive from fully 35 yards. Raum and Silva combined twice in quick succession soon after, with the Leipzig striker heading against the outside of the near post and sending another attempt straight at the goalkeeper.

Stuttgart squandered a glorious opening to level at the start of the second half, when Nikolas Nartey shot wide with only Blaswich to beat. Szoboszlai proceeded to show the visitors how it's done with an arrowed finish into the bottom corner from just outside the area. Stuttgart's Luca Pfeiffer sent a free header over, before Silva followed suit at the other end. Chris Führich gave VfB a lifeline when he converted a penalty following a lengthy VAR decision for a handball against Josko Gvardiol, but Leipzig had no trouble seeing out a deserved win that keeps the pressure on Bayern - who play Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday - and extends their unbeaten run to 16 competitive matches.

Match stats

Leipzig are on an 11-match unbeaten run in the Bundesliga, winning eight.

After seven assists across his last eight Bundesliga games, Szoboszlai scored his second and third goals of the campaign. Stuttgart are the Leipzig No.17's favourite opponent (four goals - two braces - in three appearances).

Die Roten Bullen are unbeaten against Stuttgart in 10 Bundesliga meetings to date (W8, D2).

Some 24 of the last 25 penalties Leipzig have conceded have been scored, including each of the last 14.

Stuttgart are 19 away matches without a win in the Bundesliga.

VfB's Sudan-born Australian forward Alou Kuol, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Bundesliga 2 club Sandhausen, made his Bundesliga debut.
