                <textarea id="text" readonly> Viewers have bashed one of Netflix's latest Christmas releases, labelling it the worst festive film ever - even though it has a star studded cast.

To rub salt in the wound, the film now available on the streaming platform, has bagged an abysmal Rotten Tomato score of 33 per cent.

The Best Christmas Ever! sees mother-of-two Charlotte (Heather Graham) arrive uninvited at her ex-best-friend, Jackie's (Brandy Norwood) home in a bid to discover if her braggadocios annual festive newsletters are in fact true.

But Charlotte is taken aback when she discovers her former friend's seemingly perfect life.

Charlotte ends up spending the festive holidays with her former friend's family alongside her husband Rob (Jason Biggs) and children Dora (Abby Villasmil) and Grant (Wyatt Hunt)

'Abysmal': To rub salt in the wound, the film now available on the streaming platform, has bagged an abysmal Rotten Tomato score of 33 per cent

Despite witnessing first hand Jackie's life is all real, Charlotte is not convinced.

She is envious of Jackie who has a 10-year-old daughter attending Harvard, a son aiding a humanitarian crisis in Africa, as well as a stunning husband named Valentino (Matt Cede√±o).

In a bid to poke holes in her former friend's life, the mother-of-two searches around the Jenning's family home.

She is also on the pursuit of a letter her husband sent Jackie, as the two had previously dated in college.

Everything soon reaches boiling point when Charlotte accidentally damages a doll house Jackie has been building over the course of a few months.

The family later bring up Charlotte's latest actions, with Rob pointing out that she is only trying to find something wrong with Jackie's life because she is so unhappy with her own.

After admitting she was trying to find the letter, Rob confesses it was a festive newsletter he had been sending to various people annually.

He had not told his wife about the Christmas letters because he knew how much she despises them.

Slated: Fans were not happy with the festive film, with some telling Netflix they should be 'ashamed' of themselves, and others saying they would rather 'poke their eyes out'

Driving back to her home, Charlotte is stopped by a woman dressed as an angel telling her to spend the festive season with Jackie, adding 'she loves company, especially around this time of year'.

Shortly thereafter the mother-of-two drives past a sign with Jackie's son's name, which reads: 'Daniel Jennings memorial fund'.

Realising Jackie's son David was not in Africa but had in fact passed away, Charlotte rushes back to Jackie's house.

A bereaved Jackie explains she couldn't bear to write about Daniel's death, so instead she wrote about as if Daniel had created the foundation in a bid to keep his memory alive.

Despite the film's plot being seemingly heart-warming, some fans are still going as far as to call it the 'worst movie of all time'.

Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, one fan wrote: 'Best. Christmas. Ever! could possibly be the worst Christmas movie ever'

'Best. Christmas. Ever! on Netflix is the..Worst. Film. Ever,' a second said.

'Avoid or even better, poke your eyes out. That's far more enjoyable than putting yourself through this waste of 1.5hrs.'

Another chimed in: 'Netflix's Best Christmas Ever is the worst movie I've ever watched.. you guys should be ashamed for airing this'

'Best Christmas ever' on @netflix may simply be the absolute worst Christmas movie I have ever suffered through,' stated one user </textarea>
