                <textarea id="text" readonly> Borussia Dortmund’s Karim Adeyemi speaks out on the criticism of his performances by Brian Szlenk Straub

Borussia Dortmund reportedly had the opportunity to sign Granit Xhaka and Victor Boniface, but turned down moves for the duo for different reasons.

Granit Xhaka made a stunning return to the Bundesliga this summer, joining Bayer Leverkusen from Arsenal for a fee of around 15 million euros. The Switzerland international has slotted into the Leverkusen midfield seamlessly, and is playing a key role in their title charge. But he could have joined Borussia Dortmund if the latest reports are to be believed.

According to SportBILD, Borussia Dortmund were offered the chance to sign Xhaka. But those in charge at the club decided that the overall package of around 50 million euros to sign the 31 year old was too expensive, especially considering that he wouldn’t have any resale value. So they turned down the opportunity to sign him.

Borussia Dortmund ended up bolstering their midfield with the signings of Felix Nmecha and Marcel Sabitzer. Although they haven’t enjoyed the best of starts to life in BVB colours.

The magazine adds Victor Boniface was also offered to the Black and Yellows in spring, when he was still playing for Belgian side Royale Union Saint-Gilloise. But the BVB bosses felt at that point that they did not need a new striker. And so they decided against pursuing a move for him.

Boniface ended up joining Bayer Leverkusen, where he has made a stellar start and has scored nine goals in ten appearances across all competitions.

Borussia Dortmund’s opinion over needing a new striker changed towards the end of the summer transfer window. They ultimately decided to sign Niclas Füllkrug from Werder Bremen, and he has since taken over as their first-choice striker. </textarea>
