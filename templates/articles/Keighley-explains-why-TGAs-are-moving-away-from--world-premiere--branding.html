                <textarea id="text" readonly> The Game Awards host and producer Geoff Keighley has revealed that this year’s show is moving away from its familiar ‘world premiere’ branding.

Speaking during a Twitch Q&A on Sunday, Keighley explained that for this year’s show, the organisers wanted all of its game reveals, whether they’re game announcements or first looks, to be able to stand side-by-side at the event.

Asked by a viewer about the number of ‘world premieres’ the public should expect from The Game Awards 2023, Keighley replied: “I don’t know [if there will be the same amount]. I haven’t counted, honestly. I think around the same, but I don’t know… also, what is a world premiere?

“Actually, you’ll see this year, we often put up those cards, ‘world premiere, world premiere’… we’re kind of moving away from that, just because everything’s kind of, ‘is it a first look? Is it an announcement?’ etc. So we just treat it all as great game content.”

The host and producer said viewers should expect a similar runtime and amount of content to previous years.

“I don’t want to quote a number, because then it’s going to reverberate on the internet… but it’s probably similar to past years in terms of the length of the show and content,” Keighley said.

“We went a little bit shorter last year, or we tried to, but then Chris Judge took his sweet time with his speech. It’s probably going to be similar to last year with a little bit shorter show.”

The Game Awards will be streamed live from the Peacock Theatre in Los Angeles on Thursday, December 7.

There are 31 awards up for grabs in total at this year’s Game Awards, with the winners set to be determined by a blended vote between the voting jury comprised of global media publications (90%) – which includes VGC – and public fan voting (10%).

In the same Twitch Q&A on Sunday, Geoff Keighley revealed he’s been considering other awards to add to the show, including Best Remake and Best Supporting Actor. He also claimed security will be tightened at this year’s show to prevent another stage invasion. </textarea>
