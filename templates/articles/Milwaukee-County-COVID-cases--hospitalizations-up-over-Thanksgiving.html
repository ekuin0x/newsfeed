                <textarea id="text" readonly> Milwauke County is seeing an uptick in both COVID-19 numbers and related hospitalizations.

Chief Health Policy Advisor for Milwaukee County Dr. Ben Weston posted on X on Monday, Nov. 27 that there has been a big jump in COVID-19 cases over the Thanksgiving holiday.

Weston said Milwaukee County is seeing its highest COVID-19 positivity rates in nearly two years – and highest hospitalizations in nearly one year. But Weston also noted it's too early to make a connection in COVID-19 numbers to the holiday.

His post noted that less than one-third of Milwaukee County residents 65+ years old have received the updated fall vaccine. He is urging everyone to reach out to family and friends.

"It’s not nearly enough for a population that is at such high risk of getting sick with COVID," Weston said. "Really, we need 100% of 65 and older to have gotten this COVID vaccine. And we’re not there yet."

He said he is not worried as much about current case numbers as he is with the safety of at-risk individuals.

"We haven’t seen levels like that for a year," Weston said. "By no means do I think we’re going back to the beginning of omicron with overwhelmed hospitals or anything like that, but for folks who are vulnerable, folks who are immuno-compromised, people who are over 65 years old, this is something to take note of. "

The Hayat Pharmacy on Layton is seeing more positive COVID-19 tests too.

"For two or three weeks, there was a time when we didn’t get a single positive test, but in the last two weeks, we are getting about one or two positive tests a day," founder Hashim Zaibak said.

The county's percentage of positive tests has been trending up for the past four weeks from around 9% to about 20%.

Zaibak said the rising numbers are leading more people to getting vaccinated, but the number of vaccinations could be higher.

"People sometimes get nervous anytime they hear a friend or coworker or relative who tests positive, then they start thinking about getting the vaccine, because people get busy," Zaibak said. "It’s not that they’re anti-vax or anything, they just get busy."
