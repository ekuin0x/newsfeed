                <textarea id="text" readonly> Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder Sebastian Rode and VfB Stuttgart striker Silas both netted as the sides drew a keenly contested encounter 1-1.

Eintracht Frankfurt 1-1 VfB Stuttgart

Goals: 1-0 Rode 55’, 1-1 Silas 75’ (assist: Haraguchi)

There was a tentative start in Frankfurt with neither side in particularly confident mood after no wins in their past two matches. Stuttgart had performed well in defeat to Bayern Munich last weekend though and impressed by edging possession and winning most challenges in a battling opening 30 minutes. A mazy burst upfield by Randal Kolo Muani and one-two with Rafael Borre gave the home fans something to cheer, even if no opportunity resulted. Stuttgart threatened to tear their way through the hosts’ defence on the break, with Tiago Tomas finding Gil Dias only for a defensive block to thwart the opening. Juan Jose Perea had a shot shortly before the break but snatched at it with Makoto Hasebe bearing down on him. That summed up a first half dominated by the two defences.

Frankfurt registered their best shot of the game within seconds of the restart, with Philipp Max bursting to the edge of the box but dragging wide. The hosts turned up the tempo somewhat and were rewarded with Rode looping the ball over Fabian Bredlow for the opening goal. Stuttgart, who have struggled to turn spirited performances into points recently, looked deflated after conceding. Max swiped another effort just wide, and Kolo Muani blazed over for the rejuvenated hosts. Frankfurt’s failure to add a second would haunt them though, as Silas stroked Stuttgart level after receiving a neat Haraguchi through-ball on the break. Silas and fellow Stuttgart substitute Enzo Millot both had chances to win it in a frenetic closing phase, and the visitors must be the happier side with the point that lifts them clear of the bottom two for now.
