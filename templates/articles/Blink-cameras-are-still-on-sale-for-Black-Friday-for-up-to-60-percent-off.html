Black Friday might have come and gone, but if you’re looking to protect your home, Blink security cameras remain on sale, with some of the company’s products as much as 60 percent off ahead of Cyber Monday. The highlight of this weekend’s promotion is the Blink Mini , which is discounted to a modest $20. Although that price doesn’t represent a new all-time low for Blink’s diminutive security camera, it’s still a good deal at 43 percent off its $35 MSRP and only about $3 more expensive than Engadget has seen it fall to during some past sales.

The Blink Mini is best suited for monitoring areas inside your home. It offers 1080p video capture and two-way audio, allowing you to communicate with other people and pets using the Blink mobile app. The camera can also send real-time alerts to your phone whenever it detects motion. Like other Blink devices, the Mini comes with a free 30-day trial to Blink’s subscription plan. The service allows users to save clips to the cloud and stream up to 90 minutes of live footage in one sitting. Also included in the box are a mounting kit, USB cable and power adapter.

Another deal worth considering is the Blink Outdoor system with solar panel charging mounts. This package bundles together three third-generation Blink Outdoor cameras. Normally the entire kit costs about $425, but after a 60 percent discount, it’s down to $169.96. The included solar panel charging mounts greatly simplify installation since you don’t need to worry about wiring or batteries like with some other outdoor camera systems. Additionally, the third-generation model is water-resistant and rated to work in environments as cold as -4 degrees fahrenheit. The built-in 1080p camera features a 110-degree field of view. Although Amazon offers a newer outdoor model, the three-pack kit is still a compelling package, particularly when it’s nearly $255 off.
