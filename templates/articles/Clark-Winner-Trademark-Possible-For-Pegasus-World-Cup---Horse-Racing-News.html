                <textarea id="text" readonly> Upstart gelding Trademark, outside, under Fernando De La Cruz, furiously battles favorite First Mission before winning the Clark (G2) by a nose

BBN Racing's Trademark tied his career best Brisnet Speed Rating of 103 with his nose victory over favorite First Mission in Friday's 149th running of the Clark (G2) at Churchill Downs.

“I've always wanted to win the Clark, but we always had fillies in our barn,” trainer Vicki Oliver said. “Now, we have a lot of colts and it's really fun to win a race like this.”

Trademark, who collected his first graded stakes win and became racing's newest millionaire, clocked 1 1/8 miles on a fast track in 1:49.95 under jockey Fernando De La Cruz and earned his second win from nine starts this year.

Oliver said the $3-million Pegasus World Cup (G1) Jan. 27 at Gulfstream Park is a possible target for Trademark's next start.

A 4-year-old Upstart gelding, Trademark has run some of his best efforts at Churchill Downs. Three starts ago in the Lukas Classic (G2), Trademark also earned a 103 Brisnet Speed Rating for his runner-up finish to Clapton. He closed his 2022 season with a four-length win in the Commonwealth Turf when the race was moved from the turf to a sloppy (sealed) main track at the Louisville oval.

Trademark has 6-3-1 record from 22 career starts and $1,055,865 in purse earnings. </textarea>
