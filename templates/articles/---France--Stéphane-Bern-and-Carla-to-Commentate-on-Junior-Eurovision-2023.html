                <textarea id="text" readonly> Stéphane Bern and Carla will once again return to commentate on the Junior Eurovision Song Contest for France.

France Télévisions has revealed in a press conference that Stéphane Bern and Carla will commentate on the Junior Eurovision Song Contest live on France 2. Stéphane is no stranger to commentating on Eurovision events, as he has provided commentary for the Eurovision Song Contest in 2010 and from 2015 to date, as well as Junior Eurovision annually since 2018.

France’s Junior Eurovision 2019 entrant Carla joins Stéphane in the commentary box for a third time. Carla previously commented on the contest in 2020 and 2022 contests when France took victory in both editions.

Zoé Clauzure is set to represent France on home soil in Junior Eurovision 2023 with ‘Cœur’ (translation: ‘Heart’) which is a fun pop song “full of pep” but will also displays Zoe’s full range of vocals on stage.

Title France returned to the contest in 2018 following a 14 year break, and were represented by Angélina and her song “Jamais Sans Toi”. Since their return France has gone on to win both the 2020 and 2022 editions of the competition. Prior to 2018 year, they only participated in the 2004 contest in Lillehammer, Norway. Thomas Pontier placed 6th with his song “Si on voulait bien”. </textarea>
