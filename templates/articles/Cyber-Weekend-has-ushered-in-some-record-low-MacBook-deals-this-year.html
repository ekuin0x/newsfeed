It's no secret that Apple MacBooks aren't the cheapest laptops out there — especially with the release of the $7,199-plus MacBook Pro.

While that particular model hasn't gone on sale just yet, plenty of other Cyber Weekend MacBook deals are live across the web — including a good portion of the latest M3 line. Most configurations of the 15-inch MacBook Air that came out in early 2023 are also on sale for at least $250 off. And if you're looking for the biggest bargain, the Mashable Choice Award-winning M1 model from 2020 is sitting at its lowest price to date. (Amazon gives you the option of bundling it with three years' worth of Apple Care+ at a discount, too.)

We've rounded up the best MacBook deals (plus a few Mac mini markdowns) below. Check back often, as we'll be updating our list of picks consistently as we head into Cyber Weekend.

Note: All newly added deals are marked with a ✨. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.

Mac and MacBook deals

Why we like it

The M3 lineup of Macs and MacBooks was announced just a few weeks ago, and at $150 off, this is the entry-level M3 model's lowest price to date. (You can technically get it for even cheaper if you're a paid member of the My Best Buy program, but $1,449 is the all-time low for the general public.) With this MacBook's upgrades, you can expect lightning-fast speeds, a spacious 14 inches of display that doesn't come with a $2,000-plus premium, and finally, no touchbar. If you're into an even higher-powered machine, you'll also find the 14-inch and 16-inch M3 Pro MacBook Pros on sale.

The 15-inch MacBook Air's M2 processor can power you through everyday tasks and multimedia editing with ease — and it gives you the proper display space to actually do it. Its long-lasting battery life doesn't hurt either. Though it's not quite as light and portable as the rest of the Air line, it's an exceptional upgrade pick that doesn't quite reach the $2,000-plus heights of the Pro line. Grab it on sale at Best Buy, where paid My Best Buy members can take an additional $50 off its sale price of $1,049 (which Amazon matched at the time of writing).

If you're looking for a zippy work-from-home machine or the perfect school companion, look no further. Though Apple did just release the new M3 chip to its iMac and MacBook lineup, the M2 is still plenty powerful. You'll also get 13.6 inches of display (as opposed to the 13.3 inches of the previous-gen Air), a near-perfect keyboard, and best of all, this laptop is sitting at its lowest price ever with a paid My Best Buy membership.
