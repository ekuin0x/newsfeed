                <textarea id="text" readonly> Lanky and lightly bearded, Jihad Imtoor is the proud son of a fighter killed in the first intifada, or uprising, against Israel. His father was a member of Fatah, the political faction that controls the Palestinian Authority. But he has had enough of its rule in the West Bank.

On a recent day, Mr. Imtoor, 32, a small-business owner, stood outside his shop, watching a march for the many Palestinians detained in Israeli jails, whom Hamas says it is trying to free as part of a deal for a cease-fire in Gaza.

“I’m not Hamas, but I hope it comes here,” he said. “The P.A. has taken a lot from us, and it’s time for them to go.”

Referring to the monument in the center of Ramallah, he said: “The P.A. is working fine to protect the four lions on Manara Square, but they cannot protect the people from Israel.” </textarea>
