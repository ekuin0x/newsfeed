Teyana Taylor is upset that the details of her divorce from Iman Shumpert were made public.

The singer-songwriter secretly filed to end her marriage in January; however, the pair’s divorce details didn’t make headlines until earlier this week.

In the court documents obtained Wednesday by TMZ, Taylor, 32, accused the former NBA player, 33, of “treating her cruelly and displaying extreme narcissistic behavior throughout the majority of their marriage.”

She took to her Instagram Story Friday to address the split, writing, “I mind my business, don’t bother nobody & y’all know I’ve never played about my children, family & our privacy.

“I have not spoken on this private matter to any media outlets or blogs etc.,” she added, “So everyone claiming ‘Teyana said’ didn’t get any statements directly from ME. These statements were taken from private court documents that were leaked to the public.”

Taylor called it “very heartbreaking that someone would take out the time to make such a private matter public for the world to see.”

The dancer-choreographer made sure to note that “protecting [her] family is one thing [she’s] ALWAYS done” and “will continue to do” for the sake of her daughters — Junie, 7, and Rue, 3 — whom she shares with Shumpert.

She asked for “some privacy to resolve this matter in peace” and signed off, “Love y’all.”

Taylor — who wed the retired athlete in October 2016 — explained in her divorce petition that she decided to pull the plug because she was “unable to handle the emotional rollercoaster” of her relationship with Shumpert.

She also claimed she received “condescending and manipulative” messages from him about her career.

As he “became more and more angry,” Taylor said she even “began to intentionally dim her light for her husband to try to have a harmonious and peaceful marriage.”

The actress further alleged that Shumpert would get annoyed whenever they attended public events together and photographers would ask him to step aside to take solo shots of her.

She also claimed she turned down several job opportunities because he “did not want her to work,” adding that he grew more and more “insecure” as his NBA career “continued to wind down.”

Taylor — who said she started the divorce process in 2021 — claimed she tried to salvage her marriage while living in an “extremely” abusive environment.

She also accused Shumpert of cheating on her several times and is asking for full custody of their children. </textarea>
