                <textarea id="text" readonly> Princess Anne was reportedly instrumental in kicking Meghan Markle and Prince Harry out of Frogmore Cottage earlier this year.

According to Omid Scobie’s new book “Endgame,” obtained by Page Six ahead of its publication next week, the Princess Royal, 73, was “at the forefront of the supporters of the firm approach” taken by Buckingham Palace to boot the royal couple from the residence.

According to the explosive tome, an eviction notice was delivered to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex via Sir Michael John Stevens, the Keeper of the Privy Purse.

Harry, 39, and Markle, 42, moved to Montecito, Calif in 2020 and had used Frogmore as their U.K. residence when they would return on visits to Britain.

However, Stevens was tasked with telling the couple that they had to give back the cottage as they were no longer senior working royals.

The Invictus Games founder allegedly angrily called up his father King Charles soon after and shot back: “You don’t want to see your grandchildren anymore?”

The pair are parents to son, Archie, 4, and Lilibet, 2.

Prior to their dramatic departure from Britain, dubbed “Megxit,” Harry and Markle had spent over $3 million renovating the property.

News that they had to vacate the premises came in late February, just under two months after Harry dropped his tell-all “Spare.”

Charles reportedly began proceedings to boot Harry and Markle from the royal residence just one day after the book hit shelves on Jan. 10.

Harry’s disgraced uncle Prince Andrew was slated to take over Frogmore, despite him not wanting to leave his longtime home, the Royal Lodge.

The Duke of York, 63, has been adamant about staying at the luxurious 30-room lodge, where he has lived since 2002 with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson.

“This eviction surely spells the end of Harry and Meghan’s time in the U.K.,” a source told the US Sun at the time.

“Andrew is resisting the idea of moving into Frogmore Cottage after he was offered it last week,” they added. “But it shows Harry and Meghan are powerless to stop the eviction.”

Prince William and his wife, Kate Middleton, could be next in line to move into the Royal Lodge if Andrew leaves.

Harry and Meghan finally left four-bedroom Frogmore in June, shipping the last of their belongings to California. </textarea>
