                <textarea id="text" readonly> UPDATE: Nov. 26, 2023, 2:00 a.m. EST This post has been updated to include the latest TV deals from Walmart and competing retailers.

TV doorbusters during Cyber Monday are a given at several retailers during Cyber Week. While some nearly identical deals can be found at all of them, Walmart's Cyber Monday TV deals definitely speak the language of those who want to upgrade on a strict budget.

The $148 50-inch 4K TV from Walmart-owned brand onn. dropped during Walmart's first official Black Friday event of the year perfectly represents what you can expect to find when shopping for a TV at Walmart: the cheapest 4K TV possible at any given size between 50 inches and 70 inches.

Walmart had to come in hot after announcing its Black Friday schedule late â€” late compared to competitors like Best Buy and Samsung, who have been tagging countless TVs as Black Friday deals since Halloween.

The plan, which kicked off at 12 p.m. ET on Nov. 8 for Walmart+ members (and 3 p.m. ET for everyone else), saw another big drop on Wednesday, Nov. 22. Walmart+ members got early access to that one, too. Now, Cyber Monday deals are in full swing for everyone. We've been seeing TVs go in and out of stock at Walmart, so if you see a deal you want, snatch it up quickly.

Note: All newly added deals are marked with a âœ¨, while deals with a ðŸ”¥ have dropped to an all-time low price. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.

Best 50-inch TV deal

Why we like it

Just like Amazon's focus on its own Fire TVs during shopping events, Walmart is using Cyber Monday as an excuse to plug onn., its own brand of TVs. At less than $150, this 50-inch onn. TV is possibly the cheapest 50-inch TV you'll see all season â€” just compare that price to any other 50-inch TV deal live right now.

These ultra budget-friendly TVs aren't the brightest or the zippiest displays you could bring home, but reviews making up the nearly 5,000 five-star ratings note that the picture is solid for the price. Roku is also built-in.

Best 55-inch TV deal

Why we like it

Sometimes you don't need a super-fancy TV. This TCL model is a budget, no-frills 4K TV with Roku built-in. It's a great TV for the living room, bedroom, or kid's room.
