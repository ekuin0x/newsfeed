                <textarea id="text" readonly> Let's face it: Apple is undeniably the most popular tech brand on the planet. Unfortunately, though, all too often its price points make it hard to justify a purchase. Well, lucky for you, Amazon and Walmart have some incredible deals on all of your favorite Apple products this Black Friday.



We've found some serious savings (like, all-time low pricing) on things like AirPods, AirTags, iPads and even a gift card with purchase. As with all sales this time of year, prices often change without warning, and supplies are limited. So if you see something you like, it's a good idea to grab it now.



Best AirPod Black Friday deal

Best AirTag Black Friday deal

Apple Apple AirTag 4 Pack $80 $99 Save $19 Want to keep tabs on your purse, backpack, suitcase, wallet and other items? Just toss in an AirTag. These little locators rely on a global network of iPhones to help you pinpoint your stuff just about anywhere. These sell individually for $29, so a 4-pack for $87 is a decidedly solid deal. $80 at Amazon

Best Apple Watch Black Friday deals

Apple Apple Watch Series 8 [GPS 41mm] $299 $399 Save $100 Last year's Apple Watch is this year's Apple Watch bargain; the Series 8 packs plenty of power (including loads of health and safety features) but can be yours for a hefty $100 off the regular price. Note that this is the 41mm size in aluminum; other colors may be priced differently. $299 at Amazon

Apple Apple Watch Series 9 [GPS 41mm] $329 $399 Save $70 Not much has changed between the Apple Watch Series 8 and this year's Series 9, but with this sale they're only $50 apart — so maybe it's worth the extra splurge to get the latest and greatest? I'm an unabashed Apple Watch fan; to me it's the only logical smartwatch choice for iPhone owners. Note that this is the aluminum model with a 41mm screen; the larger one is priced higher, and other colors might be as well. $329 at Amazon

Best iPad Black Friday deals

Apple Apple 10.9-inch iPad (10th Generation) $399 $449 Save $50 Don't want to settle for an older iPad? The current-generation model packs in a slightly larger screen, faster processor, improved cameras and a USB-C charging port (buh-bye, Lightning!). It's also more aesthetically pleasing, having banished the Home button in favor of an edge-to-edge screen. The $399 sale price ties the lowest on record for this bestselling model. $399 at Walmart

Apple Apple 10.2-inch iPad, 256GB, (9th Generation) $350 $479 Save $129 Last year's iPad is this year's iPad bargain. Yes, it still has a rather chunky bezel and an old-school Home button, but under the hood it's all good: powerful processor, decent cameras, impressive battery life. It may be a long while (or never) before the current-gen iPad drops this low, so if you want a reasonable affordable Apple tablet, don't sleep on this deal. $350 at Amazon

Best MacBook Black Friday deal

Apple Apple MacBook Air Laptop (2023) $1,049 $1,299 Save $250 If your old MacBook is on its last legs, this is a good time to upgrade: Amazon's Black Friday deal knocks a hefty $200 off the price of a well-appointed MacBook Air — and it's a 2023 model to boot. Check out the ratings on this thing: 4.8 stars from nearly 900 buyers. It's no stretch to say you're likely to love this laptop. $1,049 at Amazon
