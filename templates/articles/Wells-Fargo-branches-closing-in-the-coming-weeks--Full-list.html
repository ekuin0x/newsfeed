                <textarea id="text" readonly> Wells Fargo and other banks continue to close branches across the country as banking habits change amid the rise of online banking .

“Customers use our wide range of digital capabilities for many of their banking needs and, as a result, more transactions are carried out outside the branch ,” a Wells Fargo spokesperson told Best Life in April.

“As such, we continually evaluate our branch network in light of changing customer needs, increased usage of digital banking and market factors,” the bank added.

In recent months, Wells Fargo has closed 61 branches. In September, the institution closed 25 locations, while another 15 shut down in October. As of November 18, they have closed an additional 21 branches and are expected to carry out four more closures next month.

List of Wells Fargo branches closing in the coming weeks

Upcoming bank closures must be reported to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) through an Advance Notice of Branch Closing. The notice must be given at least 90 days before the date on which a location plans to cease operation.

Each of the closures is documented in a weekly bulletin. Taking into account that the Advance Notice of Closing must be delivered 90 days in advance, the September newsletters include information on the Wells Fargo branches that would close in December.

The bulletins also contain information on effective closures, branch opening notices, as well as relocations.

According to OCC bulletins, Wells Fargo has shared advance notice of closing four branches, one each in California, Florida, Minnesota and Georgia. Here are the locations:

10011 WASHINGTON BOULEVARD, CULVER CITY, CA

199 NORTH OCEAN BOULEVARD, POMPANO BEACH, FL

615 N 7TH STREET, MINNEAPOLIS, MN

5703 WATERS AVENUE, SAVANNAH, GA

Although the number of closures expected in December is smaller compared to previous months, Wells Fargo plans to continue restructuring next year.

In the October bulletin, the advance notice of closure of 13 branches was shared, which would be effective at least 90 days later, that is, in January 2024. In the November bulletin, the bank has announced that it will shut down 13 more locations, with the closures taking effect in February. </textarea>
