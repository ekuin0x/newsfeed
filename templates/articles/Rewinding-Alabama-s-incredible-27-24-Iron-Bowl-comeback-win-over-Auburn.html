                <textarea id="text" readonly> The fiercest rivalry in the Southeastern Conference’s return is at hand. Alabama football travels to Auburn on Saturday for the renewal of the Iron Bowl at Jordan-Hare Stadium.

The Crimson Tide is entering Saturday’s matchup at 10-1 on the season, 7-0 in the SEC after beating Chattanooga in Tuscaloosa last week. UA faces Georgia next week in the SEC championship game but needs a win against Auburn to stay alive for the College Football Playoff.

Meanwhile, Auburn is Bowl eligible in Hugh Freeze’s first season in charge. However, the Tigers lost to New Mexico State at home last week.

The game is scheduled to kick off at 2:30 p.m. CT. It will be aired on CBS.

Auburn halftime analysis

-- After one half, Auburn’s passing game has sputtered as Payton Thorne is just 2-for-10 for 20 yards.

-- Fortunately for Auburn, after being completely ineffective last week against New Mexico State, the Tigers’ run game has returned as both Jarquez Hunter (10 rushes, 80 yards) and Damari Alston (6 rushes, 73 yards, touchdown) have been efficient.

-- The average distance to go for Auburn’s offense on third down has been 9.7 yards. That’s compared to an average of just 5.7 yards for Alabama. As such, the Tigers are just 2-for-7 on third down, while the Crimson Tide is 4-for-8.

Alabama halftime analysis

The Crimson Tide was its own worst enemy this half. Alabama had two touchdowns taken off the board due to penalties, which Nick Saban noted on the game broadcast sapped its momentum.

UA will need to be better at stopping the run in the second half, after giving up 181 yards on the ground. The Crimson Tide has a clear talent advantage, and would be wise to utilize it after the break, perhaps looking for more plays like the 68-yard touchdown over the top to Jermaine Burton.

-- A 18-yard pass from Milroe to Niblack and a 10-yard rush by Jase McClellan moves the Tide into Tiger territory.

-- Payton Thorne finds Ja’Varrius Johnson wide open for a 28-yard touchdown. After the made PAT, the Tigers are out front 21-20.

-- A Kendrick Law blindside block penalty negates an Alabama first down in the red zone. Milroe’s pass on the ensuing third down is incomplete.

-- Alabama goes 3 & out and will punt with 4:58 left. Huge defensive stand for Auburn.

4:48 -- Koy Moore slipped and fumbled the return. Alabama’s Jihaad Campbell recovered at the AU 30. You can’t return a muff, but Alabama’s gonna have the ball.
