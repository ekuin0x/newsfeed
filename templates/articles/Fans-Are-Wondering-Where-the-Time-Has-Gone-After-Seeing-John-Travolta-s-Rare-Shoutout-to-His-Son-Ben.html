                <textarea id="text" readonly> Yet again, John Travolta is the proudest papa to his children. This time, he’s talking about how proud he is of his now-teenaged son Ben!

On Nov 23, the Grease star shared a compilation video of his son Ben to his Instagram. He shared the video with the caption reading, “I can’t believe my baby boy is now a teenager. Ben turns 13 today. I love you my son!”

In the video, we see a bunch of clips of Travolta’s youngest, such as clips of him singing into an oversized Hershey syrup bottle, some of him playing with dogs, hanging out in a field, and more. And he wasn’t the only one wondering where the time has gone.

Fans wrote things like “Whoa! How did that happen?” and even fellow celebs like Simpsons star Nancy Cartwright wrote, “WOW!!! 13?!?! A happy happy day to celebrate and give thanks all at once to your lovely boy-boy! HBTY, Ben!❤️🎂🧡🎂🤎🎂🦃❤️.”

Travolta and the late Kelly Preston welcomed three children named Jett, who sadly passed away at the age of 16 in 2009, Ella Bleu, 22, and Benjamin, now 13.

Travolta has often expressed how proud he is of his son Ben, and in a super-rare interview with People, he talked about how his son has a penchant for the truth. In the interview, he discussed how he went about talking about his mother’s death. “I said, ‘But you know, Ben … you always love the truth and I’m going to tell you the truth about life. Nobody knows when they’re gonna go or when they’re going to stay,'” John recalled. “Your brother [Jett] left at 16. Too young. Your mother left at 57. That was too young. But who’s to say? I could die tomorrow. You could. Anybody can.”

He added, “So let’s look at it like it’s part of life. You don’t know exactly. You just do your best at trying to live the longest you can.”

These celebrity kids want to follow in their parents’ footsteps.
