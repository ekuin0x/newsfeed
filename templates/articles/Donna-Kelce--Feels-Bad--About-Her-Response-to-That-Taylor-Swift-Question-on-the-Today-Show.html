                <textarea id="text" readonly> Donna Kelce showed up on the Today Show back in October, and—ICYMI—she was promptly asked about hanging with Taylor Swift at Travis Kelce's Chiefs games. And while trying to keep things chill/low-key, Donna ended up unintentionally coming off as slightly less than impressed.

"It's fairly new, so I don’t like to talk about it," Donna said. "It’s just one of those things where everyone saw me. I was in the boxes with her. It’s another thing that’s amped up my life."

She was also asked what it was like to hang with Tay, and simply said "It was okay."

And poor Donna still feels bad about the moment according to the Wall Street Journal, which wrote in its profile of Travis that "Donna Kelce still berates herself for how she handled a question about Taylor on the Today show." The outlet also noted that she was "trying not to sound too enthusiastic" and accidentally "came off underwhelmed."

Despite this, Travis didn't want his mom to feel bad and "immediately" called Donna to reassure her. Donna, meanwhile, spoke with the Wall Street Journal for Travis' profile and said, "I can tell you this. He’s happier than I’ve seen him in a long time…God bless him, he shot for the stars!"

Glad that got cleared up, and before we go, here's a cute quote from Trav: "Everybody knows I’m a family guy. Her team is her family. Her family does a lot of stuff in terms of the tour, the marketing, being around, so I think she has a lot of those values as well, which is right up my alley."
