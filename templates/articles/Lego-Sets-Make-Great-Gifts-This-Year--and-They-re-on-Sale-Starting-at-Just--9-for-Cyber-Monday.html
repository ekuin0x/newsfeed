But Cyber Monday deals abound, including on a variety of Lego sets that will appeal to people of any age group, whether they’re seasoned pros or brand new to the iconic toy. Amazon has all kinds of discounted Lego sets for Cyber Monday, ranging from Star Wars-themed to floral creations and even a sophisticated New York City skyline set.

Lego Star Wars Luke Skywalker X-Wing Fighter Set, $40 (Save $10)

Amazon

Got a Star Wars fan on your holiday shopping list this season? Don’t wait to snag this Star Wars X-Wing Fighter set while it’s on sale for $40. The 474-piece set includes retractable landing gear and movable wings, plus it comes with mini figurines of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, General Dodonna, and (of course!) R2-D2.



One parent shared that their 8-year-old found the set “fun to assemble” with “no problems.” Another reviewer bought this for a significant other who was “a huge Star Wars fan” and they “loved this gift.”

Amazon

Fans of Batman will appreciate finding this batmobile Lego set in their stocking this season. Over 3,000 people have purchased the set in the past month alone, and right now it’s on sale for the lowest price we’ve seen all year. It consists of 392 pieces and comes with Batman and the Penguin figurines. The car itself can fire missiles, which is sure to impress recipients.

Multiple shoppers have called the set a “great gift” and agree that it’s “fun to build.” One reviewer wrote, “I got this for my hubby and he loved it,” adding, “It looks really cool in his office.”

Lego Creator 3-in-1 Magical Unicorn, $9 (Save $1)

Amazon

Though this animal-themed Lego set doesn’t have the largest discount on our list, it comes in under $10 and is a 3-in-1 set with 145 pieces. Animal lovers can choose to build a rainbow unicorn, and then transform it into a seahorse followed by a peacock. At about 5 inches tall, it’s the perfect size for a desk, dresser, or nightstand.

“Bought [this] as a gift for a 5-year-old,” a customer said. “She loved putting together the unicorn and needed very little help when she followed the directions given.” Another savvy shopper even stocks up on multiples of the set as “backup gifts for unexpected birthday parties” since they like that “you can make three things instead of just one.”

Lego Classic Large Creative Brick Box Building Set, $33 (Save $27)

Amazon

Some toys just bring on nostalgia like nothing else, and that’s true of this classic Lego brick set that’s on sale for 46 percent off — the lowest price it’s been all year. It’s a thoughtful gift for anyone ages four to 99, and it’s sure to inspire a spark of inspiration with the 33 colors of Lego bricks. It also comes with eight kinds of windows and doors, two green base plates, and six tires and rims to provide a foundation for all sorts of creations.

The set has raked in over 22,600 perfect ratings in part because it allows people to use “imagination and creativity,” according to shoppers. “I bought it so I can have something to fidget with, as well as something my nieces and nephews can play with,” another five-star reviewer explained.

Lego Marvel Thanos Glove with Infinity Stones, $64 (Save $16)

Amazon

Amazon’s Cyber Monday sales have something for Marvel Universe fans, too. This set comes with the golden Thanos glove with infinity stones from Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame and has fingers that move. It also includes a stand so you can easily display your handiwork.

More than 5,000 shoppers have bought it this month alone. “Just finished building the Lego Marvel Infinity Gauntlet, and wow, it's so much cooler than I expected! The colors are vibrant and the details are spot on,” shared a reviewer. They and other customers agreed the instructions are “easy to follow” and the set is “very fun to build.”

Lego New York City Skyline Model Kit, $48 (Save $12)

Amazon

Dreaming of a trip to the Big Apple but missed out on Black Friday’s travel deals? Snag the next best thing ahead of Cyber Monday with this 598-piece Lego set that will bring the New York City skyline to you. You’ll be able to re-create the Flatiron, Chrysler, Empire State, and One World Trade buildings — though on a much smaller scale.

“Turned out to be fun and a bit educational,” wrote a reviewer whose 10-year-old enjoyed building the set and “learning which building was what.” The set even earned praise from a native New Yorker who said, “New York City, a.k.a Manhattan, is one of America's most iconic cities and this Lego skyline set captures some of [its] most famous landmarks beautifully.”
