                <textarea id="text" readonly> As a travel writer with a knack for finding the best deals on travel essentials out there, huge shopping events like Cyber Monday are my Super Bowl. And from what I’m seeing, these early sales are almost too good to be true with discounts in the 75 percent off-range in virtually every department: travel-ready clothes, time-saving accessories, outdoor gear, and more.

To ease your shopping experience, I've curated a list of the best deals available that I plan to take advantage of, and I’m also sharing it with you. Whether you’re gearing up for your next adventure or getting gifts for everyone on your shopping list, these 115 deals are a can’t miss. So don't wait too long; start shopping now and discover your new essential travel companions before the sale concludes Monday night.
