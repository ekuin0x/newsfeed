                <textarea id="text" readonly> Is it chilly in here — or did someone just mention Meghan Markle?

In a revealing new book entitled “Endgame,” Royal expert Omid Scobie claims Kate Middleton has “jokingly shivered” at the sound of her estranged sister-in-law’s name.

The author claims Kate, 41, and Markle, 42 have had “almost zero direct communication” since 2019 but have shared “short pleasantries” here and there, according to Us.

Scobie, 42, further claims in the book that there are no signs of a reconciliation between Markle and Kate — or between Kate and Harry, either.

Markle and husband Prince Harry, 39, stepped down as senior members of the British royal family in 2020.

However, sources claimed in August that Harry and Kate were allegedly speaking in secret phone calls as a “kind gesture,” in an apparent effort to mend the family’s relationship.

The Post has contacted reps for Markle and Kensington Palace for comment.

There had been rumors of a rift between the princesses, and even their husbands, brothers Harry and William, for years prior to their departure, including a spat over Princess Charlotte’s flower girl dress ahead of Harry and Meghan’s 2018 royal wedding.

It was originally reported that Markle made Middleton cry — only for the opposite to later be reported. </textarea>
