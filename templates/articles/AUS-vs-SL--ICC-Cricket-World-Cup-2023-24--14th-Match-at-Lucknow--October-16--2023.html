                <textarea id="text" readonly> 27.6 to BKG Mendis , Warner pulls off another spectacular grab in the outfield. He runs across from deep midwicket, covers plenty of ground, and completes the diving catch. He gets into a side-on position, digs his knee into the ground, but still hangs onto the catch. Zampa drags his length back, tosses it up, and has Mendis splicing a sweep . 165 / 3

29.1 to S Samarawickrama , another appeal, this time from Zampa. This time umpire Wilson raises his finger. Seems like the slider from Zampa or perhaps it was the natural variation. Yes, replays indicate it's the legbreak that doesn't turn. Beats the inside edge and pings the front pad well below the knee-roll. Is this hitting leg stump? Ball-tracking returns umpire's call on leg stump, enough for umpire Wilson's call to be upheld. Zampa and Cummins have turned it around for Australia . 166 / 4

37.6 to C Karunaratne , That looks close and the finger goes up! Karunaratne doesn't even review it as he's rapped on the front pad by the googly. He looks to play the forward defence but does not read it. Sri Lanka sliding fast . 196 / 7 </textarea>
