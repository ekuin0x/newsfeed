UPDATE: Nov. 25, 2023, 6:36 p.m. EST We've updated this story with the latest deals from the Walmart early Cyber Monday sale, plus a preview of deals going live tomorrow.

Black Friday may be over, but it's not over over. At least 95 percent of the best Walmart Black Friday deals are still in stock and online (trust us, we checked), and even more deals will be announced now that we're approaching Cyber Week. You can learn more about the Walmart Cyber Monday sale below (spoiler alert: it starts on Sunday), but all of the rollbacks in this guide are live right now.

Early birds already know that Walmart launched its first round of Black Friday deals back on Nov. 8 and dished out another round the day before Thanksgiving. Some of the retailer's most popular rollbacks have already sold out. Leave items in your shopping cart too long, and you'll risk losing out on your haul.

If you've held out until now to do your shopping, we've compiled a list of more than 200 of the best deals from Walmart's early Cyber Monday sale and highlighted our favorites from different departments. We'll be updating the list throughout Cyber Monday, so keep checking back.

Is Walmart holding a Cyber Monday sale?

Glad you asked. If you don't have time to shop the Black Friday sales or you missed out on a great deal earlier this month, don't you worry. Walmart just announced its official Cyber Monday sale will start on Sunday, Nov. 26 at 7 p.m. ET, exclusively on Walmart.com and the Walmart app. If you're a Walmart+ member, you can access the sale three hours in advance, starting at 4 p.m. ET.

This is the first time Walmart has given early access to Walmart+ members for its Cyber Monday sale (although it usually does so for Black Friday). The Cyber Monday sale promises deals on top gifts with savings of up to 80% on apparel, beauty, tech, toys, and more. Plus, since so many Walmart Black Friday deals are still online, there's no need to wait until Sunday night. Stay tuned for the best deals from the sale in the coming days.

Note: All newly added deals are marked with a ✨. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.

Walmart early Cyber Monday sneak peek deals

Live on Nov. 26

TV deals

Why we like it

The best Walmart Cyber Monday deals typically include giant rollbacks on TVs, and that tradition continues in 2023. Unfortunately, many popular 4K TVs sold out way before Black Friday officially began, but there are still solid cheap 4K TVs lingering as we get closer to Cyber Week. This 55-inch QLED TV was already affordable at full price and is now seeing an extra $50 discount, pushing it below $350. Thanks to its extra layer of quantum dots, you'll be able to appreciate rich colors and deep blacks even during the day.

Laptop deals

Why we like it

The total discount on this HP laptop isn't the biggest rollback we've seen so far, but it's a deceptively good deal on an underpriced laptop. With an Intel Core i5 processor, this business 2-in-1 will be more than capable of handling your day-to-day work (and after-work streaming and surfing). While supplies last, you can get this device for under $400, which is actually a better price than the original Black Friday deal.

Headphone/earbud deals

Why we like it

When we tell you that a deal may sell out, we're not just saying that for effect. The weekend has barely begun, and already Walmart's deal on the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) is gone. But don't get too down, because the second-gen Apple AirPods are still available for just $89.99. We talked a lot about inflation in 2023, but AirPods for under $100? Not bad at all.

Tablet deals

Why we like it

This is the iPad deal to end all iPad deals, and we've seen it before. During major shopping events, both Walmart and Amazon mark down the 10.2-inch 2021 iPad (64GB) to $249, which is cheaper than any iPad has a right to be. When we first saw this deal, we assumed it was for a refurbished product, but it's not. The 2021 base model iPad is still much smoother and faster than your average tablet, and did we mention it only costs $249? This product is currently sold out at Amazon, which makes this a Walmart-exclusive deal as of this writing.

Smartwatch deals

Why we like it

Apple's latest entry-level wearable also has a new record-low price at Walmart for Cyber Monday (which works out to a 28% savings). It's lighter and 20 percent faster than the original Apple Watch SE from 2020, and it features most of the same health tools as the new flagship Apple Watch Series 9 — that includes heart rate notifications, Emergency SOS, Cycle Tracking, and Fall and Crash Detection. It also offers a comparable 18-hour battery life and water resistance.

Gaming deals

Why we like it

With $439 as the new all-time low price for this Xbox bundle, you're basically getting a free copy of Diablo IV on top of a $60 discount on the Series X (which typically sells for $499.99 on its own). The only other retailer that was matching it at the time of writing was the Microsoft Store itself, and its markdown seems to have popped up recently in response to Walmart's doorbuster: A post on the Xbox Wire had previously pegged its Black Friday price there at $509.99.

Speaker and soundbar deals

Why we like it

The older version of our favorite portable Bluetooth speaker is decently loud for its compact size, IPX7-rated for waterproofing, and capable of charging other devices via USB (hence its name) — it's ideal for traveling. It usually retails for $179.95 on the JBL website, meaning Walmart's $89 Cyber Monday price is an even better deal than advertised.

Vacuum deals

Why we like it

Dyson's V15 Detect is a cordless stick vacuum with a fancy LCD screen and a bright built-in laser that illuminates tiny crumbs, pet hairs, and dust particles on your floors (so you can be sure you're actually cleaning them thoroughly); the premium Absolute variant has a shiny gold finish, HEPA filtration, and an extra dusting/crevice tool. Walmart's Cyber Monday deal saves you 27% and makes it $100 cheaper than the Dyson V12 Detect Slim, which has a smaller dust bin and less suction power.

Robot vacuum deals

Why we like it

Yeedi's vacuum and mopping stations have received high praise from Mashable reviewers, and as part of Walmart's Black Friday sale, this hybrid model gives you mid-range and premium features at a budget price. As a hybrid, this combo device will mop your floors in addition to vacuuming them, but it also comes with a self-empty station and 3,000Pa of suction for making pet hair and dust vanish into thin air.

Home and kitchen deals

Why we like it

Normally, air fryers are hot commodities during Black Friday, but this year we haven't seen as many deals. (Remember when those mint-colored Dash air fryers were everywhere?) Already, some of Walmart's best Black Friday deals on air fryers have sold out, but as part of its early Cyber Monday sale, a Ninja air fryer is marked down to under $100. This air fryer has two baskets with independent temperature settings, making it easier to prepare multiple dishes at once.

Outdoor deals

Why we like it

Featuring a removable ashtray and a lightweight stainless steel design (plus its own carrying case), the Solo Stove Ranger 2.0 is a smaller version of our favorite smokeless fire pit — and yes, it really is virtually smokeless. This bundle throws in a stand that allows it to safely burn on decks or green grass, and it actually retails for $264.99 on the brand's website; Walmart's list price is slightly deflated, so it's an even better deal than it appears to be.

Apple deals

Why we like it

The Apple Watch Series 9 is "a robust and elite wearable device – the best Apple has ever made," according to Mashable Senior Editor Stan Schroeder. While it looks almost identical to its predecessor, it's equipped with a new s9 chip, which makes it about 30 percent snappier than before. It also boasts double the storage and has double the peak brightness and a fun new Double Tap feature. It's not an essential upgrade if you already have a Series 7 or 8, but it's certainly a step in the right direction for those with older watches. At $359 for the 45mm GPS version, it's currently sitting at an all-time low cost at Walmart.

Pet deals

Why we like it

A solid dog tracking device for pet parents on a budget, Tractive gives you the ability to track your dog's live location within the companion app. It also allows you to set up a virtual fence and notifies you when your pet steps out of (or enters) the safe area. It's not perfect — the battery is just so-so and the live tracking can be a bit glitchy — but for the price, it's hard to beat. Save $20 for Cyber Monday at Walmart and snag it for only $29.99.

Fitness deals

Why we like it

The Walmart-exclusive Echelon Connect Sport is a solid Peloton alternative for a retail price that won't make you cringe. And for Cyber Monday, it's on sale for over $400 off, knocking the price down to a super impressive $297. But just because it's wallet-friendly doesn't mean its specs don't impress. The Connect Sport features 32 levels of silent magnetic resistance, aero handlebars and adjustable pedals, and Bluetooth technology that lets you connect any smart device to the Echelon Fit app. Speaking of which, the app gives you access to 40+ daily live and 15,000+ on-demand connected fitness classes. The $297 Cyber Monday cost even includes a 30-day free trial of Echelon Premier membership to get you started.

Toys and gift deals

Why we like it

Polaroid may make the coolest-looking instant cameras (who doesn't love a retro aesthetic?), but in our experience, Fujifilm's InstaX Minis are by far the best options. This bundle is perfect for gifting, and it comes with everything you'll need to start snapping photos right away. This would be a perfect gift for anyone who's been spending a little too much time on Instagram lately, and it comes in a convenient box that's all ready for gift wrapping.
