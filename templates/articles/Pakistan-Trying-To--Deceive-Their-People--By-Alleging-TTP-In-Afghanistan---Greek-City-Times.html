                <textarea id="text" readonly> The Islamic Emirate said that the repeated allegations by Pakistani officials regarding the presence of Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan in Afghanistan are aimed at changing the mindset of the country’s populations.

The Islamic Emirate’s spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said that Islamabad lacks the capacity to prevent the security incidents, hence it is accusing the government of Afghanistan.

“As they failed in some actions, they cannot prevent the attacks in Pakistan. In order to deceive their people and downplay the issue, they refer it to Afghanistan, so that the mindset of the people in Pakistan changes,” he said.

He made the remarks in reaction to the caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan, who called on the “Afghan Taliban” to decide whether they themselves will take action against those terrorists who were using their soil to carry out attacks inside Pakistan or hand them over to Islamabad.

According to the reports, Kakar said the Afghanistan interim government’s “inaction” over “terror activities” against Pakistan was “unacceptable.” The Islamic Emirate has said before that the territory of Afghanistan will not be used against any country.

Political analysts suggested that Pakistan stop making allegations in a bid to pave the ground for the improvement of relations between Kabul and Islamabad.

“The Pakistan Prime Minister Anwar-ul- Haq Kakar shamelessly and unjustly is trying to make allegations against the people of Afghanistan and the Islamic Emirate. They should know that ensuring security of their country and people is not the job of the Islamic Emirate,” said Ahmad Khan Andar, political analyst.

“It is better that Pakistan seeks the solution on its own soil. It [TTP] is inside Pakistan’s soil,” said Mohammad Matin Mohammad Khail, political analyst.

Earlier, Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, spokesperson for Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry, claimed that they have shared evidence of TTP activity in Afghanistan, but Kabul denied it. </textarea>
