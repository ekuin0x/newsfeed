Trent Alexander-Arnold’s low finish ten minutes from time earned Liverpool a point against Manchester City as the Premier League‘s top two played out a 1-1 draw.

A relatively even contest never quite burst into life at the Etihad Stadium as two familiar foes kept each other largey in check.

Erling Haaland had put Manchester City into a first half lead, latching on to a through ball from Nathan Ake after an errant clearance from Alisson before firing into the bottom corner past the Brazilian goalkeeper.

It was the Norwegian’s 50th Premier League goal, the striker achieving the mark in his 48th game to comfortably break Andy Cole’s record.

And Haaland very nearly added a second a matter of moments before Alexander-Arnold equalised up the other end, Alisson’s block crucial and sparking the counter attack from which the right back neatly tucked home.

The draw ends a 23-match winning run at home for Manchester City, who could be overhauled at the top of the table if Arsenal beat Brentford later on Saturday.
