                <textarea id="text" readonly> T.I. got into a physical altercation with his son at an Atlanta Falcons NFL game as a family dispute over 'silver spoon' taunts got ugly.

The 43-year-old rapper - born Clifford Joseph Harris Jr. - and his wife Tiny, 48, hosted their 19-year-old son King and others in a luxury suite at Mercedes-Benz stadium on Sunday when the father and son got into a fight.

T.I. had performed at the 50th anniversary of Hip-Hop celebration at the Falcons game when a playful back-and-forth got heated as King livestreamed the whole incident on Instagram.

At the beginning of the clip the Rubber Band Man hitmaker could be heard saying: 'King, have you ever woke up with a roach on your face?'

King was not too pleased by the statement as he revealed that he did not even grow up in his parents' mansion and instead lived with his grandmother.

Uh oh: T.I. and his wife Tiny, 48, hosted their 19-year-old son King and others in a luxury suite at Mercedes-Benz stadium on Sunday when the father and son got into a fight

Not pleased: T.I. had performed at the 50th anniversary of Hip-Hop celebration at the Falcons game when a playful back-and-forth got heated as King livestreamed the whole incident on Instagram

That was when Tiny -real name Tameka Dianne Cottle-Harris - did not hold back as took the phone as she said: 'I'mma tell you the reason why he wanted to be over there. Y'all ready?

'Cause he can suck a pacifier over there. 12-years-old he was sucking a pacifier since he was 12-years-old. He didn't do that in the house. He cried like a baby.'

King was not too pleased about the revelation as he took back the phone and was defiant.

He angrily responded: 'They try to say I was over there trying to suck a paci but they ain't going to tell you everything like that. They trying to hide it. He capping.'

It seemed like T.I. and Tiny's eldest child together reached a bit of a breaking point as he started to scream that he is known for standing on his business and even accused his parents of being drunk.

King said: 'Y'all n***as had too much too drink. N***as done drunk too much.'

T.I. then accuses his son of being 'emotional' to which King says that he and his mother are lying and joking AKA 'capping.'

King begins screaming as Tiny attempts to calm him down by wrapping her hands around the back of his neck.

Upset: King was not too pleased by the statement as he revealed that he did not even grow up in his parents' mansion and instead lived with his grandmother

That was when Tiny -real name Tameka Dianne Cottle-Harris - did not hold back as took the phone as she said: 'I'mma tell you the reason why he wanted to be over there. Y'all ready? Cause he can suck a pacifier over there. 12-years-old he was sucking a pacifier since he was 12-years-old. He didn't do that in the house. He cried like a baby.'

That is when T.I could be heard chiming in as the patriarch says: 'You are embarrassing yourself and your family. You are embarrassing yourself'

Then it seemingly begins to get physical as the camera is covered as King could be heard screaming 'Get off of me' as T.I. continues by saying 'you are embarrassing yourself'

It does not seem to work as the teenager continually screams to his mother about his father: 'Who you letting him play me like that!?'

Tiny tries to tell him that his father is joking but King does not believe him.

That is when T.I could be heard chiming in as the patriarch says: 'You are embarrassing yourself and your family. You are embarrassing yourself.'

Then it seemingly begins to get physical as the camera is covered as King could be heard screaming 'Get off of me' as T.I. continues by saying 'you are embarrassing yourself.'

For a moment the camera could see the bottom of T.I.'s face as it is clear that he has his son in some kind of headlock.

The Whatever You Like hitmaker then defiantly tells his son: 'Boy, you can't do nothing with me. Ain't s*** you can do with me.'

T.I. and Tiny welcomed King in 2004 after the rapper already had a huge success with studio album Trap Muzik which went platinum.

The couple have two other children together: 15-year-old Major and seven-year-old Heiress.

Back in September 2021, T.I. and Tiny had been cleared of sexual assault charges months after a woman came forward and alleged the rapper and his wife drugged and assaulted her 16 years earlier after meeting in a nightclub

T.I. has three children from prior relationships: 23-year-old son Messiah and 22-year-old daughter Domani with ex Lashon Dixon along with 22-year-old daughter Deyjah with his other ex Ms. Niko.

Tiny has a 27-year-old daughter named Zonnique with ex Zonnie Pullins.

Back in September 2021, T.I. and Tiny had been cleared of sexual assault charges.

Earlier on in 2021, a woman came forward and alleged the rapper and his wife drugged and assaulted her 16 years earlier after meeting in a nightclub.

She claimed in court documents that she was first introduced to the couple by a man handing out flyers at a local mall, and she was invited to a club where they would be the following night.

In an Instagram video, the rapper was adamant and denied 'all these disgusting, anonymous allegations.'

Prosecutors decided not to move forward with the case because it fell outside the 10-year statute of limitations in September 2021, which was initially reported by TMZ.

The outcome was similar to another case, where another woman accused T.I. and Tiny of drugging and sexually assaulted her in Las Vegas back in 2010. The Las Vegas case also fell outside the statute of limitations, so there were ultimately no charges.

While addressing various allegations, T.I. suggested he and his wife had consensual sex with other people within their relationship but that no one was ever forced to do anything they did not want to do.

'Whatever we have done, has been done with consensual adults who into what we into and like what we like,' he said in the video posted on January 29, 2021, adding, 'Ain't never raped nobody, never raped nobody.' </textarea>
