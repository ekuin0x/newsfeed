                <textarea id="text" readonly> Afghanistan pacer Naveen-ul-Haq will remember the ongoing World Cup for the rest of his life for his team's inspiring success but the fast bowler won't reverse his decision to retire from the One-Day format at the end of the tournament.

Afghanistan created ripples with their win over defending champions England last week and on Monday the team from the strife-torn nation exceeded expectations by drubbing Pakistan with consummate ease.

Naveen to stick to his decision to retire from ODIs

The 24-year-old Naveen had made a shock announcement last month that he would quit the ODIs at the end of the World Cup in India.

He took the decision to prolong his T20 career.

Now that Afghanistan's performance has created a huge impact, he was asked if he would rethink his retirement decision.

"Not at all. That's the final decision I have made. Luckily, I will remember this World Cup for the rest of my life," Naveen-ul-Haq told reporters after Afghanistan's first ever victory over Pakistan.

Naveen dedicates Afghanistan's win to his people back home

"It does mean a lot back home to the people of our country. We all know the situation back home. There was also an earthquake that happened a few days ago.

"There is not a lot of happiness in the country without cricket. So, at least we have given them some moments of happiness tonight. Going deeper into the tournament, every game and two points count. The win tonight (Monday) is quite big for us."

Naveen admitted that there are areas that they still need to improve, majorly being leaking runs at the closing stages of the innings, as Pakistan scored 101 runs in the last ten overs.

IPL experience helping Naveen in India

"We still have a lot of things to be improved, especially the way we conceded a few runs at the back end of the innings. They played well, but we can improve and do well in the upcoming games."

Naveen, who plays for Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL, also gave credit to the tournament for shaping their players for this World Cup.

"That's true. IPL happens here in India, and along with that experience, coming and playing here (in Chennai) or any other venue does give you a lot of confidence." </textarea>
