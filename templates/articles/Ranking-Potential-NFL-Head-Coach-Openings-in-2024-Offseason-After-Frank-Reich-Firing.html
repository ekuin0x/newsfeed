The Washington Commanders have been plagued by mediocrity for much of the last decade. The team has at least seven wins in all but one season since 2015 but hasn't won more than nine games in any of those years. Being stuck in the NFL's version of purgatory—not good enough to contend, evidenced by nothing more than a pair of Wild Card Round losses in that span, but not bad enough to earn a franchise-altering draft pick near the top of the order—has left this organization desperate for someone to lead it down a different path.

Ron Rivera has not been the man to do it, going just 26-35-1 during his tenure. With the team now 4-8 and staring down its worst showing since he took the reins in 2020, it's almost certain a different regime will take over soon. The team's new ownership group has been linked with Bill Belichick and seems poised to make a run at a marquee name who could help put Washington football back on the map.

The Commanders do look quite a bit more appealing than they did at this time last year thanks to the emergence of Sam Howell as a potential franchise quarterback. The second-year signal-caller surprisingly leads the league in passing yards and has racked up 18 touchdowns in 12 games during his first full season as the starter. While Howell hasn't been perfect—he's thrown 13 interceptions and taken a whopping 55 sacks, 15 more than the next most sacked quarterback—he offers far more potential and upside than any of the 11 other starting signal-callers Washington has trotted out since Kirk Cousins left in 2018. </textarea>
