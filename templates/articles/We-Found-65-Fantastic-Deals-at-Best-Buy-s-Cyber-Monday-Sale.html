TV Deals

Read our Best TVs guide for more details and recommendations.

Photograph: Hisense

The Hisense U8K (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has a mini-LED display that delivers excellent black levels, and it comes with a Google TV interface that's easy to use. There's a 120-Hz screen refresh rate for gaming and decent speakers. The feet are on the ends though, so you'll want to mount it or pair it with a long TV stand.

This deal is just $3 more than the best price we've tracked for the LG C3 OLED. The set is the Best TV for gamers thanks to its super-smooth 120-Hz refresh rate and 9.1-millisecond response time. True to LG OLED models, the black levels are perfect and far deeper than any TV in this list.

Sony is best known these days for its OLED screens, but its LED TVs like the X90L still pack a punch with a mix of excellent picture processing, good brightness, and great local dimming for rich contrast. Like a lot of TVs this time of year, this 65-inch set is at the lowest price we've seen it all year.

We love Samsung's Frame TVs for their elegant design backed by very good picture quality. These TVs blend into your decor to display art when not in use, then bounce back to a great TV when you need one. Note: If you want a bigger screen you can get an even better deal on the 75-inch version at Walmart.

This entry-level TCL TV isn't for videophiles, but if you're looking for a large screen on a very tight budget, it definitely fits the bill. With a Fire TV operating system and features like ALLM for gaming, this is a solid value at a very low price.

Bose has updated its Smart 900 soundbar to include better bass extension, helping fortify an already great sound profile. With true up-firing drivers, the system also provides expansive Dolby Atmos and virtual surround sound for a cinematic performance from a single unit, and this is the first time we've seen its price drop.

Vizio M-Series 5.1.2 Photograph: Vizio

Vizio has long been a master at soundbar value, and the M-Series 5.1.2 soundbar (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the poster boy for all we love about the brand. Here you’ll find clear, full, and immersive sound in a no-nonsense multi-speaker system for hundreds less than we’d expect to pay even at full price, making this deal all the sweeter.

Bose’s Smart Soundbar 900 debuted at a price that matched its title, which makes this deal particularly enticing. As the brand’s former flagship soundbar, the 900 is loaded with a premium design, plenty of networking features, and Dolby Atmos sound that’s strikingly immersive from a single bar.

This baseline stereo soundbar from Samsung is probably too expensive at full cost but at just over $100, it could be hard to pass up. The 2.1-channel bar offers a serious upgrade from your TV audio, including a wireless subwoofer for cinematic punch, at a very good price.

This stylish projector from Samsung offers up to 100-inches of screen real estate as well as cool features like Samsung's built-in smart interface and gaming hub. It can also go portable with compatible add-on USB-C battery packs (not included) making it a great option for an outdoor movie night.

Laptop, Tablet, and Phone Deals

Photograph: Apple

In our testing, the ninth-generation iPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best iPad for most people. It's affordable (even without this discount) and has everything you need, including a good camera, excellent display, and a physical Touch ID-enabled home button. All current iPad accessories will work too—like the first-generation Apple Pencil and Apple's Smart Keyboard.

The iPad Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our go-to tablet for travel. It's small enough to slip into my backpack and fits perfectly on an airplane tray table. With an 8.3-inch display, it's great for watching movies or reading ebooks, as well as sketching and taking notes. It's powerful enough for taxing apps and games. Apple may have an updated version next year, but this is still a good deal.

We recommend the iPad Air (8/10, WIRED Recommends) as an upgrade over the iPad (9th Gen). It packs a 10.9-inch LCD screen, a USB-C port, slim bezels, Touch ID built into the top power button, and the same M1 processor as the 2020 MacBook Air. It also has support for both the second-generation Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard Cover, and Magic Keyboard Cover. It dipped lower to $460 in July, but we still think this is a solid deal.

Photograph: Microsoft

The Surface Pro 9 is the Best 2-in-1 Microsoft Surface and one of our favorite tablets. This model features the specs we recommend, with even more RAM than is wholly necessary for most people. It also includes the excellent keyboard. The battery doesn't last as long as we'd like, and there's no microSD card slot, but the tablet's performance and display are both smooth and snappy. The 5G version is also on sale for $1,249 ($550 off).

It's been less than a month since Apple released this MacBook Pro and it's already on sale. It's got the same mini LED screen, 120-Hz refresh rate, brighter display, and 1080p webcam as the high-end versions. You'll also get an HDMI, two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4, an SD card slot, a headphone jack, and a MagSafe charging port. We recommend the M3 for anyone who wants some of the Pro features but doesn't want to drop almost $2,000 to get them.

This is the slightly larger, slightly heavier version of the Asus Zenbook 14 that we really like (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It has the same gorgeous 14-inch 2.8K OLED touch display that's very impressive for a laptop this size. Unlike the mid-range model we tested, this features an Intel i7 (13700H) 16 gigabytes of RAM and a 512-gigabyte SSD. You're getting the high end model for the price of the mid range. It's plenty of speed for most computing tasks.

Photograph: HP

We like the 15-inch HP Envy (8/10, WIRED Recommends) for its impressive performance, very nice screen, and decent keyboard, complete with a dedicated emoji button. Graphics are courtesy of the integrated AMD Radeon chipset, which underpins the 1920 x 1080-pixel, 16:9 aspect ratio display. It's no gaming rig, but it works. Connectivity options include two USB-C ports with DisplayPort capabilities, two USB-A ports, and an HDMI 2.1 port, plus a full-size SD card reader.

The Google Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fantastic Android tablet, especially with the included charging dock—which doubles as a speaker. Every capacity and color is on sale right now. The performance and screen are both great for the price, but we wish the battery life and available accessories were better. You can set up to eight user profiles, so anyone in the family can use it with their own apps and homescreen.

The Google Pixel 7A (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Pixel phone and the best Android phone for most people. It has great value when it's full-price, so this discount makes it extra enticing. It's snappy, powerful, water-resistant, and capable of charging wirelessly. The camera is great too.

Fitness Tracker Deals

Fitbit Charge 6 Photograph: Fitbit

The Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Review) is the newest version in the Charge lineup. Its predecessor remains our favorite fitness tracker, but this price is the best we've seen for the newest model. The companion app leaves a bit to be desired, there's no fall detection, and Bluetooth connectivity is glitchy. You should also be aware that to access every feature, you'll need a Fitbit Premium subscription that costs $10 per month. (A free 6-month trial is included with your purchase.) With all that being said, especially at this price, the Fitbit Charge 6 is a simple and focused fitness tracker with a pretty robust suite of health metrics.

The Apple Watch Ultra 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old but it's already on sale. It's our favorite smartwatch for outdoor sports. It packs a new (and bright) 3,000-nit display, the latest S9 chip for faster processing, and the new ultra-wideband chip for precision-locating your phone. As with last year's version, it also comes equipped with a useful Action button and the three-mic array. It's a great option if you're heavily into outdoor sports and are looking for a rugged, full-functioning smartwatch to take along with you. It's also the Apple Watch with the best battery life thanks to its massive size.

Earbud and Headphone Deals

Google Pixel Buds Pro Photograph: Google

The Google Pixel Buds Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are truly excellent earbuds. They're featured in our list of the Best Wirefree Earbuds as the top pick for Android phone users. This deal price matches the lowest we have seen. With punchy bass, a comfortable fit, and solid battery life, it's hard to find a better pair of headphones for the money.

Bose's Headphones 700 aren't spring chickens, but they hide their age with a futuristic look to go along with solid features, clear sound, and noise-canceling that still ranks among the best-in-class. This is the lowest price we've seen, making now a great time to snap these up before they're gone for good.

The Beats Studio Pro Wireless Headphones (7/10, WIRED Review) pack excellent calling and noise canceling, good sound quality, and fantastic wireless range into a stable, compact design. There are a few things missing here, including sensors for auto-pause and multi-band EQ. But with improved sound quality and ANC, they're still a solid option—especially when they're on sale. This is the lowest price we've tracked, so far.

Beats Powerbeats Pro Photograph: Beats

The Powerbeats Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) came out in 2019, but these are still our top recommendation for earbuds with the most secure fit—making them an excellent option for the most intensive workouts. With an IPX4 water-resistance rating, they'll also stay protected from sweat. They have excellent sound quality and offer an impressive nine hours of battery life.

Sennheiser's top noise-canceling headphones got a redesign in the Momentum 4 that includes a new look, massive battery life, and some solid feature upgrades. Noise-canceling is capped at good rather than great, but their class-leading sound makes up for it, especially at this significant price drop.

Sony's working-class noise cancelers offer solid performance. clear sound, and impressive battery life at a much more reasonable price than the brand's top offerings. With this sale, they offer some of the best value in their class from one of the top names in the business.

JBL Endurance Peak 3 Photograph: JBL

JBL's Endurance Peak 3 are that rare pair of earbuds you can feel comfortable wearing at the gym, on the trail, or even in the hot tub thanks to their hearty water resistance and sport-ready fit. They're light on extras like noise canceling but at this price they're a great investment as your go-to workout companions.

Samsung's Galaxy Buds2 Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are some of our favorite wireless earbuds, particularly for Android users. They work best with Samsung phones, but they pair easily with any Android phone. They have solid noise cancelling, up to 7.5 hours of battery life, and a wireless charging case to keep them topped off.

Sony LinkBuds Photograph: Sony

Another deal we're tracking live that is making a triumphant return after going dark, the SonyLinkbuds (8/10, WIRED Recommends) have a unique design with a hole in the middle, which allows the wearer to hear what's going on around them. The earbuds have a comfortable fit, even for small ears, and we like the various control options in the companion app and on the headphones themselves. For a more traditional design, check out the Sony LinkBuds S on sale for $130 ($70 off). That deal is available at Best Buy, Amazon, and Target.

This massive tube of sound is JBL's answer to the modern boombox, offering powerful performance with booming bass in a waterproof design that lasts for a full day on a charge. If you're looking to rock a party outdoors, and you don't mind making a hefty investment, this is the speaker to get and the time to get it. It's been selling for $500 on Amazon since March.

Bose's Soundlink Revolve+ offers excellent sound in a neat and water-resistant design with up to 17 hours of battery on hand. Normally sitting well above $300, this is the best time to grab this powerful portable.

PC and Gaming Deals

Alienware AW3423DW Photograph: Dell

This gaming monitor is expensive, and it doesn't go on sale very often. The Alienware AW3423DWF (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is sublime near-perfection. It's featured as a luxury gaming pick in our guide to the Best Monitors. The image quality and colors are top-notch, and the responsive, immersive screen makes for a fantastic gaming experience. Our review has more details, but suffice it to say that if you're looking for a curved monitor, it's hard to beat this one.

This is WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu's favorite portable monitor. It's a great second screen that doesn't take up any desk space, but it does require sticking adhesive magnets onto your laptop. It's best suited for 13- to 14-inch laptops and is best for apps like Slack rather than anything that needs crisp colors. It drops to this price often, but is still a good deal.

This keyboard is a runner-up in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. It mimics the MacBook keyboard with a Do Not Disturb key, and the ability to program the function row key with Apple's own apps like Final Cut Pro, Photos, Safari, and more, using the Logi Options+ app—in addition to other Mac-specific shortcuts. It's only available with Tactile Quiet switches, but these are ideal if you typically work around other people and don’t want to disturb them.

The newest version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III just came out. The PlayStation 5 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) regularly sells for $500, so this bundle essentially gets you the game for free. It's a better deal than buying the two separately. Be sure to check out our guide to the Best PlayStation 5 Accessories and our guide to setting up your new PS5 for additional recommendations.

Photograph: Sony

This is a price match of the discounts we've seen on other shopping holidays. It's still a good deal on an excellent controller, and the price extends to several different color options. Our favorite part about the DualSense controller is the way the haptic feedback works. Rather than random rumbles, you'll feel directional and immersive feedback—almost like surround sound, but in a controller. Read more about it in our guide to the Best PlayStation 5 Accessories.

This deal just came back. The Turtle Beach Recon Cloud is an honorable mention in our Best Mobile Gaming Controllers guide. We've seen it drop to $25 before, but this is still a good deal price. The Xbox-branded controller supports Xbox Cloud Gaming and Remote Play, plus it's compatible with Android and Windows devices. Programmable buttons and customizable sensitivity settings are a plus.

With an ultralight design that features a semitransparent lighting scheme, this mouse is gorgeous, and its buttons are unbelievably snappy. They offer sharp, rich clicks for your gaming sessions. It has a place in our Best Gaming Mouse guide, and we have never seen it with such a deep discount before.

Sonos Deals

Our guide to the Best Sonos Speakers may be of use if you need help deciding which model is right for you. We've also have a full article with all the Cyber Monday Sonos deals.

Sonos Ray Photograph: Sonos

The Sonos Ray (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is an excellent soundbar for an apartment or small room. It's compact, allowing you to place it on your entertainment center or dresser. If you want to free up space, mount it on your wall. In terms of sound quality, it delivers clear, crisp sound that will easily fill your space. You can adjust the settings via the Sonos app for the best listening experience.

The Arc (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite soundbar for big home theaters. It comes equipped with three tweeters and eight mid-woofers to deliver deep bass, along with full Dolby Atmos support that can bounce sound off walls and ceilings in a way that mimics a surround sound setup. It has a tasteful and understated design too, so it won't get in the way of your interior aesthetic. This soundbar was on sale for the same price during holiday sales last year, but it's the lowest we've tracked.

We recommend the Sonos Sub (Gen 3) if your giftee wants to upgrade their bass. The third-gen model packs better processing power and more memory. It's also meant to be paired with Sonos' non-portable options—like soundbars, speakers, and amplifiers (it won't pair with the Move, Roam, Port, or Connect). It's expensive, but top-notch. This is also the lowest price we've tracked so far.

Sonos Era 100 Photograph: Sonos

The Era 100 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) holds the title of Best Overall Sonos Speaker in our guide for its improved sound and features over the Sonos One (Gen 2). It has large woofers and angled tweeters for real stereo sound, a punchier bass, and a crisp definition. With a faster processor, the speaker also receives software updates for longer. There's also now a volume slider, a play-pause button (so you don't have to take your phone out to control it), a USB-C input, and a switch on the back to manually disable the mic.

The Amp is a great option for those looking for an amplifier to power their turntable, TV, outdoor speakers, and more at higher volumes. The front control panel is touch-sensitive, so you can either tap or swipe for things like pausing music and adjusting the volume. The Amp also connects via the Sonos app and comes with support for AirPlay 2. It doesn't come with built-in mics, but you'll have voice control if you pair it with another Sonos voice-enabled speaker like the Sonos One or Sonos Move.

While the Amp powers speakers, the Port streams to an amp that then sends a signal to the speakers. Unlike the Amp, it doesn't come with a control panel, but you can use the Sonos app to adjust treble, bass, and volume. It also has support for AirPlay 2. As with the Amp, you can also pair it with other Sonos speakers for voice control.

The Beam (Gen 2) packs a ton of upgrades from its predecessor including a slight redesign (Sonos swapped the fabric cover on the front with a polycarbonate grille), enhanced sound with support for Dolby Atmos (with compatible TVs and streaming apps), a faster processor, and an HDMI eARC port for higher-definition audio. It packs support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and AirPlay 2 as well. For surround sound, you can also pair it with a Sonos Sub (an expensive subwoofer) and two other Sonos speakers.

The Sub Mini (8/10, WIRED Review) is tiny, but you can count on it to deliver a thumping bass and clear sound. It's wireless too. Aside from plugging it into your power source, it pairs with your system through the Sonos app. This is also what you'll use to fine-tune the subwoofer. You can set bass and treble levels, adjust sub and height audio, set volume limits, and add surround sound speakers.

Sonos Roam Photograph: Sonos

This is the smallest and most portable speaker Sonos offers. Equipped with Bluetooth connectivity, you can throw the Roam (9/10, WIRED Recommends) in your bag and play music on the go. It doesn't pack audiophile-approved sound for its size, but it still sounds fairly impressive. The dual-driver system, tweeter, and subwoofer work together to deliver a bold bass and clear highs (with zero distortion at high volume). You'll have to use the Sonos app to control it but you can also stream from major services like Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal, and more.

This isn't the latest version of the Sonos Move (the company released a second-gen model back in September), but we recommend it regardless. It's also almost half the cost of the Move 2. The first-gen Move packs Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, 11 hours of battery life, built-in microphones with support for Google Assistant or Alexa, and Automatic Trueplay (which equalizes audio depending on the environment). It's dipped this low a few times before, but it's still a good deal.

The Sonos Roam SL is another lightweight, portable speaker. It packs everything we love about the standard Roam, including great sound quality, 10 hours of battery life, an IP67 dust- and water-resistance rating, and Bluetooth connectivity. But it doesn't come with microphones. So, you won't have access to voice control or smart assistants. It's missing Automatic Trueplay tuning as well (a feature that listens to your space and equalizes the audio to deliver the best sound possible). If you care about privacy or you think the Roam is too expensive, this is a solid choice.

Smart Home and Kitchen Deals

Read our Best Video Doorbells and Best Smart Displays guide for more recommendations.

Google Nest Hub Max Photograph: Best Buy

The Google Nest Hub Max (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite smart display for a lot of reasons—the 10-inch touchscreen display, the solid speakers, and the camera features, to name a few. It also doubles beautifully as a digital photo frame if you're a Google Photos user.

Google makes some of the best smart displays. This second-gen Nest Hub (7/10, WIRED Recommends) doesn't have a camera, so you have some privacy and peace of mind. It's compact with a 7-inch screen, which makes it ideal for your bedside table. It has sleep-sensing tech to track your sleep quality.

The Echo Show 5 is typically overpriced at $90, but the deal price of $40 matches the best we have tracked. Just keep in mind that it goes on sale quite frequently. We prefer the Echo Show 10 for its larger size, but the smaller footprint of the Echo Show 5 is good for a nightstand or tiny kitchen.

This owl or dragon-colored, Alexa-powered, smart speaker is our favorite speaker for kids, and it opens up a world of music, audiobooks, and kid-friendly content. You get a year of Amazon Kids+ (usually $3 per month), it's easy to configure via the parent dashboard, and it can serve as a regular Bluetooth speaker. Just bear in mind that it is internet-connected and has a microphone. Older kids will likely prefer the Amazon Echo (8/10, WIRED recommends), also on sale for $55 ($45 off). They have been this low before.

Nest Video Doorbell Photograph: Google

This is a price match of the deals we saw on Prime Day. The Nest Video Doorbell is our favorite smart doorbell. Its reliable performance and solid video resolution place it far and above other similarly priced options.

Nanoleaf's beautiful wall panels are eye-catching but usually pricey. While this isn't a spectacular discount, it's still a good sale to jump on if you've got the wall space for these hexagonal wall panels. It was $10 higher than this earlier in the week. Use that $50 to shop around the rest of Nanoleaf's range of smart lights.

Nanoleaf Lines Wall Lights Photograph: Nanoleaf

These modular smart lighting bars can be installed on your wall and arranged into whatever design you want (just make sure you prep and plan properly). The Nanoleaf Lines (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are great for subtle ambient light, but they can also sync to music or even mirror your screen to add immersion to gaming. This is the cheapest we have seen this starter kit.

This is an expansion pack, so it's only worth buying if you already own the required controller and PSU sold with the brand's Shapes Kits. But if you do already have some Nanoleaf Shapes, this is a solid price for some more light-up panels.

The Cync Indoor Camera (9/10, WIRED Recommends) was one of the first to offer a privacy shutter that covers the lens when you're home or don't want to record. It also captures 1080p video at 25 frames-per-second, offers two-way audio, and accepts a microSD card (sold separately) for local storage (you can also subscribe for cloud storage from $3 per month). It is top of our Best Indoor Security Cameras guide, and this is as low as we've seen it go.

Photograph: Delonghi

A good budget espresso machine is a rare find, but this one is our favorite. You'll get a solid portafilter, a reliable steam pump, and a steaming wand in a pretty compact body. Unlike other cheap machines we tried, the Stilosa didn't show signs of slowing down.

This coffee grinder is the best one you'll find with a built-in scale. Set your grind size, select the weight you want, hit Start, and walk away; it shuts itself off when it's done. It's easier than using a kitchen scale and makes better use of limited counter space.

This vacuum and mop combo from iRobot is best for those with hardwood floors, where it can vacuum and mop at will. It offers several top features, including a self-emptying base and charging station, and this is the lowest price we've seen it reach yet.

The Roomba helped create the robot vacuum revolution and this model is one of its most affordable ways to get in on the movement, including mopping capabilities. With an original price of $350, the i5 has dropped well below $300, making now a great time to pounce.

Therabody Theragun Photograph: Theragun

Therabody has discounted a bunch of its massage guns, including this brand-new budget model. It feels cheaper than the rest of the lineup and comes with fewer attachments, but it still works well if you want to try the brand without paying for all the extra bells and whistles.

Here's one more deal that has been in and out on our tracking, which you'll want to nab now before the hordes snatch them up. The 5.5-quart bowl capacity can handle big batches of holiday cookies, dinner rolls, and other goodies. </textarea>
