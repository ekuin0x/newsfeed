                <textarea id="text" readonly> Marcus Tavernier fired a double as Bournemouth dismantled Sheffield United to maintain their resurgence under Andoni Iraola.

Tavernier struck early in both halves, his brace sandwiching Justin Kluivert’s first Premier League goal. Substitute Oli McBurnie headed a stoppage-time consolation for the Blades, who remain in the relegation zone after a 10th defeat in 13 league games.

Bournemouth, high on confidence after a 2-0 win over Newcastle in their previous game, cruised to their first league win on the road this season and the margin of victory could easily have been wider.

After seeing his side sweep the Blades aside, Iraola was delighted with Tavernier’s contribution.

He said: “He was playing really well in the last games but he had some chances he didn’t finish, against Burnley and Newcastle.

“But it was a matter of time because he has the quality. It’s good he gets the reward because he is contributing in such different ways to the team. I’m really happy for him.”

Tavernier, who missed the first month of the campaign through injury, scored five Premier League goals last season.

With Dominic Solanke scoring six times this season and Kluivert – son of former Netherlands striker Patrick – notching his first goal for the club, Iraola saluted his side’s all-round offensive threat.

“I think we have talent there, I think we have goals there, behind Dom. We were having the chances.

They were not scoring the goals before and I think it is good for them confidence-wise to come here and to score in such an important game.”

Bournemouth took the lead in the 12th minute when Antoine Semenyo cut in from the right and his ball into the box found Tavernier, who evaded his marker with a neat first touch before burying a shot under goalkeeper Wes Foderingham.

Sheffield United then added to their own problems by gifting Bournemouth a second in first-half stoppage time. Foderingham was dispossessed on the edge of the box by Kluivert, who then steered the ball into an empty net and Paul Heckingbottom acknowledged his side’s performance levels had dropped.

“Yeah, that’s been the topic of conversation in there,” the United manager said. “If we give goals away like that we’re not going to win games in this league, we know that.

“We started poorly and never really recovered. We can’t hide behind mistakes, though, we need to play better than that and get it out of our heads before the next game.”

The home side were booed off at the interval and fans vented their frustration again six minutes after the restart when Bournemouth added a third goal. Adam Smith clipped in an excellent cross from the right when left unopposed and Tavernier ghosted in at the far post to sidefoot home.

James McAtee fired wide for the Blades following a goalmouth scramble but Bournemouth threatened to add to their tally.

Foderingham kept out further efforts from Semenyo, Kluivert, Ryan Christie and substitute Luis Sinisterra while tempers flared in the 69th minute, with George Baldock, Jack Robinson and Bournemouth substitute Philip Billing all booked after a melee.

McBurnie’s late header was scant consolation for United, who face bottom club Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday, and Heckingbottom added: “We’re going to have moments in this league, we are not stupid enough to know we will be at our best every week.

“But we have to try. We have to quickly get this out of our heads for Burnley next week.” </textarea>
