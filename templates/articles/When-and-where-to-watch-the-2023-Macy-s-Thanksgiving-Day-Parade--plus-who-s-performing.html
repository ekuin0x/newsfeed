                <textarea id="text" readonly> The 97th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is rounding the corner and promising more festivities in 2023.

The annual holiday tradition will start 30 minutes early this year on the streets of New York City, with Grammy- and Oscar-winning musician Jon Batiste kicking off the event.

"Today" show anchors Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb and Al Roker will return to host this year. TV personalities Carlos Adyan and Andrea Meza are slated to host the simulcast on Telemundo.
