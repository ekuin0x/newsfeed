                <textarea id="text" readonly> Liverpool star Darwin Nunez and Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola were involved in a heated post-match spat in the aftermath of their 1-1 draw at the Etihad on Saturday afternoon.

The two Premier League giants could not be separated as Erling Haaland gave the Premier League champions the lead in the first-half, before Trent Alexander-Arnold equalised late on to secure a point for the Reds.

Immediately after the full-time whistle, Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp were seen shaking hands following the draw.

But Nunez, 24, appeared to have been infuriated by City boss as he went over to the Spaniard - with the pair being involved in an animated exchange of words.

Klopp needed to pull the Liverpool forward away from the Spaniard - and it remains unclear what triggered the heated exchange between the pair.

Peter Drury, who was on commentary duty for the match, reacted to the spat as it happened, saying: 'There are apparently some unpleasant words being exchanged.

'Darwin Nunez involved in a spiky exchange with Pep Guardiola. They needed separation.'

Haaland gave City the lead in the first-half - a record-breaking strike strike that saw him smash Andy Cole's record to become the fastest player to hit fifty Premier League goals.

The Norwegian sensation's well-taken opener against the Reds continues his sensational form since joining Manchester City for Â£51m in 2022.

Erling Haaland stole the show by becoming the quickest player to reach 50 league goals

Trent Alexander-Arnold equalised for Jurgen Klopp's side, who are now one point behind City

He pulled off the feat in just 48 appearances in the league, - with Manchester United icon Cole doing so in 65 matches.

Man City were ultimately pegged back by Liverpool as Alexander-Arnold ensured his side took a point with a stunning strike.

Despite the draw at home to Klopp's side, City remain top of the league as it stands. Mikel Arteta's Arsenal could go top with a win over Brentford this evening.

As for Liverpool, Klopp's side sit second and are a point behind the champions. The Merseyside outfit host LASK on Thursday before facing Fulham at Anfield in their next league outing. </textarea>
