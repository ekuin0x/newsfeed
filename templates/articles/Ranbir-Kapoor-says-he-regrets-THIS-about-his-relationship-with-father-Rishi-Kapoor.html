                <textarea id="text" readonly> Ranbir Kapoor is gearing up for the release of his next, ' Animal ' which sees him share screen space with Anil Kapoor, Bobby Deol and Rashmika Mandanna. If one goes by the film's trailer, then 'Animal' is a film about a father-son relationship in its core. Ranbir becomes violent and he wants to do everything for his father's validation and to shine in his eyes.Since the film is about a father-son relationship, Ranbir spoke about his personal life and the relationship he shared with his father Rishi Kapoor .The team of 'Animal' attended an event for the film in Hyderabad and during the event, Ranbir spoke about his late father. "I lost my father in the last few years and I think everyone who loses a parent, they always feel they never spent enough time with them.”He further confessed the one thing he regrets about his relationship with his father. "While I was growing up, my father was very busy, he was shooting most of the time, double shifts-triple shifts he was traveling everywhere so somewhere we’ve always seen him with a lot of love and respect but there was not a really friendly relationship between us. We couldn’t just sit and chat, and I really have that one regret in my life I wish I could be friends with my father. I wish I could share more with him, which is one regret I always live with.”Rishi Kapoor passed away in 2020 after battling with Leukemia for 2 years. Ranbir had shared screen space with his father Rishi Kapoor only in one film 'Besharam' which also starred Neetu Singh.'Animal' is set to release on December 1. </textarea>
