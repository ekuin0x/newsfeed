                <textarea id="text" readonly> (NEXSTAR) – It’s been estimated that the average American eats approximately 60 burgers per year. And if that sounds high, it’s likely because most of those burgers weren’t so memorable.

To rectify this issue, Yelp’s analysts recently set out to determine the “top” cheeseburger restaurant in every state using data obtained from Yelp’s community of online reviewers. The final list features something for folks in all corners of the country, from the meaty shores of Myrtle Beach to the cheesy plains of Wichita and beyond.

Considering Yelp was able to find the “top” cheeseburger joint in each state, it would stand to reason that one of the above eateries would rank highest in the country — and that eatery is Au Cheval in Chicago, a representative for Yelp confirmed to Nexstar. A bar/diner on the city’s West Side, Au Cheval is noted on Yelp for specializing in craft cocktails, late-night bites and deceptively named cheeseburgers (the single cheeseburger has two patties, and the double has three).

Still, every eatery on the list earned high marks for its cheeseburgers, each of which is very likely to be more memorable than the 50 or so you’ve probably already eaten this calendar year.
