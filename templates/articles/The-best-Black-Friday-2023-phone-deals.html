                <textarea id="text" readonly> If you’ve been putting off a new phone purchase all year, then I have great news: your procrastination is about to pay off. Black Friday has officially arrived with some excellent deals in tow — think Pixels, iPhones, and Galaxy devices for hundreds of dollars below MSRP. And even if you picked up a new phone recently, it’s a great time to stock up on some new cases, chargers, and accessories. And when you’re done looking at phones, you can check out our entire Black Friday roundup.

The best deals on phone chargers, cases, and accessories

Maybe you heard, but Apple’s new FineWoven case isn’t our favorite. Consider a Moment case instead for your new iPhone 15 — they’re $34.99 right now, which is $15 off the full MSRP.

instead for your new iPhone 15 — they’re $34.99 right now, which is $15 off the full MSRP. Another option: Nomad is offering 30 percent off sitewide, so its $50 leather iPhone 15 case is $35 right now.

is $35 right now. Moft’s Snap Case and handy wallet / stand accessory are $58.99 for the pair, down from $69.99.

are $58.99 for the pair, down from $69.99. It might be your last chance to pick up the discontinued MagSafe Duo iPhone and Apple Watch wireless charger — it’s $79.99 at Woot, down from its $129.99 original price. It’s definitely not the cheapest way to charge your phone wirelessly, but it’s a surprisingly good travel charger.

The best deals on iPhones

Apple is offering a $75 gift card with the purchase of an iPhone 13, iPhone 14, or iPhone SE. The iPhone 13 is a particularly good deal since it should have several more years of OS upgrades ahead of it, and its discounted $599 price is already a good value. Read our review.

Apple iPhone 13 $ 580 $ 730 21 % off $ 580 $ 580 $ 730 21 % off With the introduction of the iPhone 15, Apple lowered the price on the 13 to $599. If you’re paying upfront rather than subsidizing your purchase with a carrier, then it’s a great option. $599 at Apple$580 at Best Buy

iPhone SE (2022) $ 424 The 2022 iPhone SE will last for over five years if it’s taken care of, thanks to Apple’s excellent track record of offering iOS updates to older devices. But its tiny 4.7-inch screen feels cramped now and may be tough to use in five years’ time while apps and webpages continue to be designed for bigger screens. $429 at Apple$424 at Amazon

Best Google Pixel phone deals

Google didn’t hold back on this year’s Black Friday deals. The Pixel 8 and 8 Pro are barely a month old, but they’re subject to some significant discounts. And if you were eyeing a Pixel Fold, now might be the time — at $1,400 it’s a better offer than at its $1,700 MSRP.

Google Pixel 8 $ 549 $ 699 21 % off $ 549 $ 549 $ 699 21 % off The Pixel 8 comes with just a couple of key upgrades over the Pixel 7, and it misses out on several higher-end features on the 8 Pro, like a telephoto lens. But its combination of price, features, and the promise of seven years of OS updates makes it the best mainstream Android phone to buy right now. $549 at Google Store$549 at Amazon$549 at Best Buy

Best Samsung Galaxy phone deals

Samsung is offering deals across the board on its S23 series phones, which will likely be replaced at the beginning of 2024. But even with a successor on the horizon, $899 for the Galaxy S23 Ultra is an awfully good deal. Take a look at the healthy discounts on Samsung’s folding phones, too.

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 (256GB, unlocked) $ 1000 $ 1799 44 % off $ 1000 $ 1000 $ 1799 44 % off Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 5 looks a lot like its predecessor, but it now folds flat thanks to a new hinge with fewer moving parts. It maintains the 7.6-inch inner display and narrow 6.2-inch cover screen, but it now utilizes the same Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor found in Samsung’s Galaxy S23 phones. $1000 at Best Buy$1299 at Amazon

Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 (256GB) $ 799 $ 999 20 % off $ 799 $ 799 $ 999 20 % off Samsung’s Z Flip 5 is its latest 6.7-inch flip phone that folds in half, now sporting a larger front cover display and a new hinge design that allows it to close flat. Inside, it packs a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a dual-camera setup. $799 at Amazon$800 at Best Buy

Samsung Galaxy S23 (128GB) $ 700 $ 799 12 % off $ 700 $ 700 $ 799 12 % off Samsung’s Galaxy S23 phone maintains a 6.1-inch screen like its predecessor, but it now has a brighter panel with a stronger Gorilla Glass covering for improved drop protection. Design-wise, it eschews the camera bump around its three rear cameras, and it also has a bigger battery than the S22. $700 at Amazon$700 at Best Buy

Best Motorola phone deals

Motorola’s Razr Plus flip phone is an awful lot of fun, and with a 30 percent discount, it’s a tempting offer. The company’s flagship-status 2023 Edge Plus falls a little short of the offerings from Google and Samsung when considering its full $799 price, but at a 26 percent discount, it makes much more sense.

Best OnePlus phone deals

The OnePlus 11 is seemingly out of stock everywhere in its cheaper 128GB variant, but the 256GB version is marked down to a thoroughly reasonable $630. The Nord N30 has its share of budget phone problems, but its Black Friday markdown brings it well under $300.

OnePlus 11 5G (256GB) $ 630 $ 800 21 % off $ 630 $ 630 $ 800 21 % off The OnePlus 11 lacks a couple of key features, namely robust water resistance and wireless charging. But its big 6.7-inch screen, excellent performance, and fast wired charging are all quite appealing at its relatively low price. $630 at OnePlus$630 at Amazon

OnePlus Nord N30 5G $ 230 $ 300 23 % off $ 230 $ 230 $ 300 23 % off With a price around $300, the N30 is squarely a budget phone. It offers snappy performance that’s hard to find elsewhere in the class, though the lower-contrast LCD is a downgrade from the OLED panel on last year’s N20. $230 at OnePlus$230 at Best Buy
