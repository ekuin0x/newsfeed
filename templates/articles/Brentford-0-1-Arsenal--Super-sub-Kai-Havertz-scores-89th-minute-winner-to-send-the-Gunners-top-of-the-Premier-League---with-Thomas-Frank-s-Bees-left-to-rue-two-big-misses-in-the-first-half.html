                <textarea id="text" readonly> Mikel Arteta had Kai Havertz in a headlock as he dragged him towards the away section. He wanted the 24-year-old German described as a £65million puzzle central to the celebrations.

The debate surrounding where Havertz should be used will continue – hell, Germany even tried him as a left back in the international break – but the back post seemed as nice a place as any for him to be positioned when Bukayo Saka crossed in the 89th minute.

Havertz' header was enough to send Arsenal to the top of the Premier League for the first time this season.

Above Manchester City. Above Liverpool. Above Tottenham. Above everyone.

Arteta may claim he does not pay too much attention to the table in November, but this brought him immense satisfaction on his 200th match as Arsenal manager.

Arsenal's Kai Havertz scored an 89th minute winner to defeat Brentford 1-0 on Saturday night

The goal sends Arsenal top of the Premier League table, leapfrogging Manchester City and Liverpool after their 1-1 draw earlier on Saturday lunchtime at the Etihad Stadium

Brentford kept Arsenal quiet for most of the match and almost came close in the first half, with Declan Rice clearing off the line after a mistake from goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale (right)

Naturally at full-time, they were congratulations galore for Havertz. Yet plenty of pats on back were reserved for Aaron Ramsdale, too, as Arsenal's players swarmed their returning team-mate.

At times it was uncomfortable to watch Ramsdale, like we were all witnessing a goalkeeper with the yips in a challenging first half. You can only hope the securing of a clean sheet will give him confidence for his next appearance, whenever that may be.

It took less than a minute for Brentford's supporters to taunt Ramsdale.

'S*** David Raya,' they sang at Arsenal's second-choice goalkeeper. 'You're just a s*** David Raya.'

Raya was ineligible for this game against his parent club, meaning Ramsdale was handed his first Premier League start in nearly three months.

The 25-year-old Englishman was shaky from the start and, considering he is from Stoke-on-Trent, we cannot blame that entirely on his decision to wear short sleeves on such a wintry evening in west London.

Ramsdale was expected to pass out from the back as if he had never been away from the Arsenal line-up. Yet in the 13th minute, this caused chaos.

A goal-kick taken short left Ramsdale in possession, all too aware that Brentford's Yoane Wissa was sprinting to close him down.

Ramsdale panicked as Wissa won the ball before teeing up Bryan Mbeumo.

Brentford thought the striker who has been magnificent in filling in for the banned Ivan Toney had a gift of a goal. But the instinctive Declan Rice retreated to the line to stop Mbeumo from opening the scoring.

From then on, whenever Ramsdale had the ball at his feet, Brentford's supporters piled on the pressure.

As is the Thomas Frank way when facing one of the Premier League's big teams, he fielded a back three.

Ethan Pinnock has arguably been Brentford's best player this season at the heart of their defence and Arsenal found it difficult to break them down.

Havertz sealed the win after questions had been raised over the amount of goals he has scored this season for Arsenal, heading in past Mark Flekken

Brentford had chances during the match, with Bryan Mbuemo coming close in the first half

Arsenal could have gone a goal up just before half time when Leandro Trossard had a goal disallowed for offside

The visitors had a few chances.

In the 25th minute, Leandro Trossard should have done better when Oleksandr Zinchenko's cross found him unmarked.

In the 30th, Gabriel Jesus tried a turn by the six-yard box. On another day, he might have scored. On this day, Pinnock was there to block.

Then, it all went wrong for Ramsdale again. He tried to throw the ball upfield to a team-mate, but tossed it into the ground instead.

With two bloopers to his name, the Arsenal goalkeeper will not endure many first halves as testing as this.

The only saving grace was it remained goalless and in the 41st minute, Arsenal were celebrating taking the lead. Saka's cross led to a Jesus header which Mark Flekken palmed upward. Trossard rushed to head home as it dropped down.

'We are top of the league,' sang the visiting supporters, not realising VAR Michael Salisbury was primed to spoil their party from Stockley Park. One line was drawn to the goalscorer's foot and another to the ball. Trossard was ahead of it and therefore offside.

It was a hard-fought win for the Gunners, who are now undefeated in their last two matches

It was also Mikel Arteta's 200th match as the Arsenal manager, much to the Spaniard's delight

As the half-time whistle was blown, Arsenal goalkeeping coach Inaki Cana ran on to reassure Ramsdale.

It became noticeable in the second half that Ramsdale routinely reverted to playing long passes rather than risk tiki-taka in his own box. A wise move.

Brentford were unbeaten in their last 14 London derbies in the Premier League. In truth, Arsenal rarely looked like scoring in the second half.

In the 77th minute, Brentford hoped they had scored when Neal Maupay's header was bound for the bottom corner, only for yet another goal-line clearance to thwart them. This time it was Zinchenko who slid to make sure it stayed 0-0.

It did not stay that scoreline for long, however. In the 89th minute, there was a sucker-punch from Arsenal.

Saka crossed to the back post where Havertz was perfectly placed to head home the winner. He needed that. As did his team. Arsenal are top. Back where they want to be. </textarea>
