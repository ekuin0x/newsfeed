                <textarea id="text" readonly> Five people have died following a devastating avalanche on a 13,000 ft mountain in Iran.

The incident on the Oshtoran Kuh mountain occurred after climbers were warned by local authorities of extreme weather conditions, also left four injured.

Heavy rain and snow has hit the San Boran peak, the highest point in the area, in the last few weeks.

Survivors who were discovered on Friday who had started climbing the mountain in Lorestan, 180 miles south west of the capital Tehran, the previous day were taken to hospital.

Five bodies were left missing by the landslide, two of which were found on Friday and three on Saturday afternoon, the Sun reported.

Bodies of five mountaineers have so far been found following the deadly avalanche

Footage posted by Iranian Red Crescent showed rescuers working to locate bodies and free any survivors from the snow.

Despite being a relatively uncommon occurrence in Iran, an avalanche north of Tehran previously claimed twelve lives in 2020.

The fatal incident comes just months after a similar event on the Armancette glacier on Mont Blanc in the French Alps, which saw six victims killed after being caught in a 1,600m high snowslide.

Another deadly avalanche in India killed seven people after a bus full of tourists crashed into a gorge during a landslide which hit five or six vehicles. </textarea>
