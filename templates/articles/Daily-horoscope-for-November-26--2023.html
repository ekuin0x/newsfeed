Questioning our assumptions could be both stressful and rewarding today. When the practical Taurus Moon meets groundbreaking Uranus, we can notice possibilities that are totally new to us but also relatively realistic. That being said, as idealistic Venus challenges Uranus at 10:49 am EST, what flows naturally will probably be a bit different from how we thought things were supposed to work. After the Moon shifts into cerebral Gemini and opposes bombastic Mars, we may begin to draw connections that contradict our beliefs.

Aries

March 21-April 19

Impressing a special person could be a high priority for you at present. Whether the connection you're trying to build is based on business or pleasure, you may feel like you need to go all out. As the nurturing Moon unites with chaotic Uranus in your resource zone, you might lose track of how much money you're spending on this effort. The potential lift to your self-confidence could be worth the sacrifice, but keep an eye on the response you're receiving.

Taurus

April 20-May 20

Relaxation could be urgently necessary for you now. As soothing Venus in your wellness sector stimulates unpredictable Uranus in your sign, you might be surprised by the thoughts and feelings that come up once you unplug. What have you been running from? Encountering inconvenient emotions may not be what you had in mind for your big day off, but they can't be suppressed forever. Let them play out instead of fighting against them -- the cloud should pass sooner than you think!

Gemini

May 21-June 20

Exploring forbidden subjects could currently be giving you a lot to think about. You may not have fully figured out your own opinions on what you're learning yet -- taking in and assimilating information can be a lot of work. However, perhaps there's a portion of it that seems manageable by now. While creative Venus in your expressive 5th house nudges unconventional Uranus in your 12th House of Secrets, consider sharing insight you've recently gained with others. Maybe it's exactly what they need to hear!

Cancer

June 21-July 22

Your friends may currently want to do something more stimulating than your usual taste. While the impulsive Moon joins revolutionary Uranus in your social sector, it's okay to accept the opportunity to venture outside your comfort zone. The point of having other people in your life is that they can think of worthwhile possibilities that wouldn't occur to you on your own. Still, follow the crowd for healthy reasons -- act from the security of knowing you have every right to choose otherwise.

Leo

July 23-August 22

You may presently feel the need to take an action that others consider disruptive. From your perspective, this path forward will have the best long-term effects, even if it causes discomfort in the moment. As appeasing Venus in your communication zone challenges polarizing Uranus in your ambitious 10th house, however, your efforts to explain won't necessarily succeed in the way you want them to. No amount of sweet talk can eliminate all pain -- you might have to live with a few aches.

Virgo

August 23-September 22

An unusual view of the world may be grabbing your curiosity today. Perhaps whatever you're learning seems to provide the answer to a problem you've been struggling with for some time. That said, when resourceful Venus in your finance sector clashes against ungrounded Uranus in your intellectual 9th house, the thought of putting your hard-earned money toward this idea could push you to clarify how realistic it is. Start with no more than a small investment -- don't go all out right away.

Libra

September 23-October 22

You might feel pushed to manage how others see you at this time. Unfortunately, while image-focused Venus in your sign conflicts with rebellious Uranus in your intimacy zone, you can't really control what anyone else says. Someone with an axe to grind could feel the need to share a story that makes you look bad. Stopping them entirely might not be possible, but they'll eventually run out of steam without a steady supply of fuel. Don't get sucked into the drama.

Scorpio

October 23-November 21

Relaxing and spending a few hours alone can genuinely nourish you. However, you're not required to stick to that plan if a more appealing opportunity arises. When the social Moon meets spontaneous Uranus in your relationship zone, you may receive an unexpected invitation to connect with someone else. If you accept, though, you might still be in your original contemplative mood. Consider sharing some of that with your companion -- they don't have to be the only one offering surprises!

Sagittarius

November 22-December 21

Connecting with others could nourish you today. Sadly, social stimulation is probably not the only valid need you have at the moment. While cheery Venus in your 11th House of Community balances against individualistic Uranus in your responsible 6th house, the demands of a work or health matter may force you to peel away from the group at some point. Be candid about what you're dealing with -- don't give anyone an opportunity to interpret your absence as a personal slight.

Capricorn

December 22-January 19

Maintaining a positive reputation could be important to you now. Even so, as pleasing Venus in your public 10th house combats personal Uranus in your self-expression sector, you might feel like you have to sacrifice too much in order to be taken seriously. Reality does have its limits, but the people you're trying to impress may be less fragile than you give them credit for. Floating a few interesting ideas can relieve your tension and get a better response than you expect!

Aquarius

January 20-February 18

Your situation at home could be frustratingly chaotic these days. While calm Venus in your travel sector contrasts with incoherent Uranus in your domestic zone, you may feel pulled to venture somewhere else to get away from it all. This isn't definitively a bad idea -- it might give you a needed break from your most pressing problems. However, any overly idealistic impression you hold that life is perfect in some other culture is likely to be shaken. Being human has its challenges anywhere!

Pisces

February 19-March 20

A fulfilling collaboration may be within your reach, but making it happen might require some courage. While peaceful Venus in your sharing sector agitates pathbreaking Uranus in your 3rd House of Communication, perhaps you're reluctant to change the existing terms of your relationship with the other person -- even if the alternative is potentially better. Don't pressure them to decide right away, and give them plenty of room to say no. The more freedom you provide, the more tempting your offer should be!
