                <textarea id="text" readonly> Kanye West has been on the receiving end of substantial backlash since the release of his latest single Vultures, which was released on Wednesday.

Now, the rapper is getting criticized for rocking and gyrating to the song alongside his collaborator Ty Dolla $ign, Chris Brown, Bump J and others at a party in Dubai, where he was reunited with his wife Bianca Censori following her recent trip to see family in Australia.

In the video, the group can be seen rocking out as the controversial line 'How I’m antisemitic? I just f**ked a Jewish b**ch,' played loudly over the speakers.

The clip has gone viral on social media and the criticism has been fast and furious.

'You are disgusting,' one upset critic wrote.

Antisemitic: Kanye West has come under fire for the controversial lyrics in in new single Vultures, which includes the line 'How I’m antisemitic? I just f**ked a Jewish bitch'

'Shame on you!!!!!!!!,' another exclaimed.

'What’s more sickening? The lyrics… Or the fact that both Kanye West and @chrisbrownofficial find it hysterical?,' penned one angry commenter.

Referring to Chris Brown's notorious attack on Rihanna in 2009, one enraged critic wrote, 'Chris Brown an abuser and Kanye West a psychotic narcissistic self-proclaimed mastermind.'

Late last year, Kanye saw his career fall apart after a string of antisemitic outbursts, including a vow to go 'death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE.'

In October 2022, shortly after that tweet, the Praise God rapper told Piers Morgan he only meant to take aim at certain specific Jews, who he felt exploited him.

When the talk show host contended the comments were 'as racist as anything you’ve been through,' the Gold Digger rapper retorted 'that's why I said it. I fought fire with fire.'

In an interview with right wing talk show host Alex Jones in early December, Kanye praised Hitler for his 'redeeming qualities'.

He also maintained that the 'Holocaust is not what happened' and promoted the conspiracy theory that Black people are the real Jews.

Career damage: Late last year, Kanye saw his career fall apart after a string of antisemitic outbursts, resulting the hitmaker losing his lucrative contracts with The Gap, Adidas and Balenciaga and more

The consequences of these statements were that the hitmaker lost his lucrative contracts with The Gap, Adidas and Balenciaga and more.

He was also dropped by his management team at Creative Artists Agency.

In spite of the controversy, many of Kanye's fans have been happy to support the rapper and the new release.

Comments such as 'Love all the way Ye ❤️' and 'It’s nice seeing Yeeee smiling again,' were also posted next to clips of the video. </textarea>
