                <textarea id="text" readonly> "The Game" will be a little different this season.

Both teams are undefeated and at the top of the college football world, that part is the same. But when No. 2 Ohio State faces No. 3 Michigan in the Big House in Ann Arbor, the Wolverines will be without head coach Jim Harbaugh, who is serving a suspension for his role in the program's sign stealing scandal.

Still, the matchup will have massive implications for the Big Ten and for the hierarchy of the College Football Playoff, overall. Since both teams play in the Big Ten East, the winner of the game will have the inside track to represent the division in the conference championship game, which will take place Dec. 2 in Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.
