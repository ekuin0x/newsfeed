In politics they call it “working across the aisle” -- the tricky dance of cooperation between rival parties aimed to keep business rolling along. A square of Mars and Saturn suggests negotiation and compromise will be necessary to progress. A show of respect can set the right tone, though don’t lay down arms completely. Keep your own interests in sight.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). You’ve chased something that doesn’t want to be caught. You reach, it runs. Now it’s time for a different strategy. Instead of chasing, build your lure so it’s attractive to your desired catch.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). When you want what everyone wants, there will always be hurdles to jump and competition to outrun. Luckily, your current desire is more unique, either because it’s a small niche, or because you are early to the trend.

AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). No matter how close you feel to another person, you are still two individuals who require a certain amount of space for well-being. Today, this amount will be mutually and magically agreed upon without mention -- that’s how in sync you are.

PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20). While the ability to see things from various perspectives is the essence of critical thinking, it can make taking decisive action a challenge. Once you get internal forces aligned, you’ll be successful.

ARIES (March 21-April 19). Limitations spark creativity. So, while dealing with inconvenient rules, strict deadlines and difficult collaborators is no fun, such annoyances will bring about your best work and most innovative solutions.

TAURUS (April 20-May 20). You’re so used to being you that sometimes you forget what makes you special. What you do out of curiosity, love and sheer initiative is so unique. Keep track so you can remind yourself when you need a lift.

GEMINI (May 21-June 21). Some jobs come complete with performance metrics that you can measure your work by, but most jobs require you to come up with your own bars to hit. You’ll decide what matters and self-assess.

CANCER (June 22-July 22). Chasing many outcomes at once would makes your progress undetectable on all fronts, which is hard on morale. This may be unavoidable today with your wide-ranging responsibilities and interests. So, take heart, and continue in faith.

LEO (July 23-Aug. 22). Since you can’t see what’s around the bend, the winding roads are both more exciting and more dangerous. Still, you’re in the mood to choose this sort of rush -- the thrill of uncertainty.

VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). Your idea will work well for everyone, if you have the means and influence to see it through. Are you willing to share the credit? Teaming up with influential contributors at this juncture could make all the difference.

LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). The task at hand is already complicated enough. Adding questions to the mix will only cause more confusion. But if you must ask, go with “How?” and steer away from “Why?” because everyone’s answer to that one will be different.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). The extremes of “bad” and “good” will not help you navigate today’s journey through gray areas. These are matters of nuance, taste, culture and personal preference. Each situation is unique, and you’ll regard it as such.

TODAY’S BIRTHDAY (Nov. 25) Welcome to the year of unyielding spirit. Your purpose is clear; your drive burns steady. Some days are small steps, others sprints, but always and ever forward until you arrive, enjoy and set the gold standard. More highlights: Many soulful encounters transpire. Relationships flourish as you execute your stellar ideas for fun and excitement. Gemini and Libra adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 12, 7, 36, 3 and 28.

CELEBRITY PROFILES: Christina Applegate is in pre-production for the comedy “Your Time Is Up” about a psychologist taking an unconventional approach to helping her clients. Applegate’s own approach to work has been unconventional in its honesty, as she advocates for breast cancer screening and multiple sclerosis awareness. Applegate’s natal Moon and Mars in spiritual Pisces suggests a tremendous capacity for empathy and a talent for healing.
