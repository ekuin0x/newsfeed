                <textarea id="text" readonly> UPDATE: Nov. 26, 2023, 7:30 a.m. EST This post has been updated to include the latest TV deals from Walmart.

Walmart has a reputation for hosting epic doorbusters this time of year, and we've been watching the best Walmart Cyber Monday TV deals closely. Already, we've seen popular discounts on budget 4K TVs from brands like TCL, Vizio, and Hisense sell out.

But with Black Friday behind us and Cyber Monday fast approaching, Walmart is getting ready to drop a fresh round of doorbuster TV deals. Walmart's confusingly timed Cyber Monday sale officially begins on Sunday, November 26 at 7 p.m. ET (with early access for Walmart+ members at 4 p.m.), but there are still plenty of lingering deals leftover from Black Friday.

This year, Walmart's TV discounts fall into two categories: Deals on budget TVs that seem impossibly affordable, and huge mark-downs on premium QLED and OLED models. Just check out this $148 50-inch 4K TV from Walmart-owned brand onn., which dropped during Walmart's first official Black Friday event of the year. It perfectly represents what you can expect to find when shopping for a TV at Walmart: the cheapest 4K TV possible at any given size between 50 inches and 70 inches. And as these cheap 4K TVs sell out, Walmart still has OLED TVs from Sony, LG, and Samsung heavily discounted.

Walmart had to come in hot after announcing its Black Friday schedule late â€” late compared to competitors like Best Buy and Samsung, who have been tagging countless TVs as Black Friday deals since Halloween.

Now, Cyber Monday deals are in full swing for everyone, with more on the way soon. Because we've been seeing TVs go in and out of stock at Walmart, if you see a deal you want, snatch it up quickly. You've been warned.

Note: All newly added deals are marked with a âœ¨, while deals with a ðŸ”¥ have dropped to an all-time low price. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.

Best 50-inch TV deal

Why we like it

Most of Walmart's budget TVs have already sold out, although keep checking back as a fresh round of Cyber Monday deals goes live Sunday evening. For now, this Samsung has the best discount.

Samsung has made some of the best premium TVs in the OLED and QLED space, but this crystal LED model is a good starter Samsung model for the rest of us. This older model TV still has some tricks up its screen. Android smartphone users can stream content from their phone to the TV, and even though it's a budget model, you can watch all your favorite streaming apps on a 4K screen.

More 43 to 50-inch TV deals at Walmart

Best 55-inch TV deal

Why we like it

The total discount on this TCL TV isn't giant, but we still think it's the best Walmart TV deal we've spotted so far. Normally, QLED TVs like this are much more expensive, and getting a 55-incher for under $350 is really rare. This TV features rich colors, is powered by Google's smart TV OS, and has special features for gamers. Plus, Walmart's been able to keep this TV doorbuster deal in stock, even as similar TV deals have sold out.

Best 65-Inch TV deal

Why we like it

As of Sunday morning, virtually all of Walmart's doorbuster TV deals in the budget category have sold out, including the most popular onn., Vizio, Hisense, and TCL models. However, if you're more interested in mid-range or premium models, there are still serious savings to be found. This Sony TV is powered by Google's smart TV OS and features a vibrant 4K display. And unlike some deals, it's a relatively recent 2022 model.

More deals on 65-inch TVs

Best Walmart deals on 75-inch TVs

Why we like it

In the budget space, TCL has been turning out the consistently best TVs since 2020. The brand makes incredibly affordable flatscreens that still have all the features you want in a smart TV. Plus, this 4K TV ups the ante with a gorgeous QLED TV. For Cyber Week at Walmart, you can take $100 off the price of this and similar TCL 75-inch TVs. Like the models featured above, it's also powered by Google OS for easy streaming.
