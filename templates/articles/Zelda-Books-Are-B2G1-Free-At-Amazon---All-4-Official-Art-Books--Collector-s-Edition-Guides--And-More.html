                <textarea id="text" readonly> The Legend of Zelda fans will want to check out Amazon's buy two, get one free Black Friday sale on books. A bunch of Zelda books, including guidebooks, art books, and manga, are eligible for this enticing promotion. There are also some great Black Friday 2023 deals on Zelda books that aren't in the B2G1 free promotion.

B2G1 free The Legend of Zelda books

Starting with the B2G1 free sale, the most compelling offer is the Tears of the Kingdom: Official Guide (Collector's Edition), which is steeply discounted to $27. Clocking in at a staggering 496 pages, it covers literally everything you'd ever want to know about the game. This includes a full walkthrough for not just the main quests but also its shrines, caves, and side adventures. Best of all, it's wrapped in a gorgeous hardcover with a striking gold and brown design.

The standard paperback guide is also on sale for $18 (down from $30) and eligible for B2G1 free. And if you don't want your Tears of the Kingdom guide to be alone on the shelf, the hardcover expanded edition of Breath of the Wild's guidebook is down to $23 and featured in the promotion.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Strategy Guides

You can also grab four official The Legend of Zelda art and history books. The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia offers in-depth look at how the many incarnations of Hyrule and its characters connect to one another. You can also pick up The Legend of Zelda Encyclopedia, which covers every game from the original through Twilight Princess HD, and the gorgeous art book The Legend of Zelda: Arts & Artifacts for roughly 50% off each.

Meanwhile, Creating a Champion explores the work that went into creating Breath of the Wild. It features a detailed history of the game's version of Hyrule and is jam-packed with sketches, concept art, and commentary from the team behind the modern classic.

Other books included in the B2G1 free sale include the Legendary edition of the Ocarina of Time manga (the first in a series) as well as multiple volumes of the long-running Twilight Princess manga. For the youngsters, there's a Zelda sticker book containing over 800 stickers.

Outside of the B2G1 free sale, you'll find big discounts on more Zelda art books and manga.

For the collectors out there, the Deluxe edition of The Legend of Zelda Encyclopedia comes with a slipcase and cover that matches the original NES game's gold cartridge. The Hero's edition of Creating a Champion is also on sale.

And if you're interested in Zelda manga, the Legendary Edition box set, which comes in a treasure chest, is on sale for only $80 and includes the whole manga run in five gorgeous hardcover volumes.

Plenty of other books beyond the world of Zelda are included in Amazon's B2G1 free sale. Check out our big roundup of manga, graphic novels, art books, and books. If you're only interested in manga, we have lists focused on box sets and Berserk. And if you want to stick with Nintendo, The Art of Super Mario Odyssey is included in the promotion, too. </textarea>
