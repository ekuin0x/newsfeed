Alienware AW3423DW Photograph: Dell

This OLED gaming monitor is expensive, and it doesn't go on sale very often. The Alienware AW3423DW (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is sublime near-perfection. It's featured as a luxury gaming pick in our Best Monitors guide. The image quality and colors are top-notch, and the responsive, immersive screen makes for a fantastic gaming experience. Our review has more details, but suffice it to say that if you're looking for a curved monitor, it's hard to beat this one.

If you need color accuracy in a monitor, this BenQ is a great choice. WIRED senior editor Michael Calore says this BenQ is one of the best choices for creative professionals like graphic designers, photographers, and video editors. It has great accuracy out of the box. Plus, the stand is height-adjustable and can swivel to vertical mode.

We named this one as our favorite budget gaming monitor, thanks to its 1440p LCD TFT display and 165-Hz refresh rate (with AMD FreeSync support), although it lacks HDR support. For anyone with an eye on value, this Dell should deliver smooth performance (if your computer can power it) without breaking your piggy bank wide open.

This is a well-built monitor that lasts, while still being affordable. WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu has used it for years, and it's still serving him well. The price on this screen often dips under $100; this is a few dollars lower than usual.

This LG monitor is perfect for gamers. It comes equipped with a 160Hz refresh rate, HDR, and AMD FreeSync Premium to reduce tearing for buttery-smooth gaming. If you've been looking for a big gaming screen, this is a pretty sweet deal.

This mid-sized monitor from LG's Ultragear series delivers vibrant colors, ultra-fast response, and a 144Hz max refresh rate for smooth gameplay. At $200, it won't break the bank either.

LG DualUp 28-Inch 2K Vertical Monitor Photograph: LG

Nearly any monitor can be rotated to be a vertical monitor, and we love them for a work-from-home setup. However, the LG DualUp is made to be vertical and comes with a wider aspect ratio (16:18) to accommodate its upright lifestyle. You'll see less content cut off, and it isn't as narrow on your eyes. It also has great colors and comes with an arm mount that's easy to set up. This price is a little lower than what it usually drops to, so it's a great time to grab this pricey monitor.

Portable Monitor Deals

Mobile Pixels Duex Plus Photograph: Mobile Pixels

This is WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu's favorite portable monitor. It's a great second screen that doesn't take up any desk space, but it does require sticking adhesive magnets onto your laptop. It's best suited for 13- to 14-inch laptops and is best for apps like Slack rather than anything that needs crisp colors.

This portable display is plasticky but surprisingly compact for a 15-inch screen. It has a built-in kickstand, but its IPS display is the weakest of the portable displays we recommend in our work-from-home guide. It still gets decently bright, though, and this is a good price for a very portable display.

Are you amenable to trying out a portable monitor for your smartphone or tablet, but don't want to commit to a major purchase before dipping your toes into the water? The G1 is our favorite budget portable monitor because its 15.6-inch IPS screen has vivid colors and a 144-Hz refresh rate. There's no shortage of ports, either, with two USB-C ports, a mini HDMI, and even a headphone jacket. And to boot, it comes with a folio cover that you can use as a standâ€”typically an extra cost you'd need to buy aftermarket.

Espresso 15 Photograph: Espresso

This bundle is expensive, but Espresso makes some of the thinnest and lightest portable monitors out there. The color accuracy is excellent, and there's touchscreen functionality, even if using fingers on MacOS isn't all that great. This bundle includes the 15-inch display, a magnetic stand, a Creator screen to make the surface more paper-like, and a stylus, so you can use Espresso's new Jot software that lets you mark up almost any screen and take notes.

This MSI monitor is one of the best values in the world of portable monitors. We wish the kickstand spanned the whole back of the monitor, but it remains sturdy on a desk, has pleasant colors, and it's sharp.

Monitor Accessory Deals

Jarvis Monitor Arm Photograph: Jarvis

This monitor arm can balance up to 20 pounds and your cables, thanks to its built-in cable management. It's VESA-compatible and just as adjustable as other monitor mounts we like. There's also a version for a laptop tray or a dual monitor arm, both of which are on sale too.

This adapter is included in our guide to Best USB-C Cables. It's convenient if you want to plug your USB-C device into a monitor or TV that only accepts HDMI inputs. Provided your phone (or other USB-C gadget) supports DP (DisplayPort) Alt Mode, you can use this adapter to switch to HDMI 2.1, though you will still need an HDMI cable. It supports 8K at 30Hz or 4K at up to 144Hz. But you should definitely check compatibility before you buy. It's dipped to this price before, but we still think it's a solid deal.

Who wants to spend close to $100 for a monitor arm? WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu has had a good experience with this dual-monitor mount from Vivo. Don't expect to adjust it super freely like the Jarvis above, but it holds monitors in place (via VESA mount), and you can adjust the height and angle. It's super simple and super cheap. </textarea>
