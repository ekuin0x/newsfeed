                <textarea id="text" readonly> Ubisoft has said a “technical error” was to blame for a pop-up advert appearing in Assassin’s Creed games for some players this week.

A Reddit user uploaded the clip below, showing the unwelcome interruption popping up while they were attempting to access Assassin’s Creed Odyssey’s in-game map on Xbox Series X/S.

The advert in question was for a current Black Friday deal on the latest series entry, Assassin’s Creed Mirage.

“Can confirm,” said another Redditor in the comments section. “I got same screen on PS5 last night.”

A spokesperson for Ubisoft, which does promote other Assassin’s Creed games via each title’s main menu, told The Verge that the in-game issue was quickly resolved once it was brought to the company’s attention.

“We have been made aware that some players encountered pop-up ads while playing certain Assassin’s Creed titles yesterday,” they said. “This was the result of a technical error that we addressed as soon as we learned of the issue.”

Ubisoft recently said it was working on New Game Plus and permadeath modes for Assassin’s Creed Mirage, which will arrive as part of a free title update in December.

Assassin’s Creed Mirage was released on October 5 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC, and an iPhone 15 Pro version is set to follow in early 2024.

A week after its release, Ubisoft said the game was its biggest PS5 and Xbox Series X/S launch to date in terms of unit sales. </textarea>
