                <textarea id="text" readonly> Striking new research has revealed the 10 crucial lifestyle choices that lower your risk of cancer by 70 per cent.

Breastfeeding, avoiding certain supplements and eating no more than three portions of red meat per week are just three.

Also on the list (below) are getting two and a half hours of exercise per week, avoiding sugary drinks, keeping a healthy weight and limiting fast food.

Unfortunately for boozers, quitting alcohol completely is another anti-cancer step.

The research was conducted to analyze the validity of a previous set of 10 similar recommendations set by The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) and the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR).

During breastfeeding, periods are irregular - and this lowers the amount of the sex hormone estrogen that the body is exposed to over a lifetime. Excess estrogen has been linked to an increased cancer risk

Researchers from Newcastle University in the UK tested the guidance on people from Britain, using data from 94,778 adults with an average age of 56.

They used self-reported data on diet and exercise, as well as participants' body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference measurements.

Each participant was scored on their adherence to the recommendations out of seven.

They also used cancer registry data to track cancer diagnoses during the eight-year study period.

THE 10 CRUCIAL STEPS TO LOWERING YOUR RISK OF CANCER Staying at the lower end of the healthy BMI range: 18.5-24.9 Two and a half hours of exercise per week Eat a balanced diet - containing at least 30g of fiber a day and at least five portions of fruits and vegetables Limit fast food Eat no more than three portions of red meat a week Avoid drinks with added sugar No alcohol Stay away from supplements for cancer prevention Breastfeed if able to for six months Continue to follow doctor's advice after a cancer diagnosis Advertisement

They controlled for age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation, ethnicity, and smoking status in their analyses.

On average, participants scored 3.8 out of seven for adherence to the recommendations.

Some 7,296 participants (eight percent) developed cancer during the study.

The researchers found that greater adherence to the suggestions led to a lower cancer risk.

For every recommendation patients stuck to, they lowered their cancer risk by seven percent.

They also found that each one-point increase in adherence score was associated with a 10 percent lower risk of breast cancer, a 10 percent lower risk of colorectal cancer, an 18 percent lower risk of kidney cancer, a 16 percent lower risk of esophageal cancer, a 22 percent lower risk of liver cancer, a 24 percent lower risk of ovarian cancer, and a 30 percent lower risk of gallbladder cancer.

People with a score of 4.5 or more had a 16 percent lower risk of all cancers combined, compared to those with an adherence score of 3.5 points or less.

Perhaps one of the most surprising recommendations was breastfeeding.

Researchers suggest the protection may be due to hormonal changes that occur during lactation.

During breastfeeding, periods are irregular - and this lowers the amount of the sex hormone estrogen that the body is exposed to over a lifetime.

Excess estrogen has been linked to an increased cancer risk.

Meanwhile, fast food is associated with cancer because eating it in large amounts makes you more likely to overweight. Excess weight can trigger a host of hormonal changes that can cause tumors to grow.

Red and processed meat contains compounds such as heme and nitrates, which when broken down in the body, forms compounds that can damage the cells lining the bowel, increasing the likelihood of cancer developing.

The 10 recommendations for preventing cancer include avoiding red meat and alcohol, exercising for at least two hours per week, and breastfeeding if possible

As for alcohol: it breaks down into a chemical called acetaldehyde, which can spark DNA damage that is linked to a host of cancers.

There is also no evidence that taking supplements for cancer prevention has any benefit, and according to the WCRI, people should aim to get their nutrients from their food and drink alone.

Cancer dietician Nichole Andrews previously said: 'If you take over 200 percent daily value of a bunch of supplements that you do not need, these become free radicals and increase cancer risk.'

The researchers highlighted that because their study is observational, they do not know for certain that the lower cancer risk was caused by adherence to the 10 recommendations.

The findings were published in the journal BMC Medicine. </textarea>
