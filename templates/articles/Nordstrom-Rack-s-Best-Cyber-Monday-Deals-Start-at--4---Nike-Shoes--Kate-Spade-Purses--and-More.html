Best Nordstrom Rack Cyber Monday Deals

Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Stripe Throw Blanket, $45 (Save 68%)

Nordstrom Rack

It was hard to narrow down the best Nordstrom Rack Cyber Monday deals, but these are the ones that came out on top. This leather Kate Spade crossbody bag is a staggering 58 percent off and is available in seven colors, all of which are equally marked down. The black one is practically a dupe for Mindy Kaling’s crossbody, while the warm beige color is like Jennifer Aniston’s.

Save 65 percent on Sorel shoes (an Oprah-”favorite” brand), and for white elephant gift exchanges, get this Barefoot Dreams blanket or Clinique makeup set for under $50 and under $25, respectively. You can also charm your giftees with Nike sneakers, a new winter coat, or travel-friendly tote bag from the brand Kate Middleton has carried.

For the person who wants hair that’s straight out of a classic shampoo commercial, they might enjoy the Olaplex Hair Repair Treatment Set. It comes with four products that strengthen and repair hair bonds from the inside out, and it’s been praised by many customers: “My hair was like straw, [and] now it’s soft and shiny,” said one shopper. After shampooing and conditioning, they can then style with the Cortex Beauty 2-in-1 Revolving Hot Brush that’s been dropped from $250 to $52.

For the beauty gurus, this Too Faced Better Than Chocolate Eyeshadow Palette has 18 shades, including browns, pinks, and metallics that can also be used as bronzer, blush, and highlighter. Pair it with this nine-piece makeup brush kit, and you’ve struck glam gold.

Nordstrom Rack’s shoe section might as well be dedicated to celebrities: It has so many brands we’ve spotted on A-listers like Jennifer Garner and Blake Lively. For example, the color of these Hoka sneakers fall somewhere between Cameron Diaz’s and Harry Styles’ pairs, and these all-white sneakers are from Adidas, a brand Rihanna, Katie Holmes, and Jennifer Lawrence. As for Sorel boots, which are marked down to $110, we’ve spotted a similar style on Kate Middleton.
