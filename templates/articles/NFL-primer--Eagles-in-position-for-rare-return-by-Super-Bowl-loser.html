The plight of being the team that loses the Super Bowl can be difficult. The season was just as long and draining as it was for the Super Bowl winner, without the same reward. No place in history has been secured. Instead, there is a shortened offseason and a lengthy road ahead from training camp to the preseason to the regular season, merely to attempt to get right back to the same place and secure a better outcome.

Only eight NFL teams have gone back to the Super Bowl after losing the previous season. Only three of those losers have won in their returns.

The Philadelphia Eagles are making a strong bid to join that list.

They lost a highly competitive Super Bowl to the Kansas City Chiefs last February in Glendale, Ariz. Coach Nick Sirianni immediately lost both his coordinators to head coaching jobs, with offensive coordinator Shane Steichen hired by the Indianapolis Colts and defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon going to the Arizona Cardinals.

But as November draws to a close, the Eagles have a league-best record of 9-1. No other NFL team has fewer than three losses. The Eagles are 1½ games ahead of the San Francisco 49ers and the Detroit Lions in the race for NFC’s top playoff seed. They have beaten their leading challenger in the NFC East, the Dallas Cowboys. They’re coming off a triumph Monday night at Kansas City in the Super Bowl rematch. Quarterback Jalen Hurts is an MVP contender. The Eagles’ push-the-quarterback sneak with Hurts remains a virtually unstoppable play in short-yardage situations.

But the games that will define their season are still to come. The victory over the Cowboys on Nov. 5 in Philadelphia before the Eagles’ bye week and Monday’s win over the Chiefs began a rugged six-game stretch. The Eagles host the Buffalo Bills on Sunday at Lincoln Financial Field. Then comes a Dec. 3 clash with the 49ers in Philadelphia in a rematch of last season’s NFC championship game, followed by a game Dec. 10 against the Cowboys in Arlington, Tex. and another difficult road test in Seattle.

First, the Eagles must deal with quarterback Josh Allen and a 6-5 Bills team still trying to reassemble its season and fight for an AFC playoff spot.

“What’s done is done,” Hurts said during a midweek news conference. “I’ll just say that …. We’re about to play a really good team with really good players, a really good quarterback, a really good defense. They’re well coached. So that’s where our focus is and embracing that challenge ahead of us.”

The Eagles were fortunate to escape with Monday night’s 21-17 win after Chiefs wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling dropped what would have been a go-ahead touchdown pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes in the game’s final two minutes. Sirianni celebrated with Eagles fans at Arrowhead Stadium as he left the field following the game. He also drew some scrutiny for being shown on video gloating about the victory while addressing Chiefs fans loudly and profanely as he made his way toward the tunnel leading to the locker room.

“See ya!”

“I don’t hear fans all that often,” Sirianni said at a news conference. “I did in this game. I definitely heard them at halftime. And so I give them credit. They aren’t Philly fans. They aren’t as good as Philly fans. But I definitely heard a couple things they were saying in the game …. With everything that I am, I’m not going to hide who I am.”

Such intensity, if properly channeled, could aid the Eagles as they attempt to join the 1971 Cowboys, the ’72 Miami Dolphins and the 2018 New England Patriots in winning the Super Bowl after losing the previous one. The five other teams to return to the Super Bowl in the season after losing it are the 1974 Minnesota Vikings, the 1987 Denver Broncos and the 1991, ’92 and ’93 Bills.

Hurts said last week that, for now, the Eagles are concerned only about Sunday’s task at hand against the current edition of the Bills.

“It’s a huge challenge for us,” Hurts said. “I think the most important thing right now is just really keeping the main thing the main thing, taking it one day at a time, focusing on our preparation throughout this unique week.”

Phillips’s injury: Dolphins linebacker Jaelan Phillips suffered a torn Achilles’ tendon during Friday’s triumph over the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium and will miss the remainder of the season, Coach Mike McDaniel confirmed Saturday.

Phillips suffered the noncontact injury late in the 34-13 victory and was taken from the field on a cart.

He wrote later Friday on social media that he was “absolutely devastated” but vowed: “I’ll be back stronger than ever.”

Absolutely devastated, but I feel strength in knowing that this is all a part of God’s plan, and that I have an incredible team and support system around me. I’ll be back stronger than ever 💪🏽 Fins up 🐬🙏🏾 — Jaelan Phillips ;🕴🏾® (@JJPhillips15) November 25, 2023

Phillips finishes the season with 6.5 sacks. He has 22 sacks in his three NFL seasons, all with the Dolphins.

Several Dolphins players were critical after the game of the turf at MetLife Stadium, suggesting that it may have contributed to Phillips’s injury.

Pats QBs: The Patriots went through their post-bye week of practice without Coach Bill Belichick naming a starter at quarterback for Sunday’s game against the New York Giants in East Rutherford, N.J.

Belichick benched Mac Jones late in the Patriots’ loss to the Indianapolis Colts two weeks ago in Germany, their most recent game. Jones just had thrown an unsightly interception as the Patriots drove toward a possible go-ahead touchdown. Backup Bailey Zappe came on and threw an interception to seal the outcome on a play on which he faked a clock-stopping spike.

The defeat dropped the Patriots’ record to 2-8 amid questions about Belichick’s future with the franchise that he has coached to six Super Bowl victories. </textarea>
