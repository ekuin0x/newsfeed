                <textarea id="text" readonly> American model Gigi Hadid posted a photo on Instagram falsely portraying Palestinian terrorist Ahmed Manasra as a 'child prisoner of war,' to her nearly 80 million followers.

On the same day Hamas released 13 hostages, Hadid claimed that Ahmed was 'abducted' and bizarrely accused Israel of 'raping and murdering' innocent people.

In the since-removed post, Hadid shared a photo of Ahmed, who was imprisoned for going on a stabbing rampage in Jerusalem in 2015, where he proudly claimed, 'I came here with my cousin to stab Jews.'

Disturbing footage released by police at the time, shows the then-13-year-old knife-wielding Ahmed and his cousin, Hassan Manasra, 15, chasing after Israelis on the street as the innocent civilians run away.

They critically stabbed a 13-year-old boy on a bicycle, who was leaving a candy shop.

In the since-removed post, Hadid shared a photo of Ahmed, who was imprisoned for going on a stabbing rampage in Jerusalem back in 2015, where he proudly claimed, 'I came here with my cousin to stab Jews'

Hadid, known for her controversial anti-Israel activism, also falsely claimed that Israel is the only country keeping children as prisoners of war.

She captioned the photo with 'Israel is the only country in the world that keeps CHILDREN AS PRISONERS OF WAR.' She goes on to bizarrely write the words, 'ABDCUTION, RAPE, HUMILIATION, TORTURE, MURDER, OF PALESTINIANS YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE Oct 7 2023.'

Security prisoners in Israel have many rights, including family visits, Red Cross visits, access to books and letters. They also have TV, classes and a canteen to buy products, according to the Israeli Knesset Research and Information Center.

Hadid claimed the Ahmed was 'abducted' by the 'Israeli occupation' at 12. Ahmed was 13 at the time, and was not abducted but prosecuted for his crimes of attempted murder.

Ahmad was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to nine and a half years in prison. While in prison, he attempted to harm himself and others multiple times.

Hadid's post received immediate backlash and has since been taken down.

The post received criticism for spreading false information and increasing antisemitism. Users condemned her, with one calling her a 'social media terrorist' and another suggesting that the Hadid family move to Gaza.

One wrote: 'She's a social media terrorist and should be punished for spreading false information that increases antisemitism.'

Another commented, 'The entire Hadid family have blood on their hands.'

'Why doesn't the Hadid family move to Gaza? Yalla,' a third user wrote.

Hadid's post comes as the first group of hostages were released from Gaza after 48 days of captivity as part of a truce deal between Israel and Hamas that went into effect this morning - with children and a grandmother thought to have died in captivity among them.

Thirteen Israeli women and children and 11 Thai and Filipino hostages, who were kidnapped and taken into the territory by the terror group in its October 7 attack on Israel, were finally freed today after an agonizing wait.

Israel — wrenched by the abduction of nearly 240 people in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war — cheered as 13 Israeli women and children emerged free from Gaza.

Most were in their 70s or 80s, and the youngest was a 2-year-old. Also released were 10 people from Thailand and one from the Philippines.

In return, Israel released 39 Palestinian prisoners - 24 women and 15 teenagers - who have were in prison for various violent crimes.

They have been released by Israel as part of the deal that paused the fighting in the Gaza Strip for the first time in seven weeks which was sparked by Hamas's attack, Qatar's foreign ministry confirmed.

Israeli media reported the hostages had been transferred by Hamas to the Red Cross, then on to the Egyptians, before crossing into Egypt. Live footage showed the hostages leaving Red Cross vans and entering a trauma center at the Rafah Crossing to undergo medical examinations.

Qatar's foreign ministry said tonight that ten Thai prisoners, and one Filipino citizen have been released, alongside the 13 Israeli prisoners, who are now back in Israel and will soon be reunited with their families, the IDF confirmed.

Going the other way were 39 Palestinian prisoners - 24 women and 15 teenagers - who have been released by Israel as part of the deal that paused the fighting in the Gaza Strip for the first time in seven weeks which was sparked by Hamas's attack, Qatar's foreign ministry confirmed.

Israeli prison transport vans have been seen leaving the Ofer military prison near Jerusalem, with Palestinian prisoners believed to be onboard.

The lists of all civilians that would be released from Gaza has been agreed, but was not released publicly ahead of time. Some 30 children are currently believed to be among the 240 captives who were taken into Gaza by Hamas.

The full list was later revealed as Margalit Moses (72), Adina Moshe (72), Danielle Aloni (45) and her daughter Emilia (six), Doron Asher (34) and her daughters Raz (four) and Aviv (two), Hanna Katzir (77), Keren Munder (54) and her son Ohad Munder-Zichri (nine), Ruti/Ruthi Munder (78), Yafa/Yaffa Adar (85), and Hannah Perry/Chana Peri (79).

This is not the first time Hadid was blasted for her anti-Israel posts.

The post on Hadid's Instagram that caught the attention of the Israeli government. It comes after a week of Hadid sharing pro-Palestinian statements that blur the lines of where blame for the Hamas terror attack should be placed

The official State of Israel Instagram page flamed the model for her lukewarm statement about extremist Palestinian terrorism and implied blame being placed on Israel for the attack

Hadid was slammed by the Israeli government after she posted in support of the Palestinian people on her Instagram story in October, only weeks after the October 7 slaughtering.

Hadid, whose famous real-estate developer father Mohamed Hadid, is Palestinian, posted a graphic about the war that read: 'There is nothing Jewish about the Israeli government's treatment of Palestinians.'

'Condemning the Israeli government is not anti-Semitic and supporting Palestinians is not supporting Hamas.'

Israel's government quickly skewered Hadid's position, posting on their Instagram story a response that read: 'There is nothing valiant about Hamas' massacre of Israelis. Condemning Hamas for what it is (ISIS) is not anti-Palestine and supporting Israelis in their fight against barbaric terrorists is the right thing to do.'

The account of the State of Israel then directed comments at Hadid specifically, tagging her account and writing: 'Have you been sleeping the past week?'

'Or you just fine turning a blind eye to Jewish babies being butchered in their homes? Your silence has been very clear about where you stand. We see you.' </textarea>
