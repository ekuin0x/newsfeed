                <textarea id="text" readonly> Cyber Monday has arrived, and that means one thing, more deals. Well, it actually means two things, the deals are also coming to a close. November 27 is the cut-off date for most retailers and brands when it comes to Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals this year, so this is your last chance to save.

Even before today, some deals have already started to sell out due to popularity -- so it's officially time to make those purchases ASAP to ensure you're not disappointed at the end of today. Hot tips on what's popular and a good deal: The Spider-Man 2 PS5 slim bundles are by far the most popular Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals in gaming offer so far this shopping season.

We've also been blessed with Final Fantasy 16 for $35, 30% off PS Plus, DualSense Controllers for $49, and a whole slew of other PS5 games on sale. Check out everything just below or follow @IGNDeals for even more updates on the best deals today.

Save 10% Off PlayStation Wallet Funds for Cyber Monday

Wait! Before you purchase anything on the digital PlayStation Store or buy/upgrade your PS Plus membership, consider these PlayStation Gift Cards which are currently 10% off. Now while these 'gift cards' do make wonderful gifts for the PlayStation fan in your life, there's nothing stopping you from just applying the code provided to your account. Buy as many of these as you like, and apply as many codes as you see fit in order to make the most savings (including on PS Plus), but this is also your last chance to do so. The $110 gift card deal has expired, but the $70, $55, and $40 cards are still 10% off at the time of writing.

PS5 Controller Cyber Monday Deals: DualSense for $49

One of the more standout deals for the Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend is Sony's DualSense Black Friday deal. Opting for controllers like the Volcanic Red, Cobalt Blue, Galactic Purple or Gray Camo is your best bet as these are some of the most popular, tend to sell out during sale events, and cost the most at $74.99 MSRP -- so buying at the $49 Black Friday offer will maximize your savings. Many of these even sold out over the weekend, but are now back for Cyber Monday! You should probably consider making your purchase soon to avoid disappointment, as the CYber Monday sales do indicate the end of this deal.

PS5 Cyber Monday Game Deals

One of the very best things about Cyber Monday is all the amazing savings on video games. This includes discounts on Hogwarts Legacy, Final Fantasy 16, Star Wars Jedi Survivor, and loads more as well. Many PS5 game deals have already started to sell out or expire, so don't hang around and bag the deals you need ASAP - especially as this is your last chance to do so.

Cyber Monday PS Plus Deals: Last Chance for 30% Off

PSA: If you're buying anything digitally on PS5 (including PS Plus), ensure you're purchasing at least one of the PS Wallet Top Up cards that we mentioned above -- this will maximise your potential savings for Cyber Monday.

PlayStation Plus has received its Black Friday and Cyber Monday discount (see here) -- up to 30% off for new subscribers, while those on Essential or Extra tier can get money off upgrading their membership. However, this potentially could be seen as a temporary reversal of the recent 30% price hike that Sony inplemented in September. If the previous price increase deterred you, the return to the previous pricing still might catch the attention of new PS5 owners who purchased a console.

For existing subscribers, you can disregard the information below and directly log into your account to discover the specific discount Sony is providing for an upgrade to PS Plus Extra or Premium. The offered discount may vary based on the remaining time of your individual PS Plus subscription.

PlayStation Plus Essential 12-Month Subscription: $59.99 (was $79.99)

PlayStation Plus Extra 12-Month Subscription: $99.99 (was $134.99)

PlayStation Plus Premium 12-Month Subscription: $119.99 (was $159.99)

PS5 Black Friday Shopping Tips

Many of these tips are applicable no matter what youâ€™re shopping for on Black Friday.

Plan Your Spending - It's important to acknowledge that many of us have substantial video game backlogs. Just because you spot a game you desire on sale, doesn't mean you should rush to buy it. Set a budget and stick to it. Only invest in games you genuinely intend to play in the near future.

Create a Wishlist - A practical approach to keep your Black Friday spending in check is by crafting a wishlist of games or items you're interested in purchasing, and then adhere to it. Resist the temptation of deals that don't align with the items you would have bought otherwise.

Compare Prices - It's not uncommon to be enticed by what seems like an excellent Black Friday deal (for instance, The Last of Us Part 1 for $39.99). However, it's wise to double-check by looking at other popular retailers to see if they offer a matching or even better sale price before hitting the buy button.

Act Swiftly on Exceptional Deals - When you stumble upon a truly remarkable deal on a PlayStation game or accessory, don't hesitate. Retailers have limited stock, and the best deals are likely to sell out before Black Friday concludes. Seize the fantastic deals promptly.

But, Don't Worry if You Miss Out - If you attempt to purchase an outstanding deal and discover that it's sold out, don't be disheartened. Often, the very same Black Friday deal may resurface on Cyber Monday. And even if it doesn't, the next Prime Day will arrive sooner than you think.
