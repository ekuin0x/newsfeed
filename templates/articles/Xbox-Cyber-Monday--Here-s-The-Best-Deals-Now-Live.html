                <textarea id="text" readonly> Xbox Cyber Monday deals are still in full swing - but time and some of the best deals are running out. Cyber Monday also signals the last chance you can bag any of these deals. Many of them are even starting to expire or sell out as we get into the final hours of the sales event.

Our favorites at the moment include the Xbox Series S - Starter Bundle (including three months of Xbox Game Pass) for just $249 at Walmart. There's also up to $30 off Xbox Controllers, including deals on all color variations possible. But, that's not all, so make sure you take some time to dig into the rest of the deals we've found for you just below. Rival console PlayStation's Cyber Monday deals are pretty fantastic as well, so there's never been a better time to be a gamer looking for a deal.

One of the very top offers is the Xbox Series S Black Friday deal -- as this bundle is now only $234.99 at Dell. This is a 22% discount from the standard price, and even packs in three months of Game Pass Ultimate at no extra cost -- which is an additional $50 in savings as well. This is our favorite deal in the sale for Xbox.

For those after an Xbox Series X Black Friday deal, you also won't be disapointed. Walmart is coming up with the goods and has the Xbox Series X Diablo 4 bundle for just $439 right now. There's also the Diablo 4 + Modern Warfare 3 bundle for $489 -- another example of some serious savings to be had this Black Friday. Finally, if you're a Best Buy Plus/ Total member you can currently also get a Series X for $399.99 + a Best Buy $50 Gift Card.

Cyber Monday: Xbox Controller Deals

Xbox Controllers have managed to score a huge discount for Black Friday, with up to $30 off the colorful gamepads over the next week or so. While the initial discount was seemingly looking disapointing ($10 off), online retailers have come through and put out some especially top deals for the Xbox controllers.

The cheapest controller you can get right now is for $39.99 at Best Buy (see here), and its the Stellar Shift Special Edition with an MSRP of $69.99. This was such a good deal, it's actually now sold out. But have no fear, as all other controllers have dropped to somewhere between $40-45 at most retailers, which is a decent $20-$30 off the standard Xbox controller and a reasonable deal for Cyber Monday. Plus, this includes some of the newer color variations as well like the Astral Purple design.

Best Xbox Game Pass Deals for Cyber Monday

Xbox Game Pass Ultimate: 3 Month Membership 16 $44.99 See on Amazon

We all heard about the Xbox Game Pass price hike that Microsoft implemented recently. A month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate now costs $16.99, a hefty fee. But, if you weren't aware, you can actually still circumvent this change by buying Game Pass codes from retailers like Amazon who haven't yet increased their prices to reflect the change. Paying $44.99 isn't a huge discount versus the $50.97 Microsoft charges, but it's not nothing. Also, it's very possible the price drops lower at some point during Black Friday.

Cyber Monday: Xbox Accessory Deals

Black Friday Deal WD_BLACK C50 1TB Expansion Card SSD for Xbox Series X|S 17% off $149.99 2 $124.99 See on Amazon

Games are huge these days, so if you're running low on storage on your Xbox Series X or S, you're far from alone. Xbox expansion cards are essentially NVME SSDs encased in a specialized Xbox-compatible shell. Unlike the more complex PS5 SSD installation process, which involves opening up the PS5 to access the SSD slot, the Seagate expansion card simply plugs into its dedicated port on the back of the Xbox. With this deal, you can add 1TB of storage that acts just like regular internal storage, for cheaper than normal.
