                <textarea id="text" readonly> Relax. You can un-clench your wallet now. You've moseyed into a budget-friendly Cyber Monday post. Yes, there's such a thing. Even in this wallet-sucking, double sales week, there are plenty of Cyber Monday deals for under $50 on reviewer-approved gadgets. No random third-party sellers or too-good-to-be-true gear—just the stuff we actually like that's actually affordable. We updated this post on November 27 at 1 am.

We test products year-round and handpicked these deals. The discounts we show are based on actual street prices at retailers in the past few months. Products that are sold out or no longer discounted as of publishing will be crossed out. We'll update this guide periodically.

If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.

Cyber Monday Tech Deals

Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max Photograph: Best Buy

If you watch mainly Amazon Prime content, the Fire TV Stick is the streaming device you need, and this one was just released at the end of September. You can stream from any service, of course, but it's heavily geared toward the company's own content. This 4K Max is faster, with 16 gigabytes of storage versus 8, but if you want to spend less and still stay in the Amazon ecosystem, the also-new 4K Stick is on sale for $25 ($25 off).

The Echo Show 5 is typically overpriced at $90, but the deal price of $40 matches the best we have tracked. Just keep in mind that it goes on sale quite frequently. We prefer the Echo Show 10 for its larger size, but the smaller footprint of the Echo Show 5 is good for a nightstand or tiny kitchen.

This owl- or dragon-patterned, Alexa-powered smart speaker is our favorite speaker for kids, and it opens up a world of music, audiobooks, and kid-friendly content. You get a year of Amazon Kids+ (usually $3 per month), it's easy to configure via the parent dashboard, and it can serve as a regular Bluetooth speaker. Just bear in mind that it is internet-connected and has a microphone. Older kids will likely prefer the Amazon Echo (8/10, WIRED recommends), also on sale for $55 ($45 off). They have been this low before.

We're not sure if smart displays will be around forever, but if you want one, Google makes some of the best. This 2nd-gen Nest Hub (7/10, WIRED Recommends) doesn't have a camera (unlike the Nest Hub Max), so you have some privacy peace of mind. It's compact with a 7-inch screen, which makes it ideal for your bedside table, and it has sleep-sensing tech to track your sleep quality.

Photograph: Amazon

Even with the subscription ($3/month or $30/year), this video doorbell is one of the cheapest options around, and it made the honorable mentions section in our Best Video Doorbells guide. Video quality is 1080p with a limited field of view, and notifications aren't the fastest, but it performs reliably. If you don't want a subscription, consider buying it bundled with the Sync Module 2 ($47), which is also half-price right now.

If you just need a cheap way to monitor an entrance area, this wired security camera can stream and record at up to 2K and reliably detects motion. The frame rate is low, and there's lag on the two-way audio. You also need to insert a microSD card to record locally or pony up for a subscription (from $3.50 a month). As the budget pick in our Best Indoor Security Cameras guide, the Tapo C110 is frequently discounted, but we have never seen it this low.

We called the Blink Mini cheap, compact, and versatile, with good video quality, in our Best Indoor Security Cams guide. It has two-way audio, accurate motion detection, and integration with Alexa. Like other Blink products, the best features are locked behind a premium subscription that starts at $3 a month. But that's still pretty cheap compared to other security camera systems.

Lume's mobile tripod is very stable, but the best part is that the ends of the clamp double as cold shoe mounts, so you can hook up a microphone and a compact video light for a full on-the-go studio. It's fairly comfortable to grip and carry if you are moving around as you film. Our only gripe is that you can't adjust the height.

Photograph: Google

This is the lowest price we've tracked for the Google Chromecast 4K (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Just plug the HDMI dongle into your TV and you'll get a snazzy and easy-to-use interface that you can control with the color-matched remote. There's even built-in Google Assistant. Just keep in mind that you may have to manually clear the cache frequently, since there's not a lot of onboard storage. The HD version of the Chromecast is also on sale for $20, and it's ideal for anyone with a 1080p TV.

For non-4K TVs, it doesn't pay to spring for an expensive, 4K-capable streaming device. Save some coin and buy this 1080p-capable streaming system to gain access to Amazon Fire TV. It doesn't support Dolby Atmos sound, but if your TV isn't 4K then it's likely to not support Dolby Atmos, anyway. Read our Best Streaming Devices guide for other options.

Smart bulbs are best when you can fill the entire room (or a couple rooms!) with them. This four-pack of our favorite smart bulbs is a winner. It's at a price we do see from time to time for this bundle, but it's a good deal.

Photograph: Govee

Govee makes some of our favorite smart lighting, and this diffused light strip can be installed on the wall, stairs, or anywhere else in plain view. It comes with adhesive brackets, so you can make curved shapes like clouds. It supports countless effects in the Govee app, and works with voice commands from Google Assistant or Alexa. It has been discounted before, but we've never seen it this low.

Wonderfully colorful, bright, diffused light streams from these modular bars, and they are easy to fit. This kit includes six bars and a corner piece. The Govee app offers some great animated scenes, and you can even create your own. Sadly, they lack physical controls, and you need a bunch of them to create an interesting pattern. They appear in our Best Smart Lighting guide.

You can get Hulu for $1 per month for a full year with this Cyber Monday offer. It is one of the Best Streaming Services with an enormous choice of new and classic TV shows, movies, and live TV. You can also bundle it with Disney+ for $3 per month for a year ($10 off). The offer is open to new and eligible returning customers who haven't been subscribers in the past month. At the end of the year prices revert to $8/month and $13/month, respectively.

Amazon's cute Echo Pop (7/10, WIRED Review) is affordable, comes in fun colors, and it's tiny compared to the fully round speakers Amazon usually produces. It sounds good too, but not as good as some of the other Echos.

Superstars is very much a classic Sonic sidescroller, brought to a modern console with slicker graphics. It looks great on the OLED Switch's screen. It's normally sold for its list price of $60 and can be had for barely more than half that right now.

If you're primarily shooting still images on a mirrorless camera this card is plenty fast enough for most people and saves you considerable money over the faster version above. This one is also never full price, but again this is the lowest price we've seen this year.

Amazon has a ton of gift cards that come with free credits right now. Each one has a unique corresponding coupon code that you can see on this page. For example, you can get a $100 Apple Gift Card and a free $15 Amazon credit with code APPLET5USA. There are tons of cards to choose from. You can browse them all here.

Accessory Deals

Photograph: Anker

This compact power bank slides into the USB-C port of your phone to top up the battery. In fact, it's our top pick for phones in our Best Portable Chargers guide. Only the shell-white color is on sale, but it's a nifty way to add 5,000 mAh of capacity. However, it might not be a good pick if you have a thick case. The pink Lightning port version is also discounted to $20 right now.

This solid option from Anker made the honorable mentions in our Best Portable Chargers guide. It has a 10,000-mAh capacity, good for just shy of two full charges for most phones, a built-in USB-C cable that doubles as a loop for easy carrying, and an additional USB-C and USB-A port. It maxes out at 30 watts each way and can be fully charged in around two hours.

We like Anker's chargers, and its Prime range employs GaN technology to shrink the size down. This 67-watt charger has fold-out prongs and offers two USB-C ports and one USB-A. It can charge a MacBook, and it supports fast charging for iPhones, Samsung Galaxy S phones, and Pixel phones.

Put this little USB-C to USB-C accessory on your keychain—now you practically always have a cable on you to charge a device, provided you can find a USB-C power adapter. You can always connect your device to another USB-C device in a pinch too, like a friend's phone. There's a USB-C to Lightning version also on sale.

This charger packs two USB-C ports, one of which can output 65 watts when used alone. If you plug two devices in, the top will deliver 45 watts and the bottom can do 20 watts. It also folds up and looks super sleek.

Photograph: iOttie

What we like best about this phone mount is that you can use it one-handed. The arms automatically close around the phone when you place it against the trigger button. To remove it, press the release bars. There's also a telescopic arm and ball joint that allows you to tweak the placement and set an ideal angle. We also love the clever magnetic tab that attaches the charging cable to the back of the mount, to keep from having to fish around for it. Plus, it's super sturdy, even on bumpy roads.

This is our favorite way to mount an iPhone or Android phone to a bike or scooter. Or pretty much anything that's a rod. It sits secure, and you have to pair it with a Peak Design SlimLink case for added security—your MagSafe iPhone won't fly off even if you go over a deep pothole. Other MagSafe accessories from the company are also on sale, like the Car Vent Mount, which we also really like.

Apple's dual USB-C port power adapter is an essential accessory if you have a tendency to forget to pack chargers for your devices on the go. With two USB-C ports, you can use it to recharge both your iPhone and MacBook simultaneously. Rated at 35 watts, it's also powerful enough to recharge an iPad Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max.

This is a price match of the discounts we've seen on other shopping holidays. It's still a good deal on an excellent controller, and the price extends to several different color options. Our favorite part about the DualSense controller is the way the haptic feedback works. Rather than random rumbles, you'll feel directional and immersive feedback—almost like surround sound, but in a controller. Read more about it in our Best PlayStation 5 Accessories guide.

Photograph: Baggu

The 16-inch version Baggu Laptop Sleeve in Sherbert Cherry looks just as cute in person as it does online. The puffiness provides plenty of protection, and the velcro closure is strong enough you don’t have to worry the laptop will slide out. We tested it with the 15-inch MacBook Air, which left space to squeeze a keyboard and mouse into the sleeve as well. There's also a 13/14-inch version for those who have smaller MacBooks or want a sleeve for their iPads.

You get a good balance of speed and reliability with this USB 3.2 flash drive from SanDisk, and we have never seen it lower. As the top pick in our Best USB Flash Drives guide, we like the sleek and durable aluminum case, handy loop for attaching it to a key ring, and the fact it delivers the advertised speeds (420 megabytes per second read, 380 MB/s write). This has been performing well for us for a couple of years now and comes with a lifetime warranty.

The PNY Pro Elite V2 sports a compact design and zippy performance (read speeds up to 600 MB/s and write speeds up to 250 MB/s). The plastic cover slides to protect the USB-A plug and there's a handy opening for a lanyard of keyring. This is the compact pick in our Best USB Flash Drives guide. It only comes with a one-year limited warranty, but this is as low as we've seen it.

If you're looking for storage that can survive the elements and come through tumbles or bumps unscathed, the Corsair Flash Survivor Stealth is the most durable pick in our Best USB Flash Drives guide. It's not that fast (85 MB/s read, 70 MB/s write), but it is tough. You can also get the 128 GB model for $30 ($16 off) or the 256 GB model for $55 ($29 off). Discounts on these are common, but this as low as we've seen them go.

Photograph: Cable Matters

This cable can do it all, which is why it's currently sitting at the top of our Best USB-C Cables guide. It can deliver 100 watts, transfer data at up to 40 Gbps, and serve an 8K display (or two 4K displays). It supports DisplayPort Alt Mode (DP Alt Mode), USB Power Delivery (USB-PD), and PPS, and it is backward-compatible with all earlier standards. That said, it's pricey, even with the discount. The shorter cable is also on sale for even less.

This is a handy wee adapter if you want to plug your USB-C device into a monitor or TV that only accepts HDMI inputs. Provided your phone (or other USB-C gadget) supports DP (DisplayPort) Alt Mode, you can use this adapter to switch to HDMI 2.1, though you will still need an HDMI cable. It supports 8K at 30 Hz or 4K at up to 144 Hz. Just make sure you check compatibility before you buy. It appears in our Best USB-C Cables guide and we've never seen it discounted before.

If you're curious about the rate your gadgets are charging, this USB-C to USB-C cable from Baseus can tell you. There's an LED display on one of the ends that displays the charging rate in watts. It can deliver up to 100 watts, supports most fast charging protocols, and is braided for durability, but data transfer rates are capped at a measly 480 Mbps.

Photograph: Baseus

As the high-capacity pick in our Best MagSafe Power Banks guide, this Baseus charger has an ample 10,000-mAh capacity, an inoffensive design, and is soft to the touch. It fully charged my iPhone 14 Pro once, then delivered an additional 64 percent the second time before tapping out. It comes with a USB-C cable. The 6,000 mAh version is also on sale for $30 ($20 off). These deals are only for Prime members.

This stand goes on sale often during the holidays. It's still a good one. This tablet stand is included in several WIRED guides, including the Best iPad Accessories and the Best Work-from-Home Gear. The stand is lightweight, portable, and easy to use.

Apple's official MagSafe case has accurate cutouts for ports, clicky buttons, and it protects the entire bottom edge of the phone. It comes in a variety of colors too. Select colors are also on sale for the iPhone 15 Pro Max for the same price.

Photograph: Cync

The Cync Indoor Camera (9/10, WIRED Recommends) was one of the first to offer a privacy shutter that covers the lens when you're home or don't want to record. It also captures 1080p video at 25 frames-per-second, offers two-way audio, and accepts a microSD card (sold separately) for local storage (you can also subscribe for cloud storage from $3 per month). It is top of our Best Indoor Security Cameras guide, and this is as low as we've seen it go.

With an ultralight design that features a semitransparent lighting scheme, this mouse is gorgeous, and its buttons are unbelievably snappy. They offer sharp, rich clicks for your gaming sessions. It has a place in our Best Gaming Mouse guide, and we have never seen it with such a deep discount before.

You can slide on plug attachments to support outlets across the world with this adapter. It turns a single outlet into two grounded US AC outlets and also has two USB-A ports, two USB-C ports, and a built-in USB-C cable to charge up all your small gadgets. It appears in our Best Travel Adapters guide, and we have seen it at this price before but never lower.

We haven't written about it since 2019, but Twelve South's Bluetooth accessory is indispensable for anyone who wants to enjoy in-flight entertainment without using wired headphones. It also works with hotel treadmills and game consoles, like the Nintendo Switch.

Photograph: Totallee

These iPhone cases from Totallee don't offer the most protection, but they're some of the thinnest out there. So, while it won't protect your phone from damage if you drop it, it'll at least keep your phone safe from everyday scuffs without adding much bulk. It's available for a variety of iPhone models.

This collab between the two brands brings the rugged design from Nomad's cases and the SlimLink MagSafe mount system from Peak Design. It's a great combo that gives you more security when mounting your iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro Max.

You will find Incipio cases in a few of our guides, such as the Best Samsung Galaxy S23 Cases and in the honorable mentions for the Best iPhones 15 Cases. For Cyber Monday, the case and accessory manufacturer is offering up to 50 percent off a wide selection of Incipio cases and Griffin accessories.

Photograph: Speck

Speck’s Smartshell case has the proper cutouts for ports, rubberized feet to keep your machine in place, and both pieces lip in securely. You can throw it in your backpack, tote, or duffle bag without worrying about damaging the machine. We tested it with the 14-inch MacBook Pro but it’s available for a wide range of MacBook models, too. It’s worth noting, however, that the hardshell isn’t scratch-resistant (despite Speck’s claims)—we’ve noticed a few scrapes on ours here and there, but it’s not too noticeable.

This is currently our favorite MacBook case. We tested it with the 16-inch MacBook Pro (2021), but it’s available for a few MacBook models. It has rubberized feet that prevent it from sliding, precise cutouts for all ports, and ventilation to keep the MacBook from overheating.

This microfiber mat will keep your desk looking nice and clean. It also doubles as a giant mousepad. It only comes in black, but it's a great option if you're looking for a desk mat that's minimalist and affordable.

This is one of our favorite MagSafe phone grips. It magnetically sticks to the back of your iPhone and you can pop out the grip for extra stability. You can just take it off to wirelessly charge your device.

Home, Health, and Kitchen Deals

Aeropress Photograph: Aeropress

The justly popular Aeropress' genius isn't so much that makes great coffee (it does), but that it makes it really difficult to make bad coffee. We've yet to have bad coffee from an Aeropress, which is something we can't really say for any other coffee brewer. If you're looking for a simple, fool-proof way to make a cup, this is the tool you need. We have seen the price get a little lower, but this is the lowest we've seen in six months.

Low on caffeine—and counter space? The K-Express is a mere 6.5 inches wide and 12 inches deep, yet its removable reservoir holds 36 fluid ounces of water, enough to make a round of coffee for you and your friends without having to constantly refill it. Just do the planet a solid and make sure to use Keurig Reusable Pods, to cut down on single-use plastic waste.

Just hang it and plug it in. This artificial Christmas wreath comes pre-lit with 50 multicolor LED lights. There are artificial berries and pine cones to liven up the display, too.

Don't forget the garland. Wreaths are ideal for doors and windows, and the tree is the centerpiece, but garland hung from banisters and fireplace mantles fills out the rest of the rooms. This 6-foot garland comes pre-lit with 50 multicolor LED lights, and like the Nearly Natural wreath it comes with artificial berries interspersed among the pine sprigs, but no pine cones.

Are you a star or an angel family? If you lean toward the five-pointed star, this battery-operated Christmas tree topper will free up precious electrical outlet space, which is always at a premium with all the strands of lights demanding plug real estate. Reviews say this topper runs through the trhee AA batteries quickly, so consider picking up a set of Panasonic Eneloop Rechargeable AAs for $28.

Photograph: Trade Coffee

Trade makes our favorite coffee subscription. Right now gift subscriptions and gift boxes are on sale at up to 30 percent off. Prices start at $21.

In our guide to the Best Coffee Subscriptions, we say Blue Bottle is the best pick for the fastest and freshest delivery. The Cyber Monday sale is vast, covering all sorts of blends and bundles. The discount will show up in your shopping cart.

This viral mug was featured in our gift guides for coffee lovers and moms—so if your momma loves coffee, it's a doubly great gift. It's usually pretty affordable, but this small Cyber Monday discount is still nice, especially if you opt to get a 4-pack and save over $30.

Photograph: Lodge

The enameled Dutch oven does away with bare cast iron's needy tendencies. You can scrub away at the interior and exterior of this Lodge with all the dish soap you like and never have to wipe it down with vegetable oil to keep it from rusting overnight. The nonstick, nonreactive surface is perfect for slow-cooking stews, oysters, and practically anything else on the stovetop for long periods.

Let's be real. This is a five-piece set. Nobody counts the lids as their own pieces. Still, this is a good deal for Pyrex, a (mostly) drop-proof tempered glass storage set that product reviewer Matt Jancer has been using this year for leftovers. Each piece is thick and burly, cuts out single-use plastics for storing leftovers, and washes up easily in the dishwasher.

Moft stands are configurable, and this one angles your laptop from 25 to 60 degrees. You probably don't want to stand all day at its highest, but for a little change up after lunch, it's nice. It collapses flat too, so you can pack it in a bag. The brand's Smart Desk Mat is discounted to $121 ($37 off) with code BF37. That one balances your laptop, phone, and wireless charging earbuds. It's not as easy to tote around given its size, but it's a great desk companion.

Photograph: Godiva

Imagine if those chocolate-based Advent calendars from your childhood didn't suck. This Godiva calendar has 25 pieces of decadent chocolate nestled behind its cardboard doors. It made our list of the Best Advent Calendars. If you choose to shop at Macy's you may be able to opt for free in-store pickup.

Target makes some of reviewer Nena Farrell's favorite Christmas decor, and it being on sale before the holiday instead of immediately after is a nice way to add a few things to your rotation this year. From string lights to miniature ceramic figurines, this is an easy way to save on decking the halls.

Like the decor, Target also makes great ornaments from pretty, to silly, to just plain cute. This deal includes single ornaments as well as multi-packs.

Photograph: Owala

Reviewer Medea Giordano called this her "emotional support water bottle." The Owala Freesip (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is colorful and durable, and the leakproof lid has a straw option as well as a sip option. Sip or slurp! The choice is yours. If you're shopping at Owala, the discount will reflect in your cart. Every capacity is on sale, but prices vary by retailer and color, so double-check and compare before you purchase. The deals generally match the lowest prices we've seen.

Reviewer Matt Jancer wouldn't go so far as to say that Werner is the only brand that makes a solid ladder, but from painting walls to putting up insulation, he's never had a Werner ladder fail on him. That level of trust is worth gold when you're talking about ladders. This 4-foot step ladder is a little guy, perfect for keeping in the home for jobs that require you to reach the ceiling. It holds up to 250 pounds, and remember to never stand on the top “step.”

The Hydro Jug Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a truly gargantuan water bottle. It may not be everyone's cup of tea—er, water—but if you struggle with staying hydrated or keeping your water bottle full, this absolute unit may be of some assistance. We've not seen the bottle sell for less.

JCPenney Wrinkle Guard Sateen Sheet Set Photograph: JCPenney

Sateen is another type of cotton weave, like percale, but uses extra threads to make it feel silkier. It's also a little heavier. JCPenney's sateen sheets are our favorite ones. We typically see them for $90, rather than the $140 list price, but this is still one of the cheapest prices we've tracked. All the sizes are $50 too, which is nice if you have a larger bed. They’re soft and cool, with the silky finish sateen is known for without being slippery. We can barely tell the difference between these ones and the sateen sheets that cost double the price.

This discount should be automatically applied in your cart. The Litter Genie is an amazing accessory if you don't want to be running garbage to the bins every day. Like a Diaper Genie, you scoop clumps into the top and pull the lever which drops the clumps into the bottom where it stays odor-free until it's time to empty it. There are smaller and cheaper ones, but this is a good size if you have multiple cats. It's compatible with the standard and jumbo size refills, but the latter lasts around fourish months depending on how much waste is going in there. They're also discounted to $8 ($12 off) with code PET50 at Chewy.

Photograph: Hatley

This is our top umbrella choice for kids, and it's a no-brainer at this price. WIRED editor Adrienne So's kids loved using it and appreciated the wooden handle. There are different prints you can choose from—this one has a canopy that changes colors.

Clear umbrellas mean your vision isn't blocked when you're walking in the rain, and you also look super chic. We like this one from Shedrain—it has eight fiberglass ribs and a steel shaft. The canopy is a bit wrinkly but it holds up well against strong winds.

We love pretty much everything Peak Design makes, which is amazing because almost everything is currently 10 to 15 percent off. Senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So particularly likes the Bike Mount, which locks your phone in place with the Everyday Case, which is also on sale, unless you want the iPhone 15 or Pixel 8 versions. The bags are on sale today.

Bessey makes product reviewer Matt Jancer’s favorite clamps. Although he typically reaches for a light-duty set of plastic bar clamps for the easiest jobs, he breaks out the Bessey clamps for more serious jobs, whether it’s indoors, outdoors, or in the garage. The combo kit includes a pair of 6-inch clamps and a pair of 12-inch clamps. In his experience using a pair of larger Bessey clutch clamps to fix a wooden table, he had no issues at all with slippage. The wooden handles seemed solid, and the quality of the clamps themselves made a strong impression on him.

Photograph: Hey Dewy

Enter code CM40 at checkout to get 40 percent off your order. We tried a slightly different version of this mini humidifier, but it worked well, keeping our dry skin at bay when placed on a nightstand. We're also currently testing the new, larger Wellness Humidifier which is discounted to $60 ($40 off). It's still compact enough to fit in a bedroom, but has a 1.5-liter capacity versus the mini's 11.3 ounces.

If you prefer to hand-grind your coffee like WIRED senior reviewer Scott Gilbertson, then Hario's Skerton Pro is the one to get. He says it's fast and produces a consistent, fine grind (so not a great choice for French press users). There's also a travel version that's on sale for a couple bucks off.

WIRED reviewer Brenda Stolyar never made waffles from scratch until she used the Dash Mini Waffle Maker. This mini (and cheap!) contraption opened her eyes to a world of delicious homemade recipes. We recommend this product in our guide to the Best Viral TikTok Gifts. It's usually pretty affordable, but for $13 it's a real steal.

We like basically everything we've tried from Verloop, and the whole site is 30 percent off with code HOLIDAY. (The Flower Knit Sock Slippers are pictured above.) Verloop's mini tote is one of reviewer Medea Giordano's favorites when she doesn't need to carry much. This is a slightly bigger option from the brand, and it's made from paper-thin nylon stuffed with scrap yarn. The result is a cool, colorful explosion reminiscent of the ’90s. There is a matching pouch too that you can use in whatever other bag you prefer. While it won't fit your laptop, you could comfortably carry a tablet or a Kindle. The biggest issue is just how loud the nylon is when you touch it. It's like walking with a chip bag.

We like a lot of Pit Viper's sunglasses. The brand is known for its neon, oversized sunnies and goggles. Styles we've tried successfully include the heart-shaped Admirers and the polarized Fondue, but there are oodles of styles to choose from. Discounts are applied automatically during checkout based on what you spend, ranging from 20 percent off to 50 percent off. Thanks to the savings, some pairs are on sale for less than $50. You can filter by price on the left-hand side of this page.

Every high school kid has a SuperBreak Plus, which is one of the most affordable laptop backpacks in our guide. The 600 denier fabric makes for a tough bag. You get a spacious main compartment, side bottle pocket, and an interior padded 15-inch laptop sleeve.

Darn Tough's merino wool socks are hard to beat. They're just great socks. These are only 60 percent merino, but that's pretty good for socks. We regularly see these drop this much at the end of the year when new styles and colors are on their way, but if you need to stock up on socks anyway, now's a good time.

We've written about Allbirds and the company's mission to make simple shoes out of sustainable materials many times. However, the best way to experience an Allbirds is probably with a warm, wool slipper. Many of the shoes are up to 70 percent off.

Girlfriend Collective clothing is made using recycled plastic bottles. We've now tried some of the brand's leggings, bras, dresses, and puffers, and each one has been comfortable to lounge in but cute enough to feel stylish while you're doing it. We particularly like the dresses with shorts underneath in the summertime.

PlayShifu Tacto Chess Learning Kit Photograph: PlayShifu

Your kids can learn to play chess by combining this kit with an iPad or Android tablet. It appears in our Best STEM Toys guide and uses physical pieces to teach the basics, from how the pieces move to strategies for victory. There are also puzzles and your kids can take on the AI or another opponent. Although it works with small tablets, we found the experience much better with a larger iPad. It has dropped this low before, but not recently.

Kids love to build stuff and The OffBits are a bunch of themed construction kits that combine special components with standard hardware bits you might have lying around the house, like nuts and screws. They are suitable for kids ages 6 and up, but small pieces and tricky assembly mean adult supervision is advisable. A few of their other kits are also discounted for Cyber Monday.

Merging the physical and digital world, this clever STEM kit for kids aged 6 years and up combines physical tiles with apps on your iPad or Fire tablet. This kit includes math and spelling exercises, alongside shape puzzles, and fun games. It appears in our Best STEM Toys for Kids guide. It is often discounted, and has been cheaper, but not for a long time. Some of the other Osmo kits are also on sale.

Senior product reviewer Scott Gilbertson got his first Petzel Tikka in 2000. It lasted 15 years and would probably still be going if he hadn't accidentally run it over. These will stand up to a lot, but not the full weight of car, as it turns out. He's now on his second Tikka, and he says it's still the best headlamp he's ever used. Truthfully, these days he uses a USB headlamp most of the time, but when he hits the trail he still takes the Tikka and a set of extra rechargeable batteries.

Reviewer Matt Jancer's favorite tape measure, the extra-thick FatMax resists folding in and collapsing when you're extending the tape far out without any support. This two-pack is only a dollar more than a single FatMax, so buy a spare and keep the other in the garage, your R/V, or just give one to a buddy, because you're just that nice.

This lightweight, efficient, compact stove is perfect for car camping and bike packing. We also like taking it to camping festivals. It's easy to use, and the fuel is cheap. We have seen the price dip lower, but this is still a good deal.

Senior product reviewer Scott Gilbertson loves this little coffee mug, which is nearly indestructible. It's hard to find a mug that isn't giant. If you're a fan of small mugs and need one for camping (or anywhere really) this is a great option.

This little filter lives at the bottom of senior product reviewer Scott Gilbertson's daypack because it's so light. Why not? He doesn't have to worry about lugging a ton of water if he knows that the trail crosses active streams and he has this thing with him. In fact, if you're an uber-ultralight weightist (and a little silly), you can skip the bottle entirely and just squirt this thing into your mouth while you vault across streams, sailing toward that summit.
