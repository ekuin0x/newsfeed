                <textarea id="text" readonly> We’re thrilled to announce our latest milestone – we’re expanding our crypto data API offering with our first-ever acquisition of industry-leading NFT data infrastructure & intelligence company, Zash.

Founded by CEO, Parit Patel and CTO, Efe Surekli in 2021 at Entrepreneur First, Zash provides enterprise-grade, indexed NFT data across 87 unique marketplaces on Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Solana and Bitcoin Ordinals. Zash covers NFT metadata, historical trades and lending data, and additionally deploys advanced data science techniques through its proprietary algorithms to detect wash trades at scale.

“We’re thrilled to complete the sale to CoinGecko – we can think of no better home to preserve the legacy of what we’ve built, than the outstanding brand CoinGecko has developed in the cryptocurrency space, over nearly a decade,” Parit commented. “We believe that NFTs will continue to evolve and unlock new use cases globally, creating value for companies and consumers. We foresee our NFT data infrastructure—well-positioned at CoinGecko—playing a pivotal and impactful role in shaping this industry’s future.”

Why Acquire Zash?

At CoinGecko, we hold the vision where any asset that can be tokenized, will be tokenized. In that same vein, we believe that NFTs will continue to innovate and unlock new opportunities worldwide. Acquiring Zash will allow us to supply you with fungible & non-fungible token (NFT) data seamlessly in one integrated offering. This is in line with our commitment to provide you with the most reliable, comprehensive and accurate cryptocurrency data, and brings us a step closer to empowering the decentralized future.

“After evaluating all existing NFT data providers in the space, Zash stands out as unparalleled. Within 3 years, they have built a remarkable product with the most comprehensive NFT data coverage in the market, and commercialized with top tier clients with a lean team,” noted TM Lee, CEO and co-founder of CoinGecko. “This acquisition aligns with our commitment and dedication to deliver exceptional value to the crypto community, starting with a unified token and NFT market data offering.”

What’s To Come

We’ll be incorporating new endpoints into our crypto data API by Q2 2024, covering:

Enterprise-grade, indexed NFT data across Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Bitcoin Ordinals and Solana

across Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Bitcoin Ordinals and Solana NFT metadata and historical trades

NFT lending data indexing Blend, X2Y2, NFTfi and more

indexing Blend, X2Y2, NFTfi and more Wash trading detection for major collections on Ethereum

If you’re interested in trying out these new NFT data API endpoints, do sign up to get waitlisted.

Additionally, Zash's NFT data infrastructure will be incrementally incorporated into our NFT floor price tracker next year.

CoinGecko Welcomes Zash

We celebrate what Zash has built and warmly welcome the team to CoinGecko. Looking ahead, we’re committed to a smooth transition and will continually enhance your crypto data API experience with us!
