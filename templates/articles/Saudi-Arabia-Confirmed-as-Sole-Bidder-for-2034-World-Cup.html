                <textarea id="text" readonly> With little hope of countering the Saudis’ influence and support, the Australian federation announced it was dropping out and would instead pursue other events.

“We wish FIFA and the eventual hosts of the FIFA World Cup 2034 the greatest success for the good of the game and for everyone who loves our sport,” the Australian federation said in a statement on its website.

A final announcement of the 2034 host will be made in the fourth quarter of 2024, FIFA said.

Saudi Arabia has in just a few years grown from an international backwater in sports to one of its major players, using its vast oil wealth to bring top stars to play in its cash-drenched soccer league; secure the biggest fights in boxing; and strike a deal to effectively seize control of global golf. All of the investments are viewed as part of a broader plan to alter perceptions of the kingdom on the global stage, and diversify its economy away from oil.

But inviting the World Cup — and the scrutiny it brings — would be among its boldest ventures yet.

Its neighbor Qatar spent more than a decade in the global spotlight after winning the hosting rights to the 2022 World Cup, becoming the first Arab and Muslim country to stage the event.

That tournament was not without controversy. For years, the buildup was marked by criticism of the tiny gas-rich state’s treatment of the millions of migrant laborers required to remake the country ahead of the World Cup. Saudi Arabia, while far more established on the world stage than Qatar was, is certain to face similar scrutiny. </textarea>
