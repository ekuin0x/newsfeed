                <textarea id="text" readonly> Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour continued its South American leg Friday in São Paulo, Brazil, where the singer performed another pair of deep cuts in the Surprise Songs segment of the show.

First, Swift went to her most recent release — 1989 (Taylor’s Version) — for the debut performance of “Now That We Don’t Talk,” one of the vault tracks from the rerelease LP.

“I’ve never performed this one live before, let’s see how I do with it,” Swift said before delivering the track on acoustic guitar. Despite its addition to the Swift catalog just weeks ago, it seemed like the entirety of the Allianz Parque audience knew the words by heart: Trending Details Emerge in Hall & Oates' Mysterious Legal Battle Harvey Weinstein Lost His Sh-t Over ‘Gossip Girl’ Aliens Are Out There — But They Probably Don’t Care About Us ‘Napoleon’: Ridley Scott’s Portrait of an Emperor as a Total Douchebag

Like Swift’s first show in Rio De Janiero, the Surprise Songs segment paired a newly unearthed track from 1989 (Taylor’s Version) with a long-forgotten gem from her early albums. This time around, Swift dusted off Speak Now’s “Innocent” for the first time since performing the track live at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards; the VMAs marked the only time Swift had ever played “Innocent” live, until Friday in São Paulo:

The Eras Tour will close out its South American leg (and 2023 dates) Saturday and Sunday in São Paulo. Swift will pick it up back up again in February 2024 with four nights in Tokyo, with those dates notably concluding February 10, or a night before the Super Bowl, in case someone in particular is playing in the Big Game. </textarea>
