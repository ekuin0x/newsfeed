                <textarea id="text" readonly> UPDATE: Nov. 25, 2023, 3:45 p.m. EST This story has been updated with a ton of new gaming laptop deals and some new top picks.

PC gaming isn't an easy hobby to get into. Complicated parts and big upfront costs create a pretty big barrier to entry for people looking to dip their toes into the medium. Thankfully, PC gaming laptops exist, and serve as a great introduction to PC gaming without requiring you to commit thousands of dollars to something you may not even end up liking. (Gaming laptops are also really good supplemental devices for already-experienced PC gamers.)

And with Cyber Weekend here, a ton of gaming laptops are discounted across a wide array of price ranges. If you were at all thinking about trying out a gaming laptop, now is the time to get one.

We scoured through all the gaming laptop deals we could find ahead of the big event, and put together a list of all our favorites for you. Check them out below, and keep checking back throughout the holiday season — we'll be updating this page with new deals as they go live.

Note: All newly added deals are marked with a ✨. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.

Early Cyber Monday gaming laptop deals

Why we like it

Out of all the gaming laptops on sale this Cyber Weekend, this configuration of last year's Razer Blade 15 has the biggest discount by far — an impressive $1,500 off its $3,299.99 MSRP. (If it sells out on Amazon, note that this offer was matched on the Razer website at the time of writing.) It features a high-end 12th-generation Intel Core i9 H-series CPU with 16GB of RAM, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti graphics, 1TB of storage, a 15-inch 240HZ OLED display, and a Chroma RGB keyboard. She's a beast and a beaut, and according to the Amazon price-tracking site camelcamelcamel, she's never been this cheap before.
