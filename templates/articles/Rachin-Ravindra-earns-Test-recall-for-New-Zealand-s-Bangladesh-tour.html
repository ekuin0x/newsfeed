(With inputs from Reuters)

NEW DELHI: New Zealand 's promising all-rounder Rachin Ravindra has received a well-deserved recall to the national squad for the upcoming two-Test tour of Bangladesh in November and December. The 23-year-old, who has impressed with his outstanding form in white-ball cricket at the World Cup, makes his way back into the Test squad, where he last played almost two years ago.Ravindra's performance at the World Cup, which included scoring three centuries, has caught the selectors' attention, earning him a spot in a spin-heavy squad set to compete in the matches to be held in Sylhet and Dhaka.In addition to Ravindra, the squad also includes left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner , who returns to Test cricket two years after his last appearance. The specialist spinners' department is further strengthened with the inclusion of Ajaz Patel and Ish Sodhi. Ravindra and fellow all-rounder Glenn Phillips offer additional slow-bowling options, underlining the squad's focus on spin.Kyle Jamieson, who underwent back surgery in February, has been named among the three fast bowlers, alongside skipper Tim Southee and Matt Henry. Notably, Trent Boult has made himself unavailable for the series, as New Zealand tours Bangladesh for the first time in a decade.Selector Sam Wells expressed confidence in the squad, stating, "We've selected a squad we think can compete and succeed in Bangladesh. With Ajaz, Ish, Mitch, Glenn, and Rachin, we have a strong spin group that will offer good variety and options during the series."For the tour, Luke Ronchi will take charge as the coach of the team, with head coach Gary Stead returning to New Zealand after the World Cup to prepare for the home summer.The first Test of the series is scheduled to begin on November 28 at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium.Tim Southee (captain), Tom Blundell, Devon Conway, Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Henry Nicholls, Ajaz Patel, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner, Ish Sodhi, Kane Williamson, Will Young </textarea>
