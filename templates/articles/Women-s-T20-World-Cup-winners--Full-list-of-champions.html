                <textarea id="text" readonly> New Zealand produced exceptional batting performances throughout the inaugural edition but were bundled out for just 85 in the final. England chased down the total with six wickets and three overs to spare. England’s Claire Taylor was named the player of the tournament.

The Women’s T20 World Cup, mostly held biennially, has been dominated by Australia since then. The team from Down Under has made all seven finals, winning six and losing just once in 2016 against the West Indies.

New Zealand were also the team to beat in the 2010 edition held in the West Indies. The Kiwis emerged unbeaten from the group stage with convincing wins and beat the hosts by 56 runs in the semi-finals. Ultimately, Australia won the title due to their ability to handle pressure better. They registered a super over win against England in the group stages, beat India by four runs in the semi-final and won the final by three runs after putting up just 106 on the scoreboard.

Australia won the 2012 edition in Sri Lanka with a narrow four-run victory over rivals England in the final. After putting up a challenging 142/4 on board, a collective bowling effort led by Jess Jonassen’s three-wicket haul helped Australia become the first team in the history of women’s T20 to defend its World Cup title.

With the T20 gaining popularity and the quality of the teams on the rise, the ICC made the Women’s T20 World Cup a 10-team affair 2014 edition onwards.

South Africa, India and the West Indies started to challenge the likes of New Zealand, England and Australia. However, Australia became the first country to win a hat-trick of T20 World Cup titles across men’s and women’s events with a six-wicket victory over England in the 2014 final in Mirpur. </textarea>
